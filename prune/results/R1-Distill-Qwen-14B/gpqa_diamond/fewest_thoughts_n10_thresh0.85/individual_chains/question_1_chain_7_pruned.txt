Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through this.

The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 1e-9 eV, B) 1e-11 eV, C) 1e-4 eV, D) 1e-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime (which is the uncertainty in time). The principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the product of the energy uncertainty and the time uncertainty is on the order of ħ.

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes are given. So Δt would be the lifetime τ of each state. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So a longer lifetime means a smaller energy uncertainty, meaning the energy levels can be measured more precisely.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't tell them apart—they would be smeared into one another.

So each state has its own uncertainty. Let's calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.

The formula from the uncertainty principle is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). Let me recall the values. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe it's easier to use the conversion where 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules.

Wait, but maybe I can find a simplified formula or value for ħ in eV·s units. I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. That's a useful conversion factor.

So substituting ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s into the formula, ΔE ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * τ).

Wait, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ), right? So τ is the lifetime, which is the uncertainty in time.

So for each state, calculate the energy uncertainty.

First state: τ1 = 1e-9 sec.

ΔE1 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) eV.

Let me compute that: 6.582e-16 divided by 2e-9 is 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7. 6.582 / 2 is about 3.291, so 3.291e-7 eV. So about 3.3e-7 eV.

Second state: τ2 = 1e-8 sec.

ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8) ) eV.

Calculate that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582/2) * 1e-8. 6.582/2 is 3.291, so 3.291e-8 eV. So about 3.3e-8 eV.

Wait, so the energy uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 3.3e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 3.3e-8 eV for the two states.

But the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. To resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE between them must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps larger than each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no. Because each state's uncertainty is about how precisely we can measure their energies. So the energy difference should be larger than the largest uncertainty, I think. Alternatively, maybe the required condition is that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

Wait, another approach: the resolving power of a measurement depends on the uncertainty. The energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state so that the two levels don't overlap in their energy distributions.

Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. So for the two states, the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 ≈ 3.
