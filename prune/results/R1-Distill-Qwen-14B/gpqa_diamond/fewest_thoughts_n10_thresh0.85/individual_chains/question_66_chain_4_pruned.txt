Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I should remember what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it's the full symmetry of special relativity. Operators in a field theory should respect these because they're part of the framework of the theory itself. So I think operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincare symmetry (2). So points 1 and 2 are in.

Then, what about CP and CPT? CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. The Standard Model (SM) respects these except for some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. But in the SMEFT, operators are built to respect the symmetries of the SM unless there's a reason not to. Wait, but are operators allowed to violate CP or CPT?

Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the SM. The SM respects CPT symmetry, so any effective theory should too. Because the SM's operators are CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT is built from them. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (4). But what about CP?

CP symmetry is a bit different. The SM has CP violation, but the effective operators must still respect the same symmetry structure as the SM. So, in the SMEFT, operators are constructed to respect the same symmetry as the SM. So if the SM doesn't have a certain symmetry, then SMEFT doesn't either. Wait, but the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So for example, if the SM allows for CP violation, then the SMEFT can have operators that violate CP. Therefore, it's not necessary that all operators in SMEFT respect CP symmetry. So CP symmetry (3) doesn't have to be respected by all operators.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which symmetries must be respected. So, if some operators violate CP, then not all operators respect it. But CPT is more fundamental. The SM respects CPT, so any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT. Because if an operator violates CPT, that would be a problem because the SM (and thus SMEFT) must respect it.

So, to recap: All operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. CP (3) isn't necessarily respected by all operators because some operators in SMEFT can violate CP.

So the required symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. But our conclusion is that 3 isn't necessarily required, so option C is correct.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine this, we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry is fundamental to the framework of SMEFT, as it governs the invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations and is the full symmetry of special relativity. Since SMEFT is built within the framework of relativistic field theory, all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation and parity. While the Standard Model (SM) respects CPT symmetry, it allows for CP violation in certain cases (e.g., in the CKM matrix). SMEFT is constructed to include all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the SM. Therefore, some operators in SMEFT can violate CP symmetry, meaning CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of the SM and must be preserved in any effective theory like SMEFT. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators.

**Conclusion**: The correct answer is the option that includes symmetries 1, 2, and 4.
