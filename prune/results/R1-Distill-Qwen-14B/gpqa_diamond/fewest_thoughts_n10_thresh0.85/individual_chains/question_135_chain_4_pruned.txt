Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about the bosonic field X and its interaction with fermions. The Lagrangian is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Hmm. I remember that in particle physics, the allowed decay products depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it can interact with. So the boson X can decay into a pair of fermions if the combined mass of the fermion pair is less than the mass of X.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. The general form is something like L = g ψ ψ X, where g is a coupling constant. So the interaction couples the boson X to two fermions.

But wait, the term is written as -λ f ψ_f (something like that). Maybe that's a typo or perhaps I'm misreading. Oh, probably it's something like L = -λ f ψ_f X ψ_f. No, wait, maybe the correct form is L = λ ψ_f^† X ψ_f, because the Yukawa interaction is usually a term that looks like X ψ ψ. So the interaction term would allow X to couple to a pair of fermions ψ_f.

So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the energy is sufficient. But wait, the mass of the fermion must be less than half the mass of X, because each fermion would take some energy. Because in the rest frame of X, the fermions would have to be created with equal and opposite momenta, so their rest mass must be less than half of X's mass.

X's mass is 6 GeV. So each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but real-world fermions have specific masses. Let's think about the known fermion masses.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

But wait, the up and down quarks are really light. Their masses are on the order of MeV, so way less than a GeV.

Strange quark is about 100 MeV, also way under 3 GeV.

Charm quark is about 1.5 GeV. So 3 GeV is 3*1000 MeV, so 1.5 GeV per charm quark. So 2m_c = 3 GeV? Wait, 2 times 1.5 is 3, so yes. So a pair of charm quarks would require 2 * m_c = 3 GeV. So X can decay into c cbar, because 3 GeV is exactly equal to the mass? Or is it more?

Wait, but the mass of X is 6 GeV. The rest mass of each fermion must be less than X's mass divided by 2, so 3 GeV. So the maximum mass is 3 GeV per fermion.

Charm is about 1.5 GeV, so 2 * 1.5 = 3, so it's allowed.

What about bottom quarks? The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. Wait, no. Wait, bottom quark's mass is around 4.7 GeV. So if each bottom quark is 4.7 GeV, then two would require 9.4 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar, because that would require 9.4 GeV > 6 GeV. So option A and D have b bbar, which would not be allowed. So options A and D can be eliminated, because their decays include b bbar.

Next, top quark is way heavier. Top is about 173 GeV, so no way. So any decay into t tbar is impossible.

What about leptons? Electrons, muons, taus.

Electron mass is about 0.0005 GeV. So yes, can decay into e+ e-.

Same for muon, about 0.1 GeV. So 2 * 0.1 is 0.2 GeV, way less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into mu+ mu-.

Tau lepton is about 1.78 GeV. So 2 * 1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So tau pair is not allowed. So X cannot decay into tau+ tau-.

Wait, wait! Let me think again. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So each tau is about 1.78 GeV. So two taus would sum to 3.56 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So the decay X→tau+ tau- is not kinematically allowed because 3.56 GeV > 3 GeV. So any option that includes tau+ tau- would not be allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Includes tau pair, so not allowed.

Option B: Includes tau pair. So can't be allowed.

Option C: Includes tau pair
