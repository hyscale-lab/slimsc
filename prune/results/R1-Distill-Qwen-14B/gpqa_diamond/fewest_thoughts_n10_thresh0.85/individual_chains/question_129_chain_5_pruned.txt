Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. The reaction steps are:

1. A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

Additionally, there are some hints provided. Let's break it down.

First, let's look at the hints.

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides. So, if A reacts with a ylide to form an alkene, that suggests that A has a carbonyl group (either aldehyde or ketone).

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The substituents are at 1 and 2 positions, and there's a propenylidene group at 4. So the starting material A must have a carbonyl group adjacent to a cyclopentane structure. Wait, when the Wittig reaction occurs, it forms an alkene by replacing the carbonyl group. So A would be a cyclopentane ring with a ketone or aldehyde at the position where the ylide adds.

Wait, the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene), which is a substituent on the cyclopentane ring. So the ylide would have added to a carbonyl group attached to the cyclopentane. So perhaps A is cyclopentanone, but with substituents. Let's think: the product after ylide reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, the numbering is probably such that the substituents are on adjacent carbons, and the ylide adds where?

Alternatively, perhaps A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let me draw this out mentally. Suppose A is 4-methylcyclopentanone. Then, the Wittig reagent (ylide) would attack the carbonyl, forming an alkene adjacent to that position. So the product would have a double bond between carbons 4 and 5 (if the numbering is such that the ketone was at 4). But wait, in the product, the substituents are at 1,2, and 4. Hmm, maybe the starting material is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, the Wittig would convert the ketone into an alkene. So if A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone, reacting with a propylidene ylide (like CH2CH2CH2 group) would form a new double bond.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has two methyl groups at 1 and 2. The propan-2-ylidene group is at position 4. Propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-CH(CH2Ph) group? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)= something? Wait, the ylide is usually Ph3P=CH-CH(CH3) maybe?

Wait, in the product, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is a group like CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but as a ylide, it's CH2-C(CH3)-. So when the Wittig reagent adds, it forms a double bond. So the product would have a new double bond between, say, positions 4 and 5, with the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene) cyclopentane. So the structure would have a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between carbons 4 and 5 (since the ylide adds to the carbonyl in A), and the substituents from the ylide would be attached to carbon 4.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Wittig reaction forms an alkene from a carbonyl group. So, if A is a cyclopentanone (cyclopentane with a ketone), then the ylide would attack the carbonyl carbon, forming a new double bond.

So, for example, if A is 4-methylcyclopentanone, then after reaction with the ylide, the ketone at position 4 would be replaced by a CH2 group connected via a double bond to the rest. Wait, maybe the position of the substituents determines how the ylide adds.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, the Wittig would form a double bond adjacent to the ketone position. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should try another approach.

Let's look at the other hint. Hint b says that the IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, most likely a ketone or aldehyde. The IR of E is around 1715 cm^-1, which is also a carbonyl, maybe a ketone as well but perhaps a different environment.

So, the steps are:

A + HCN → B

B (with H2 and Pd) →
