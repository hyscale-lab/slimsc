Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines corresponds to the star's movement towards and away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the main thing here is the Doppler shifts detected for each planet.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period of the planet? I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (P/(2π))^(−1/3). Wait, maybe I should think about the formula more carefully.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula: K = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) )^(1/3) )) * (1 / (2π)) )

But since the planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are like the Sun, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so that term becomes 1. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, another way: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) ) * something else? Wait, perhaps the formula is K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Alternatively, I think the formula I should remember is K = (v) = [ ( (G * P ) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) ]

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit, the period, the mass of the star, and the distance.

The standard formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) ) / (2π)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the ratio of the velocities. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, but the Doppler shifts are different.

Wait, the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. So, K is the velocity semi-amplitude of the star. So, K1 is 5 milliangstrom per some unit, K2 is 7 milliangstrom. Or wait, the question says the shift is 5 and 7 milliangstrom. So, K1 = 5, K2 =7? Or is the shift inversely proportional to something else?

Wait, no, the Doppler shift (as in the actual wavelength shift) is proportional to velocity, right? Because the Doppler effect formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v/c. So a larger velocity gives a larger delta_lambda. So, if K is the velocity of the star, then delta_lambda is proportional to K.

So, if for planet 1, the shift is 5 milliangstrom, and for planet 2, it's 7 milliangstrom, then K1/K2 = 5/7. So K1 = (5/7) K2.

But wait, wait. Wait, the question is about the orbital period. So, we're comparing P2 to P1. We need to find P2/P1.

Let me look for the relation between K and P.

The formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = ( ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(2π)) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the formula can be written as:

K = [ ( (27 * pi) / (2 * G) )^(1/3) ] * ( (M_planet sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star) )^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps another approach: The formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( c * (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should recall the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period. Let me think about the formula from another angle.

The formula for K is given by:

K = (v) = (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * ( (G/(2π))^(1/3) ) / (P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) )^(1/3) )) ) / (2π)^(1/3) )

But since e=0, this simplifies.

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula as:

K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / ( (P) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2π c )) )

Hmm, maybe this isn't leading me anywhere. Alternatively, maybe I can find the relationship between K and P.

Since both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), and the stars have the same mass (similar to Sun), the only variables are K and P.

So, for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, more accurately, because K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, let's think about the formula again. The general formula for K is:

K = [ (27 * pi / (2 * c^3)) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

So, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_p is same for both planets (both Neptune-like), and M_star is same for both, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3 )

So, K ∝ 1 / (P)^(1/3 )

Which means that P ∝ 1 / (K)^(3) )

Wait, no. Because K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 ), so P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K. So, P ∝ (1/K)^3. So P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

But wait, K is the velocity which causes the Doppler shift. So, K1 and K2 are different.

Wait, in the question, for planet 1, the shift is 5 milliangstrom, and for planet 2, it's 7. So, K1 is 5 and K2 is7? Or is it the other way around?

No, wait, the Doppler shift is directly proportional to the velocity. So, if planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom, then the star for planet #1 is moving with a smaller velocity (since 5 <7). Because a larger velocity would cause a larger shift.

Wait no, wait: if the star is moving faster, the Doppler shift is larger. So, K1 = 5, K2 =7, but K is velocity. So, K2 > K1. So, because K is higher, the period would be shorter?

Wait, according to the earlier proportionality, K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3). So, P ∝ 1/(K)^(3).

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 would be smaller than P1. Because P is inversely proportional to K^3.

Wait, no, let's see:

If K1 is 5, K2 is7.

K2 = (7/5) K1.

So, K2 / K1 = 7/5.

Since P is proportional to (1/K)^3, then P2/P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.36 times P1. That means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, planet #2's period is shorter. Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 is ~0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

But wait, what's the question? How many times longer is the period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So, if P2 is 0.36 P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So, the period of planet #2 is shorter. So, the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1? So, if the answer is 0.36, that would mean planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's, so it's shorter. So the option A is correct.

Wait, but in the setup, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So, if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times, which is shorter. So the correct option is A.

Another way to think: if the RV semi-amplitude K is larger, that implies a shorter period. Because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P. So, higher K means shorter P.

So, larger K (planet #2) implies shorter period. So, planet #2 has a shorter period. So, the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1. So, how many times longer is P2 than P1? About 0.36 times. So the option A is correct.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, denoted as \( K \), which is related to the orbital period \( P \) through the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that the orbital period \( P \) is inversely proportional to the cube of the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \):

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

In the question, Planet #1 causes a Doppler shift of 5 milliangstrom, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstrom. Since the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity \( K \), we have:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5}
\]

The orbital period ratio \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) is inversely proportional to the cube of the velocity ratio:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
