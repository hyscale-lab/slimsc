Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are from A to D, each a different inverse power of plx.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So if plx is small, the star is far away, and if plx is large, the star is nearby. But wait, actually, no, I think it's the other way around. Oh wait, no, parallax angle is measured in arcseconds, and the formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / plx. So a larger plx means a closer star because the parallax angle is bigger when the star is closer.

The question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So, how does the number of stars in a thin shell at a certain distance depend on the parallax? Because if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density is uniform.

Let me think. The density is uniform, so the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. So for a given distance range, the volume of the spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by dr. So the volume element is 4πd² dr.

But what's parallax in terms of d? Parallax plx is 1/d. So d is 1/plx. So substituting, let me write d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d.

So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π*(1/plx)^2 * (dr). But since plx is 1/d, dr is the change in d. Wait, but I need to express everything in terms of plx. So dr = d * dplx (since plx = 1/d, so dplx = - (1/d²) dd, but maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think in terms of differentials.

Let me express the volume in terms of plx. So d is 1/plx. So the differential volume element for a thin shell would be 4π d² * (thickness in distance). But the thickness in distance, dr, would correspond to a change in plx, dplx. So how are dr
