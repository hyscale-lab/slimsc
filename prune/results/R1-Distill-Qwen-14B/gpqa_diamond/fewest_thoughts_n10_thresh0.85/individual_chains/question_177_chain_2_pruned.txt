Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, which I think relates to their temperatures. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. But wait, the question is about their luminosities, so I'm not sure how the velocities play into this yet.

The astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. And the options are A to D.

Hmm. So, luminosity of a star—right, the basic formula is Luminosity (L) = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we're comparing two stars, the constants might cancel out.

Wait, the problem says both stars radiate as black bodies, so that formula applies to both.

The first thing I notice is that the peak wavelength for both stars is the same. Oh, right! Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So T1 = T2.

So both stars have the same temperature. That's important because when you calculate luminosity with L=4πR²σT⁴, if T is same for both, L is proportional to R² each multiplied by T^4. But wait, T is same, so L is proportional to R².

So, for Star_1, L1 is proportional to (R1)^2, and for Star_2, L2 is proportional to (R2)^2. Since R1 = 1.5 R2, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the computed luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So according to this, it would be 2.25. So the answer would be option A, which is ~2.25. But wait, the options don't have exactly 2.25 except option A. But wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s. Did I miss something? How does velocity affect luminosity? Hmm, I thought luminosity is about intrinsic brightness, which depends on radius and temperature. Wait, but maybe the radial velocity is a distractor, or perhaps it's about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength, but the problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are same, but the intrinsic temperatures might be different?

Wait, that's a possibility. Oh wait a second! Because if the stars are moving, their emitted wavelengths could be Doppler shifted. So the peak wavelength we observe could be different from the actual emitted wavelength. So maybe the actual temperatures of the stars are different, because of their velocities.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength of maximum emission would be shifted.

So, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so no shift. Star_2 has radial velocity of 700 km/s. So we need to calculate the Doppler shift for Star_2 and find its actual temperature.

Wait, let me think. The observed wavelength (λ_observed) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emit) by the Doppler formula. For a star moving away, λ_observed = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if the star is moving away, the wavelength would be redshifted, so longer. So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed λ is longer than its emitted λ.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ for both is same. So in reality, Star_1's emitted λ (λ1) and Star_2's emitted λ (λ2) could be different because of their velocities.

Wait, but no. Let me clarify: the star emits at a certain peak λ, but due to Doppler effect, we observe a different λ. But the problem says that the observed λ is the same for both stars. So the observed wavelengths are same, so we can write:

λ1_observed = λ2_observed.

But λ_observed = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but wait, no, wait. The full Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c) / sqrt(1 - v_r²/c²) ), but for non-relativistic speeds, v << c, this can be approximated as λ_observed ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r / c).

But wait, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ1_observed = λ1_emit. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. So λ2_observed = λ2_emit * (1 + 700/(3e5)) ) approximately. Because c is about 3e5 km/s.

Wait, 700 km/s is much less than c (3e5 is 300,000 km/s), so 700 is 0.002333... times c. So the approximation (1 + v_r / c) is valid.

So, for Star_1, λ1_observed = λ1_emit.

For Star_2, λ2_observed = λ2_emit * (1 + 700 / 3e5 ) ≈ λ2_emit * (1 + 0.002333... )

But the problem says λ1_observed = λ2_observed. So:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + 0.002333 )

Which implies that λ2_emit is less than λ1_emit. Because (1 + 0.002333 ) is approximately 1.002333. So λ1_emit = 1.002333 * λ2_emit → λ2_emit = λ1_emit / 1.002333 ≈ λ1_emit * (1 - 0.002333 )

So, the emitted wavelengths are different. So the actual temperatures of the stars are different.

Wait, because according to Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T. So T = b / λ_emit.

So T1 = b / λ1_emit,
