Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The question mentions Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, which is around 4°C. So, maybe B is a solid that melts just above freezing? 

Then, it says that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Hmm. My first thought is that X might be something like a strong base, maybe NaOH or KOH, because those are common reagents and can react violently with acids. Wait, but the question says it's a keto acid reacting with X. Wait, a keto acid is an acid that has a ketone group, like something like acetoacetic acid or similar.

So, when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think: maybe X is a metal that reacts with the acid. For example, if X is NaOH, then when it reacts with a keto acid like CH3COCH2COOH, the reaction would produce a sodium salt and water. But sodium hydroxide reacting with a carboxylic acid typically gives a salt and water. So the product would be something like CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+ and H2O. The product in this case, the salt, would have the keto acid's oxygen (like from the carboxylate group). Wait, but the product's molecule contains 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe the product is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the other parts of the question. The gas W released has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. So, H2O has 10 neutrons (O has 8, H has 1 each; total protons: 2 H and 8 O = 10; neutrons: 8 (since O-16 has 8 neutrons) + 2*0 (H) = 8. So protons 10, neutrons 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, another possibility. If W is CO2, then it has 1 C, 2 O. Protons: 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22. Neutrons: 6 (C has 6 neutrons in C-12) + 2*(8) = 6 +16=22. So protons 22, neutrons 22. That fits the description. So W is CO2. That makes sense because if X is a strong base reacting with an acid, like a carbonate reacting with acid, you'd get CO2. Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If Y is a liquid, maybe it's water? No, but the reaction is X with Y. Let's see.

Wait, X reacting with Y (liquid) gives W (CO2) and precipitate G. When G is heated, it gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Hmm, 277 K is roughly 4°C. Which solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water ice? Wait, but water melts at 273 K (0°C). 277 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe something like ammonium nitrate? No, that's a different melting point. Wait, another thought: maybe B is sodium hydroxide? No, NaOH is a solid but it's usually in a hydrated form. Wait, if B is sodium carbonate? No, sodium carbonate is more like a white solid.

Wait, maybe when G is heated, it decomposes into something. Let's think: if G is a carbonate, heating it might release CO2 and leave behind a metal oxide. But I'm a bit stuck here. Let's try to think about the other parts.

The product from the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. If X is a metal, like sodium, then reacting with a keto acid (a carboxylic acid with a ketone group) would produce a metal salt. For example, if X is NaOH, then the reaction with a keto acid like CH3CO2H (acetic acid) would produce NaOOCCH3 and water. The sodium salt would have the acetate group. Acetate has two oxygen atoms in the ion (OOC-). So the product (the salt) would have two oxygen atoms in the acetate group. That would fit the description. So the product would have 2 O atoms, like in the acetate ion.

So, perhaps X is NaOH. But wait, in the first part, X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope. So if X is NaOH, the heavier isotope would be in Na. The natural abundance of Na is mostly Na-23 (about 100%), but maybe the problem is referring to a heavier isotope, like Na-24 or Na-25? Hmm, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe it's another element in X. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Another common reagent is KOH. Wait, but KOH is a strong base too, but its analogs might be other hydroxides. Alternatively, maybe it's something like LiAlH4, but that's a reducing agent. Alternatively, maybe X is something like H2SO4, but that's more of an acid.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. If X is a hydroxide and it reacts with a liquid Y, maybe Y is a salt solution. Or wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

If X is NaOH, which is a solid, reacting with a liquid Y. Let me think, what would happen when NaOH reacts with a liquid. If Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3 in water? No, NaOH and Na2CO3 wouldn't react. Alternatively, Y could be a metal carbonate. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal salt solution. For example, if Y is a solution of a metal nitrate, and X is something like NaOH, then the reaction would form a precipitate of the hydroxide. But wait, the reaction of NaOH with a nitrate solution would give a precipitate only if the metal hydroxide is insoluble. For example, if Y is Cu(NO3)2, then NaOH would react to form Cu(OH)2 precipitate. But then, when heated, the precipitate would decompose into CuO and water. Hmm, but in that case, gas W would be H2O, I think. But earlier, we thought W was CO2. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between X (a base) and Y (a carbonate), which would produce CO2. For example, if Y is a sodium carbonate solution, but X is a hydroxide. Wait, but NaOH and Na2CO3 wouldn't react. Alternatively, X could be a metal carbonate, but that doesn't fit because X is the base.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the gas W again. We thought it was CO2 because the protons and neutrons are equal, but let's think of other possibilities. Another gas with same protons and neutrons: for example, H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 8 (from O-16) + 2*(0) = 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

What about CH4? No, that's a hydrocarbon. Or maybe something like NH3? Let's see: NH3 has 14 protons (1 N and 3 H) and 14 neutrons (N has 7, H has 0). So yes, NH3 would fit because 14 protons and 14 neutrons. But would that make sense in the reaction?

Wait, but if W is NH3, maybe the reaction is between an acid and a metal, producing ammonia. But I'm not sure how that would fit here. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think again about the options. Another possible molecule is O2. O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons (since O-16 has 8 neutrons, but O2 would have 2 atoms so 16 protons total, neutrons 8*2=16). So yes, O2 would fit. But would a reaction between X and Y produce O2? That could be via a decomposition reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal, like Mg, and reacts with an acid, it produces H2 gas. H2 has 2 H atoms, so protons 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps CO2 is the correct gas.

So if W is CO2, then the reaction between X and Y (liquid) produces CO2. So perhaps X is a carbonate, because reacting a carbonate with an acid would release CO2. But wait, the problem says X is a base, like NaOH, which would react with a carbonate. Wait, but X is a base, Y is a liquid. Alternatively, Y could be a carbonate solution.

Wait, but if X is NaOH, and Y is a carbonate like Na2CO3, then they would react. But NaOH + Na2CO3 would just form Na2CO3·H2O or something, but I don't think it would produce CO2. Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate solution, and X is a strong acid. Wait, but X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, so maybe it's a strong base like KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.
