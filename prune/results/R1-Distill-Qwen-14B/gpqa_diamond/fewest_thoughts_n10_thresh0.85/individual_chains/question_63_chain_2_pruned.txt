Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

Alright, the question says the molecule is modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state... I remember that for a molecule, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. But in this case, since it's rotation-vibration, I think the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state. Or maybe the next state refers to a higher vibrational state. Hmm, not sure yet.

The problem gives masses Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. Oh right, the bond length R is 2 angstroms. And the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. The options are for the photon's momentum.

So, the molecule absorbs a photon, and that photon's momentum will cause a transition. I think that in quantum mechanics, when a photon is absorbed, its energy must match the energy difference between two states of the system. But wait, since this is a rotation-vibration model, maybe the transition involves both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, wait, the next state after the fundamental state would be the next higher energy state. So the fundamental state is the ground state of vibration and the ground state of rotation. So, the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question says the lowest possible energy, so perhaps the minimal energy required is the vibrational transition? Or maybe the rotational?

Wait, but in terms of energy levels, vibrational energy levels are higher than rotational ones. No, wait, no. Wait, rotational and vibrational are separate. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0). The next state could be either v=1 (next vibration) or J=1 (next rotation). But which one requires less energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) hω
