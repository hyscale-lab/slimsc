Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W, a precipitate G, and then B when heated. Also, there are some clues about the products and the properties of these substances.

First, let me parse the information given. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is probably a diatomic molecule or a compound where one of the atoms is an isotope, maybe like deuterium in H2O as D2O or something similar. Then, when X reacts with Y, it produces gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. That's interesting because such a molecule would have an atom where the number of neutrons equals protons, which would be a hydrogen isotope but wait, hydrogen has one proton and one neutron in deuterium. Wait, no, deuterium is H with one proton and one neutron. So if the molecule is H2, each H has one proton and zero neutrons, but that's not equal. Hmm, wait, maybe W is something like CO2 or another molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Alternatively, perhaps W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think: for example, carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons in its isotope C-12. So if the molecule is CO2, each C is 12C (6 protons, 6 neutrons), each O is 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So in CO2, each C has 6 and 6, each O has 8 and 8. So the protons and neutrons per atom are equal in CO2. So gas W could be CO2. But wait, another possibility is H2O. Let me check: H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So in H2O, each H has 1p, 0n, O has 8p, 8n. So the H's don't satisfy the condition, but the O does. So the entire molecule's atoms don't all have equal p and n. So maybe W is CO2.

So when X reacts with Y, they produce CO2 as gas. Also, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Which solid has a melting point around there? Wait, maybe it's 273 K, which is 0 degrees C. But the question says very close to 277 K, so maybe it's a solid like ice? No, because ice melts at 273 K. 277 is a bit higher, perhaps something like a different solid. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal that melts around that temperature. Wait, but I'm not sure, let's think later.

The next clue: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two oxygen atoms. What's a keto acid? Keto acids are those with a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. Maybe like acetoacetic acid or something similar. But the reaction product's molecule has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, wait, perhaps the product is H2O? Because when X reacts with a keto acid, maybe it's a neutralization reaction, producing water and something else. But wait, the product has two O atoms, so perhaps it's water, which has one O atom. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a carbonate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid derivative.

Wait, the problem says the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Maybe it's something like CO2, but that's gas W. Or perhaps it's another molecule. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something like a dehydration, but that's not clear yet.

Another point: substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. That makes me think of something like NaOH, KOH, or possibly other strong bases. Wait, but if X is a base, like NaOH, which is used in a lot of organic reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's something like DMSO (but DMSO is more of a polar aprotic solvent). Wait, wait, X has an isotope which is heavier. So maybe X is a heavy water analog, like D2O. Wait, but D2O is a heavy isotope of water. So in that case, when D2O reacts with something, perhaps a liquid Y. Let's think about possible reactions.

If X is D2O, reacting with a liquid Y, which could be something like concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or another strong acid. Wait, but H2SO4 is a liquid. So when D2O reacts with H2SO4, what happens? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid, like H2SO4, and X is NaOH. Wait, but NaOH is a solid, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, going back: the reaction of X with Y produces gas W (maybe CO2), precipitate G, and when G is heated, B is released. Let me think about the possible reactions. Maybe X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, leading to CO2 gas. So if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and Y is H2SO4. Then the reaction would produce Na2SO4, H2O, and CO2. But wait, in this case, Y is H2SO4, a liquid. The precipitate G would be Na2SO4? No, Na2SO4 is soluble. Alternatively, if X is a metal carbonate, perhaps with another product. Wait, but the precipitate might be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide. Let's think. If X is NaOH (a solid), but Y is a liquid, like concentrated HCl. Then the reaction would be NaOH + HCl â†’ NaCl + H2O. But in that case, no gas is produced. Hmm. But the reaction produces gas W, so maybe Y is a carbonate. Wait, not sure.

Wait, the product of X reacting with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is H2O. So when X is a base, perhaps in the reaction with a keto acid (like a saponification or something), it produces water. For example, if X is NaOH, and the keto acid is something like a ketone with a carboxylic acid group, the reaction could hydrolyze to form water and a carboxylic acid.

Let me think about the possible structure of X. Since X is a reagent used in organic chemistry and has an isotope, maybe it's something like D2O, which is heavy water. So X would be D2O. Then, when X reacts with Y, which is perhaps
