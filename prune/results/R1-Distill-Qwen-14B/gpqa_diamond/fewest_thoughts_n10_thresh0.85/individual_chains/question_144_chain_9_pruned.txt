Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's see if I can work through this step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are: production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 meters or so, which makes sense because particles decay quickly, so the distance should be very small.

Wait, I remember that the decay width is related to the particle's lifetime. The width Γ is connected to the mean lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula should be Γ ≈ ħ / τ, but wait, more accurately, τ is the mean lifetime, and Γ is the total decay width. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The decay width Γ is the energy width of the particle's resonance, and it's related to the lifetime. So the mean lifetime is inversely proportional to Γ. But I think more precisely, the uncertainty principle gives ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for a particle decaying, the energy uncertainty ΔE is Γ, so Δt ≈ ħ/(Γ). So the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ/(Γ).

Once I have the lifetime τ, the mean decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. The formula is L = v * τ. But wait, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. To get v, I can use the relativistic equations.

The meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, which is the total energy. The mass is m_X =1.2 GeV, so I can find the velocity from the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E is gamma * m c^2, and the momentum p is gamma * m v.

Alternatively, the relativistic relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p.

Let me compute p first. E is 8 GeV, m is
