Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

First, I need to figure out what's happening in each part. Let's break it down.

**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**
The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.040 L). To find the new concentration after dilution, I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.020 L. M2 is what we're looking for, V2 is 0.040 L.

So, M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 0.020) / 0.040 = (0.001) / 0.040 = 0.025 M. Oh, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

**Step 2: Titration with NaOH**
The NaOH solution is 0.1 M. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, what's the equivalence point? It's when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially.

So, first, calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Moles = M * V = 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 moles. Because 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001 (since 0.025 is 1/40, 1/40 * 40 mL is 1 mmol, perhaps? Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, 0.05 M is 0.001 mol, so after dilution, it's 0.0005? Wait wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, original volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M. Moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, so total volume is 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's right.

So, moles acetic acid = 0.001 mol. To reach equivalence, moles of NaOH should be 0.001 mol because the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O).

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so
