Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios in two different energy bands. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but I'll try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, and I need to find the ratio of the fluxes in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with various ratios.

Wait, first, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton (pp) chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch is the initial reaction where two protons fuse with a deuteron to form helium-3. The pp-II branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei to make boron-8 and two protons. Then, the pp-III branch is when boron-8 decays, right? Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The pp-III branch is actually another part of the pp chain, perhaps involving higher energy reactions. Or wait, maybe the pp-III branch is where the boron-8 produced in pp-II undergoes further reactions. Because boron-8 has a half-life of about 8 minutes, it decays into lithium-7 and a positron. Hmm, but how does this affect neutrinos?

Neutrinos are produced in several steps in the Sun. The main ones are the pep reaction (which is part of the pp-I branch), the dominant pp-II branch, and the boron-8 decay in pp-III. Oh wait, wait. The dominant source of solar neutrinos comes from the pp-I and pp-II reactions. The pp-III is a minor contributor, I think. Or maybe not?

Wait, when the pp-III branch stops, what happens? The pp-III reactions are the ones where the boron-8 captures a proton to form helium-4 and emits a positron and two neutrinos (I think). Oh wait, no, maybe the boron-8 decay itself emits neutrinos. Let me recall: when boron-8 (B-8) is formed, it is unstable and decays via positron emission into lithium-7 (Li-7) plus a positron and a neutrino. So each B-8 decay releases a neutrino (a ν_e, I believe). So the pp-III branch is actually about the decay of B-8, which is a significant source of neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that means no more B-8 decay. Therefore, the flux of neutrinos from B-8 decay would drop to zero. But wait, the question says the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Is 8.5 minutes the half-life of B-8? Oh, right, B-8's half-life is about 84.6 seconds, which is about 1.4 minutes. Wait, no, wait, that's not correct. Wait, 84.6 seconds is like a little over a minute. No, wait, 84.6 seconds is about a minute and a half. So if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that's much longer than the half-life of B-8. So any B-8 produced before that would have decayed away already. So perhaps the immediate effect is that the B-8 abundance is zero.

Wait, but the pp-III reactions also include other processes, like the capture of a proton by B-8 to make Be-9, but perhaps that's not the main source of neutrinos. The main neutrinos from pp-III are from the decay of B-8. So if that process stops, the neutrino flux from B-8 decay would stop.

But wait, the Sun's neutrino flux comes predominantly from two processes: the dominant is the pp-I and pp-II reactions. The pp-I reaction (I think) is the initial step: two protons fusing to form deuterium and a positron, which emits a neutrino. The pp-II is the fusion of two deuterons to form helium-4 and two protons, which emits two neutrinos. But wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

In the pp chain, the main steps are:

1. Two protons (p) collide to form a deuterium nucleus (D) and emit a positron (e+) and a neutrino (ν_e). This is the pp-I branch.
2. Two deuterium nuclei (D + D) fuse to form helium-4 (He-4) and release two protons (p). This is the pp-II branch and emits two neutrinos (ν_e each) because each step involves a positron and neutrino emission.

Wait, actually, wait. The pp-I reaction is p + p → D + e+ + ν_e. The pp-II reaction is D + D → He-4 + 2p. And the pp-III branch is when He-4 captures a proton to form B-8: He-4 + p → B-8 + γ. Then, B-8 decays via positron emission: B-8 → Li-7 + e+ + ν_e. So that's the pp-III process, which produces neutrinos.

So the main sources of ν_e from the pp chain are:

- The pp-I process (p + p → D + e+ + ν_e): Each produces a ν_e.
- The pp-II process (D + D → He-4 + 2p): Each produces two ν_e, but wait, no, because I think each D has a positron and a neutrino from its formation. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, each D is formed via pp-I, which emits a ν_e. So each D has one ν_e. Then, when two D's fuse, each had a ν_e, so two ν_e are emitted in total. So the pp-II process emits two ν_e.

The pp-III process is the He-4 + p → B-8, and then B-8 decays, emitting a ν_e. So each B-8 decay emits one ν_e.

So the total ν_e flux from the Sun comes from these sources. Now, the question is, what happens when the pp-III branch stops. So the B-8 production stops, and the decay process of existing B-8 would continue, but since 8.5 minutes have passed since the pp-III stopped, and the B-8 half-life is about 84.6 seconds (about 1.4 minutes), then after 8.5 minutes, almost all the B-8 would have decayed. Because 8.5 minutes is about 6 half-lives (since 8.5 / 1.4 ≈ 6). So after 6 half-lives, the remaining B-8 is 1/(2^6) ≈ 1/64, which is about 1.56% of the original amount. So any B-8 present after the pp-III stopped would have almost all decayed, so the neutrino flux from B-8 decay would be negligible compared to the other sources.

So the main sources of neutrinos would still be the pp-I and pp-II reactions.

Now, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So what determines the energy of the neutrinos from these reactions?

The pp-I neutrinos: Each pp-I reaction emits a neutrino with an energy around 420 keV (I think). So if the pp-I is the main source, then neutrinos in this band might be from the pp-I process.

The pp-II process emits two neutrinos per reaction. Each has higher energy, I believe. Let me think: the pp-II reaction produces He-4 and two protons, releasing energy. The neutrinos emitted in this process have energies in the range of about 500-800 keV or so. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact energies, but I'll need to think about the typical energies.

Wait, the energy released in the pp-I reaction is about 0.42 MeV, all going into the positron and neutrino. So the neutrino energy is about 0.42 MeV (420 keV). The pp-II reaction: the energy comes from the binding energy of He-4. The mass of two deuterons is about 2*(2.014895 u) = 4.02979 u. The mass of He-4 is 4.002603 u. The mass difference is about 0.027192 u. 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so 0.027192 * 931.5 ≈ 25.3 MeV. But wait, that's the binding energy for the two D's fusing into He-4. But neutrinos are emitted in the pp-II reaction, but their energies would be lower. Since each D is a result of the pp-I reaction, which emits a neutrino of about 420 keV, so two D's would have two neutrinos, each about 420 keV. So in the pp-II reaction, two neutrinos are emitted, each about 420 keV. So the energies of these neutrinos would be around 420 keV each.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing things up. Because in the pp-II reaction, the two D's collide and fuse into He-4. Each D was formed via the pp-I reaction, which emits a neutrino. So during the pp-II reaction, each D contributes a neutrino. So each D carries away a neutrino when it's formed. So the pp-II process doesn't directly emit neutrinos, but the neutrinos are from the earlier pp-I steps. So the neutrinos from the pp-II process are the same as the pp-I, but perhaps in a different energy distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II process emits neutrinos with higher energies. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the pp-I reaction, each emission is about 420 keV. The pp-II reaction produces two neutrinos, but perhaps their energies are higher. Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos from the pp-II process are emitted with higher energies because the binding energy is higher. Alternatively, maybe the pp-II process doesn't emit neutrinos directly, but the neutrinos come from the pp-I steps that lead to the D's.

Wait, perhaps the main point is that the pp-II process contributes neutrinos with higher energies than the pp-I. For example, the pp-I neutrinos are around 420 keV, while the pp-II neutrinos are in the range of, say, 800 keV or higher.

Wait, but another source says that the dominant solar neutrino flux comes from the pp-I and pp-II reactions. The pp-I neutrinos have energies around 400-500 keV, and the pp-II neutrinos have higher energies, around 800 keV or so. So for the pp-II process, each fusion produces two neutrinos, each of about 800 keV. So that would place them in the 800 keV range.

But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's perhaps look at the typical neutrino energies from each process.

- The pp-I reaction (p + p → D + e+ + ν_e): neutrino energy ≈ 0.42 MeV (420 keV).
- The pp-II reaction (D + D → He-4 + 2p): each D comes from a pp-I reaction, so each has a neutrino. But when the two D's fuse, do they emit additional neutrinos? Or do they just emit the two from the pp-I steps? I think the pp-II reaction itself doesn't emit any neutrinos; the neutrinos come from the pp-I steps that formed the D's. So each D contributes one neutrino, so two neutrinos per pp-II reaction, each around 420 keV.

Wait, that can't be right because then the pp-II neutrinos would be in the same energy range as the pp-I, which would make the flux from pp-II higher in number but same energy. But that doesn't make sense because the question is about bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So maybe I'm wrong about the energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II reaction emits higher-energy neutrinos because the binding energy is higher. Let me think: the energy released in the pp-II reaction is about 25 MeV (as I calculated earlier), but that's the total. That energy is distributed as kinetic energy of the He-4 and the two protons, plus the energy from the two neutrinos. Wait, no, the neutrinos' energies would be a small fraction of the total energy. So each neutrino's energy would be on the order of 0.4 MeV (like the pp-I), but perhaps there's a tail that goes higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II process contributes neutrinos with higher energies than the pp-I. For example, the neutrinos from pp-II could have energies around 800 keV, while the pp-I neutrinos are around 400 keV.

If that's the case, then the neutrinos from pp-II would fall into the higher energy bands, like 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of fluxes between band 1 (700-800) and band 2 (800-900). So if the pp-II process produces neutrinos that are spread across these bands, perhaps the majority are in the 800 keV range.

If the pp-III process (B-8 decay) produces neutrinos with energies around 3.5 MeV (I remember that the B-8 decay neutrinos are higher energy), which would place them into higher energy bands than the ones we're considering (700-900 keV). So, if the pp-III process stops, the neutrinos from that process (which are in higher energy bands) would drop out.

Wait, but the question is about bands 700-800 and 800-900. So if the B-8 decay neutrinos are around 3.5 MeV, which is much higher than 900 keV, so they're not in these bands. So the flux in these bands is dominated by the pp-I and pp-II processes.

But wait, the pp-I neutrinos are around 420 keV, which is below 700 keV, so they wouldn't contribute to bands 700-800 or 800-900. So the neutrinos in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands come from the pp-II reactions. Because the pp-II produces two neutrinos per reaction, each around 420 keV, but perhaps some have higher energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-II process have a higher energy distribution. Maybe some are in the 700-800 keV range, and some are in higher ranges. But in this case, without pp-III, we still have the pp-I and pp-II processes active.

Wait, but the pp-III process isn't directly contributing to the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands because its neutrinos are at higher energies. So the stopping of pp-III wouldn't affect these bands. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The pp-III process is the decay of B-8 into Li-7, which emits a ν_e with an energy of about 3.5 MeV. So the neutrinos from pp-III are in higher energy bands, so they don't affect bands 700-800 and 800-900. So the flux in these bands comes from pp-I and pp-II.

But wait, the pp-I neutrinos are around 420 keV, which is below 700 keV, so they don't contribute to band 1 or 2. So the flux in bands 1 and 2 must come from the pp-II neutrinos.

If the pp-II process emits neutrinos with energies around 800 keV, let's say, then the flux in band 1 (700-800) would be lower than band 2 (800-900), because most neutrinos are around 800 keV.

Wait, but if the pp-II neutrinos have a spectrum that peaks around 800 keV, then the flux in band 1 (700-800) would be lower than in band 2 (800-900). Wait, no, because the flux is the number per unit area per second per energy. So if the distribution is such that more neutrinos are in band 2 than band 1, then the ratio F1/F2 would be less than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino flux from the pp-II process has a distribution where the number of neutrinos decreases with energy. So higher energies have fewer neutrinos.

Wait, the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos from the pp-II process is such that
