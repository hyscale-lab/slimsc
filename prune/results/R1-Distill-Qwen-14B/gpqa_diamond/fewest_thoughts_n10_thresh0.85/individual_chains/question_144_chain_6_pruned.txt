Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, mean decay distance... Oh right, I remember that the mean decay length is related to how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer it lives, the further it can travel before breaking apart. So the formula should involve the lifetime of the particle.

But how do I get the lifetime from the given data? I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy ΔE, and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time Δt. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait, isn't the width Γ of a resonance actually equal to the inverse of the lifetime? So τ = ħ / Γ. Let me make sure. Yeah, I think that's correct: Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime τ, the mean decay distance is the distance the particle travels during its lifetime. So that would be the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ. So distance L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity v of the meson? For that, I need to consider its energy and mass. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

The total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So I can solve for p: p = sqrt( (E² - (mc²)²) ) / c.

Wait, but units might get tricky here.
