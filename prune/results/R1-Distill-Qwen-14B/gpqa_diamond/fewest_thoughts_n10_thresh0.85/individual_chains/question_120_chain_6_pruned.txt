Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is constant in space. So the number of stars should depend on the volume of space we're considering. But how does parallax come into play here?

Let me think about the volume. For a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Since plx is 1/d, the distance d is 1/plx. So if plx increases, the distance decreases. Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of distance.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell times the thickness. Surface area is 4πd², and thickness is dr. So the number of stars dN is proportional to 4πd² dr. But wait, dr is related to dplx. Let's see, since plx = 1/d, then dplx = - (1/d²) dd. Oh, because differentiating plx = 1/d gives dplx = -1/d² dd. So dd = -d² dplx.

But since we're considering a small change in plx, maybe I should express dN in terms of plx. Substituting d =1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Putting it all together, dN = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/(plx²) dplx ) ). Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me re-calculate. Oh wait, I think I missed the substitution correctly.

Wait, dN = 4π d² dr, where dr is the thickness in distance. But dr = (dd) = (d (1/plx)) ) = (-1/plx²) dplx. So substituting d = 1/plx, dr =
