Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. There are five stars given, and I need to determine which pair can be detected by both instruments.

The key info from the question is:
- ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, the apparent V magnitude should be less than or equal to 17 for them to be observable.
- HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16.

Wait, actually, no. Wait: The way it's phrased is, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Since in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter, so a star brighter than 17 mag (i.e., apparent magnitude <17) is observable by ESPRESSO. Same for HIRES: brighter than 16 mag, so apparent magnitude <16.

So, for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have an apparent V magnitude <=16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16, and ESPRESSO can handle up to 17. So the limiting factor is the HIRES's 16 mag.

Wait, but wait: the question is which stars can be detected with both, so it must satisfy the condition for both instruments. So, the apparent V magnitude must be <=16 mag. Because if a star is at 17 mag, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So for both, it must be <=16.

Wait, no, wait: Because the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 can be observed. So, a star with apparent magnitude 16 is brighter than 17, so yes. So for both, the apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 16.

Wait no: The way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, if a star's V is less than 17, it's observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES
