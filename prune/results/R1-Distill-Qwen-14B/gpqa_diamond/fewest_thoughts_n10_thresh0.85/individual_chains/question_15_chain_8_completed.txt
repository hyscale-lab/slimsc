Okay, so I have this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me a lot of data, so I need to break it down carefully.

Alright, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers have limited time and want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. 

The stars are interesting. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius, which is a bit surprising because I thought more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe Planet_2's host is a bit evolved, so it might be similar in radius. So, same radius but different masses.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else? Or wait, the main factor is the alignment of the orbit. The probability is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on relative to us.

Wait, yes, the transit probability (P) is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p * sin i)), but I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, another approach is that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(a_p)) * something else. Wait, no, I think the formula for the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by 1/a_p, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, no, maybe more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p)) ), or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the reciprocal of the semi-major axis. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, the transit probability equation is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e^2))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, that's not the whole story. Because the transit probability also depends on the planet's orbital parameters—specifically, the inclination of the orbit. 

Wait, no, another way: the probability that a randomly oriented orbit will cause a transit is about (R_p + R_s) / a_p, but I'm not so sure. Maybe that's an approximation. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / (R_s + R_p)) )^2 multiplied by something else? I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula. The probability that a planet transits its star is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e^2))) ) * (1 / (a_p (1 - (R_p + R_s)/a_p )) )

Wait, no. Let's look it up in my memory. The transit probability is actually dependent on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p)) ) multiplied by some geometric factors.

Wait, I think I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by 1/(a_p). But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the actual probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p)) ) but only when a_p is much larger than R_p and R_s.

Alternatively, another approach: the probability of a transit is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the sphere's cross-section where the planet can be. But I'm not recalling exactly.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. The main factors affecting the transit probability are:

1. The size of the planet relative to the star (R_p / R_s) — larger planets or smaller stars increase the probability.
2. The orbital distance (a_p) — closer planets have a higher chance because the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on when the planet is closer. Or is it the opposite? Wait, no, actually, the transit probability increases with shorter orbital periods because they have smaller semi-major axes. Wait, no. Because the probability depends on the alignment. So if a planet is in a highly inclined orbit, it will transit regardless of distance. But the likelihood that the orbit is aligned edge-on depends on the system's orientation, which is random, so for all other things being equal, planets orbiting closer have a higher probability? Or not necessarily.

Wait, wait, the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p)) * (1/(1 - (R_p + R_s)/a_p)) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, another formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(a_p^2 - R_s^2))) ), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p)) ) * (1 / sin i),

where i is the inclination. But since the inclination is a random variable, the average probability is when you integrate over all possible inclinations. The probability that i is within the range that causes transit is approximately (R_p + R_s) / a_p. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, another thought: the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbit is edge-on enough for the transit to occur. The edge-on condition is when the inclination i is close to 90 degrees. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will cause a transit is approximately (R_p + R_s) / a_p. Wait, is that right?

Wait, for a circular orbit, the probability that the planet transits is approximately (R_p + R_s) / a_p. But I think that's the condition for the planet's orbit to be aligned in such a way that the transit occurs. Because the transit occurs when the planet's orbital path is across the line of sight, which is a specific orientation.

Wait, no, I think the correct average transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_p) )? Or maybe (R_p / (R_s + R_p))^2 multiplied by (1/a_p).

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. But since I can't do that, I'll try to think it through. The transit occurs when the planet moves directly in front of the star from our point of view. The chance of this happening depends on how likely the orbital plane is aligned edge-on.

The probability of a transit is given by the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius over the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, that's for the condition where the planet's orbit is exactly edge-on. So the probability is  (R_p + R_s) / a_p. Because if the semi-major axis is a_p, and the planet's orbital plane is tilted by an angle i from our line of sight, the condition for transit is that the distance from the star's center to the planet's orbital plane (projected) is less than (R_p + R_s). So the probability is (R_p + R_s) divided by the semi-major axis.

Wait, but that can't be right because (R_p + R_s) is much smaller than a_p for planets. So that would make the probability low, which aligns with reality. So the transit probability is (R_p + R_s)/a_p. Wait, no, that's the condition for the transit possibility, but the actual probability would be the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned within that condition.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p)) * (some geometric factor). Alternatively, maybe the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p)).

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's position would cause a transit to the total possible area. Wait, but that's for the orbital plane.

I think I'm getting stuck on the exact formula, but perhaps I can approach the problem using the key factors given.

So, given that both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host star masses.

The key variables for transit probability are:

1. (R_p / R_s)^2: Since both planets are Earth-like, R_p is the same. But the host stars have the same radius, R_s is same for both. So (R_p/R_s)^2 is the same for both planets.

Wait, wait, the question states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_s is same for Planet_1 and Planet_2. Since the planets are Earth-like, their radii R_p is same for both.

So (R_p/R_s)^2 is the same for both. So that factor doesn't affect the choice between Planet_1 and Planet_2. So the other factors must determine which has a higher probability.

The other factor is the orbital distance. The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (a_p) of the planet. Because the probability is (R_p + R_s)/a_p. Wait, but if the formula is (R_p + R_s)/a_p, then the probability is inversely proportional to a_p.

Wait, but let me get this straight. If the semi-major axis is larger, the probability of transit is lower, because the planet is farther away and the chance of alignment is less. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, if a_p is larger, the denominator is larger, so (R_p + R_s)/a_p is smaller. So the probability is lower when a_p is larger. So for a planet with a larger semi-major axis, the probability is lower.

But in this case, the question says that Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Since both planets are around stars of different masses, but same radius, perhaps we can find their semi-major axes.

Because from Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the mass of the star M. The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M + m)) a^3. Since the planets are Earth-like, their masses are much smaller than the stars, so M + m ≈ M.

So for each planet, the semi-major axis a is proportional to (P² M)^(1/3). Because Kepler's third law in this form is a^3 ∝ (P^2 M), so a = ( (G(M) P^2 ) / (4π²) )^(1/3) )

But since M is different for each star, and P is different as well.

For Planet_1: P1 = (1/3) P2. Because Planet_1 has three times shorter orbital period than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 / 3.

Mass of host star for Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 = [ ( (G * M1) * P1^2 ) / (4π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ ( (G * M2) * P2^2 ) / (4π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me plug in the values.

a1 = [ (G * 2 M2) * ( (P2/3) )^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) / (4π²)^(1/3 )

Which simplifies to [ (2 M2) * (P2² /9) ) ]^(1/3 ) / ... 

So a1 = [ (2/9) M2 P2² ) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 = [ (M2) P2² ) ]^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ (2/9 ) / 1 ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3 )

Let me compute 2/9 = approx 0.222.

The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, since 0.6^3 is 0.216.

So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So Planet_1's semi-major axis is about 0.6 times that of Planet_2. So a1 is smaller.

Wait, because P1 is shorter, and M1 is higher, a1 is smaller than a2.

So now, transit probability is proportional to (R_p + R_s)/a_p.

But as R_p and R_s are same for both, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a_p.

Wait, but if a1 is smaller than a2, then (R_p + R_s)/a1 is larger than (R_p + R_s)/a2. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

But wait, earlier I thought the transit probability was (R_p + R_s)/a_p. So if a1 is smaller, then (R_p + R_s)/a1 is larger, meaning higher probability.

So Planet_1 has a higher a_p denominator, but wait no: a1 is smaller, so 1/a1 is larger, making the transit probability higher.

Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2.

Wait, but the question is about which planet the researchers should observe. They want the one with higher probability.

So if Planet_1 has higher probability, then the correct answer would be either options C or D. Let's see.

Wait, but what about other factors? Because the formula I'm using, (R_p + R_s)/a_p, might not be the exact one. Oh wait, perhaps the exact formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_p). So because (R_p/R_s)^2 is same for both, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a_p.

So because a1 is smaller than a2, 1/a1 is larger. So (1/a1) = (a2/(a1 a2)) ) = (a2/(0.6 a2)) ) = 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.666 times larger.

So transit probability for Planet_1 is (1/a1) ≈ 1.666 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, because a1 = 0.6 a2:

1/a1 = 1/(0.6 a2) ) = (1/a2) * (1/0.6) ≈ 1.6667 * (1/a2)

So Planet_1's transit probability is approximately 1.6667 times that of Planet_2.

So which is higher? Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times higher. Hmm. How did I get 1.666 times?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the a1/a2 calculation.

Let me re-calculate a1 and a2.

For Planet_1: a1^3 ∝ M1 * P1².

M1=2 M2, P1= P2/3.

So a1^3 = 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 = 2 M2 * P2² /9.

For Planet_2: a2^3 = M2 * P2².

So a1^3/a2^3 = (2/9) M2 P2² / (M2 P2²) ) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = cube root(2/9) = (approx) 0.6.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

Therefore, transit probability is proportional to 1/a_p.

So Planet_1's probability is (1/a1) = 1/(0.6 a2) = (1/a2) * (5/3) ≈ 1.6667 times Planet_2's probability.

So the ratio is about 1.666, so about 1.65 times, which is option C.

So option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct answer would be C.


To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transit Probability Formula**: The transit probability is proportional to  
   \[
   P \propto \frac{R_p}{R_s} \cdot \frac{1}{a_p}
   \]  
   where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a_p\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like and their host stars have the same radius (\(R_p / R_s\) is constant), the probability depends inversely on \(a_p\).

2. **Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis**: Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a_p\) is related to the orbital period \(P\) and the host star's mass \(M_s\) by:  
   \[
   a_p^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2
   \]  
   For Planet_1:  
   - Orbital period \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) (three times shorter than Planet_2).  
   - Host star mass \(M_{s1} = 2 \cdot M_{s2}\).  

   Substituting these values:  
   \[
   a_1^3 \propto 2 \cdot M_{s2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9} \cdot M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2
   \]  
   For Planet_2:  
   \[
   a_2^3 \propto M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2
   \]  
   Taking the ratio of \(a_1^3 / a_2^3\):  
   \[
   \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{\frac{2}{9} \cdot M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2}{M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
   \]  
   Therefore:  
   \[
   \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{9}} \approx 0.6
   \]  
   This means \(a_1 \approx 0.6 \cdot a_2\).

3. **Transit Probability Ratio**: Since transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a_p\), the ratio of the transit probabilities is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1/a_1}{1/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
   \]  
   Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

4. **Conclusion**: Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller semi-major axis (\(a_1 < a_2\)). The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Answer: C**
