Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and they have negligible mass. Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the potential energy in an electric system is related to the configuration of charges. Since the system is isolated, I probably don't have to worry about external fields or anything like that.

Wait, the minimum energy... Oh, right, in systems with charges, the potential energy depends on how the charges are arranged. But wait, in this case, 12 charges are at a fixed distance from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the setup is that 12 charges are each at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, but point P has the 13th charge. So the 12 charges are all at the same distance r=2 m from P. So each of these 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge.

I'm trying to figure out the potential energy here. Potential energy for a system of charges is the work done to bring each charge into its position from infinity, considering the potential due to all other charges.

Wait, but since the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P, maybe we can model this as
