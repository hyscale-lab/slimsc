Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice, right?

The problem gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between neighboring atoms, which in a crystal is the lattice parameter 'a'. So maybe 'a' is 10 Angstroms here. Also, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh, right, in a rhombohedral crystal system, all the edges are of equal length (a = b = c), and all angles are the same. So this is a primitive rhombohedral system.

I remember the formula for interplanar distance (d) is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) ), but wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, isn't there a simplified formula when the crystal is rhombohedral?

Wait, in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But rhombohedral isn't cubic, so we need to account for the angles. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/(a²) ) + (k²/(b²)) + (l²/(c²)) - (2hk cos beta)/(ab) - (2hl cos gamma)/(ac) - (2kl cos alpha)/(bc) ) ), but that's the inverse. Wait, no, the formula I think is:

d = [ (a² + b² + c² - 2ab cos gamma - 2ac cos beta - 2bc cos alpha ) ]^{-1/2} }
Wait, no, that seems off. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice or the metric tensor. Oh, another approach: The interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula from the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) ) when a = b = c and all angles are same. Wait, no, that can't be right because the formula for a general case is more complicated.

Wait, I think the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ). But wait, in rhombohedral, all a,
