Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about titration, specifically with acetic acid and NaOH. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing a solution by adding a base or acid until it reaches equivalence. But wait, let me think through this step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh right, diluting it by half because the volumes are equal. So the concentration will drop. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I need to figure out what the diluted concentration of acetic acid is. The initial volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, Molarity is moles per liter. So moles of acetic acid initially would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. Diluting to 40 cm³ (0.04 L) gives 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, for the titration part. The NaOH is 0.1 M. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So, initial moles of acetic acid = 0.001. Moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration, so 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, 25% of what? 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted. So let's figure out the concentrations here. The initial diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. When 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (0.1 M) is added, the moles of NaOH are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), the moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and the moles of CH3COO^- will increase by the same amount.

So, let's calculate the concentrations in the solution. The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

The initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Moles after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

So the concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since we're dealing with a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(Ka). The Ka given is 1.85e-5. Let's calculate pKa: log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.74 (since log(1.85) is ~0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733).

So pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.263. Rounded, that's around 4.26.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Hmm, 0.00075 / 0.0425 is 0.00075 divided by 0.0425. Let me compute that: 0.00075 / 0.0425
