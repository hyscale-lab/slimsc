Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a complexing agent, so it binds with ions like calcium. The pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its deprotonated form and can form complexes efficiently. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think I need to adjust for that.

The given K value is 5x10^10. Wait, what's K here? Oh right, K is the formation constant for the complex. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex, so the reaction tends to go to the product side.

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So, the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex, which is dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. The complex is [CaEDTA]^2-, I think, because EDTA is usually in the fourth negative charge state when complexed. But wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the reaction is: [CaEDTA]^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The formation constant K is given by K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4- ] / [ [CaEDTA]^2- ].

But wait, K is the formation constant, which is the reverse of the dissociation. So K for the complex formation is the same as the dissociation K but inverted. Let me think again. Formation constant is for the formation of the complex from the ions. So, Kf = [ [CaEDTA]^2- ] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). So if I have the Kf, then the dissociation would have Kd = 1/Kf.

In this problem, they've given K as 5e10. I think they mean Kf is 5e10. So the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/(5e10) =
