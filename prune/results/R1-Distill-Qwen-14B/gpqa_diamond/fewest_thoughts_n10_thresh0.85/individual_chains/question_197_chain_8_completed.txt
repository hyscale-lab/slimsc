Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and start breaking it down.

The question is about identifying the product of a reaction involving Compound X. The reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, maybe it's more about the formation of amines from imines? Or perhaps I'm confusing it with another reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the hydrolysis of an alkyne? Or maybe it's the dehydrohalogenation or something else. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Oh right, I think when a nitrile reacts with H2O and HgSO4 or something like that, but wait, red phosphorus and HI is a different setup. Oh, wait, maybe it's the Stephen reduction? Or perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an alkyne with those reagents. Alternatively, HI and red phosphorus could be used for dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI might be used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings under specific conditions. Alternatively, I recall that in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can function as a source of H+ and I- ions, perhaps for some elimination or substitution reactions.

But let me focus on the data given first. Let's look at the IR and NMR spectra of Compound X because that should help me figure out what the structure is before the reaction. Once I know Compound X, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, likely indicating O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, the strong peak around 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, the compound probably has a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or a ketone, and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, and broad could imply exchange, but maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. But wait, in the IR, if there's a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone or ester. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a broad O-H around 2500-3300, which the IR does show. So maybe the 10.5 is the O-H stretch in the NMR. No, wait, O-H in NMR is a broad peak, usually. But this is a singlet at 10.5, which is more like an aldehyde, but wait, aldehydes also have a strong absorption around 2800-2700 cm-1 in the IR, which is in the 3400-2500 range given here. But the IR also shows a strong peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl, maybe an ester (around 1730-1760 for esters) or a ketone (around 1700-1750). Wait, but if the IR has a peak at 1720, then it's a carbonyl.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5, which is a singlet. If it's an aldehyde, would that make sense? Aldehydes have a strong peak around 9-10 ppm. But considering that in the IR, the 3400-2500 region would show the aldehyde C-H stretch as well as any O-H. So maybe this is an aldehyde. Hmm.

But wait, let me think again. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. If it were a ketone, the O-H wouldn't be present, but the IR shows the broad region which might include an O-H stretch. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the O-H could be from something else, but in that case, maybe the ester's carbonyl is at 1720.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which is more indicative of an aldehyde. So perhaps the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with a carbonyl group elsewhere, but that seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 is an acidic proton, like a phenolic O-H, but phenols are usually broader and around 5-7 ppm. Wait, no, when phenol is deprotonated, in certain conditions, but in DMSO, for example, the phenol O-H can appear around 10 ppm. So maybe that's the case here.

Wait, but if the compound has a phenol group, then the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 3300-2500, which it does. The 1720 cm-1 could then be a ketone or an ester. Hmm, but in that case, the singlet at 10.5 is a phenolic O-H. But let's see the other NMR signals.

Looking at the rest of the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is likely a pair of aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene ring. The d (doublet) suggests coupling with one adjacent proton. Wait, if it's para-substituted, each proton would have two adjacent protons, but maybe in a meta or ortho substitution.

Wait, another peak at 7.2 ppm, also a d (2H). So perhaps we have a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, if there are two substituents para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two different groups, each substituent would have two protons on adjacent carbons, leading to doublets. Alternatively, if it's a meta substitution, that might lead to different splitting.

Wait, but looking at the integration, it's 2H each. So for a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other (para), the ring would have two sets of two protons each, each set as doublets. So that would fit. So maybe the benzene ring has substituents in the para positions, and each substituent is causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

So, if the substituents are in para positions, that would lead to two doublets in the aromatic region. The higher ppm (8.0) suggests more deshielded protons, which could be next to an electron-withdrawing group.

The other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like next to an oxygen or near a carbonyl. Or perhaps a CH in a branched chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, perhaps part of a chain, like a -CH2- group adjacent to a branching point.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet with three protons, which suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH. So perhaps a -CH(CH3)- group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, which is likely a terminal CH3 group, probably in a longer chain, such as an ethyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, a side chain with a branching point, and perhaps a carbonyl group.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is likely a carbonyl. If that's an ester, then the structure would have an ester group. Alternatively, it's a ketone or an aldehyde. But in the NMR, I don't see a strong peak that would suggest an aldehyde, unless the 10.5 ppm is the aldehyde proton, but usually aldehydes have a strong peak around 9-10 ppm, but singlet. Wait, but the 10.5 is a broad singlet, which could also be an O-H from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if the IR shows a 1720 cm-1, which is more like a ketone (maybe around 1700-1750), but wait, 1720 is closer to an ester. Let me think: esters are around 1725-1740 cm-1, so 1720 would fit. Then, a peak around 10.5 ppm would be an aldehyde, but that doesn't fit with an ester. Or, perhaps it's a carbonyl of an acid, but then 1720 is higher than typical for a carboxylic acid (which is usually around 1700 but can vary). Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 2500-3300 cm-1, which the IR shows, and a carbonyl around 1700. So maybe 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid derivative.

Hmm, perhaps I need to draw this out mentally. Let's think about the NMR data again.

The aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. Let's say substituents at positions 1 and 3? No, that would be meta. If substituents are at 1 and 4 (para), then the ring would have two sets of two protons each. For example, let's say substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Then, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent, but wait, no, that would be meta. Hmm, maybe substituents are at 2 and 5, but that's also para. Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 4 and 1, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and there's another substituent at position 1. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, each for 2H, so maybe two substituents in positions that cause each set of two protons to be equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in positions 4 and 1, but that might not result in two doublets. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, but that would make three substituent positions? No, the question says it's para, meaning two substituents opposite each other.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and another substituent is part of a side chain. Or maybe it's a single substituent in the para position, like an ethyl group or a propyl group.

Wait, the side chain in the NMR: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggests a CH that's connected to something else. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a branching point. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3 in an ethyl group.

So putting that together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a side chain. Let's say the substituent is at position 4, and the side chain is something like CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So that would be like a CH(CH3) group. Then, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is the CH in the middle. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 adjacent to that CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) indicates a terminal ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me think. The substituent would be a group attached to the benzene ring. Let me see: the substituent chain would be something like CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's a tert-butyl group. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. Or wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's try drawing this. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. Let's say the substituent is a propyl chain with a branch. So the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. But then, that would be a sec-butyl group if the branching is on the second carbon. So the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that only has two carbons. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me try to map the NMR.

- Starting from the benzene ring, which has substituents. Let's assume one substituent is a side chain, and another substituent is something else.

Wait, but the aromatic region is two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents, each in the para position. So substituents at positions 1 and 3? No, that's meta. Wait, substituents at positions 1 and 4 would be para. So substituents in para positions, and each substituent is causing the adjacent aromatic protons to split into a doublet.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are both at the same position, but that would lead to a different splitting pattern.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a single group in the para position that's a side chain, and another substituent elsewhere, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has a substituent that's a ketone or ester or aldehyde. Wait, but the IR and NMR data suggest a carbonyl elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an alkoxy group, but the NMR doesn't show the typical triplet for an OCH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, but that would show up differently.

Wait, let me think again about the IR. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. The 1610 and 1450 peaks are likely aromatic C=C stretches. The 3400-2500 region includes the broad O-H stretch, which could be from a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring, a side chain with a carbonyl group, and a carboxylic acid group.

But then, in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm would be the O-H of the carboxylic acid. The 1720 would then be the carbonyl of the acid, but carboxylic acids typically have their carbonyl around 1700. So 1720 might be more like an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. Wait, but the 10.5 is a singlet, and aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, so that could fit. But then, the IR would have a strong peak for the aldehyde C-H stretch around 2800 cm-1, which is in the given IR data.

But then, the 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl. An aldehyde would have a peak around 1700, but perhaps that's stretching it. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Wait, but the NMR data has a 10.5 ppm singlet, which could be an aldehyde proton. Let me imagine that. So the benzene ring has an aldehyde substituent. Then, perhaps another substituent with a carbonyl group, but that doesn't make sense because a benzaldehyde wouldn't have a carbonyl elsewhere unless it's an ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group. So for example, a phenyl ester.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show the typical ester groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzoyl group.

Alternatively, considering the side chain: the substituent is a longer chain with a carbonyl group. For example, maybe it's a benzene ring with a propyl group that ends with a carbonyl, like a ketone. But then the carbonyl would be around 1700, which is close to 1720.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a propyl ketone substituent. So, something like CH2CH2C(O)R attached to the ring. But how does that fit with the NMR?

Wait, the NMR shows a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be the CH next to the carbonyl. Then, the 1.7 (m, 2H) could be the CH2 next to that, and the 1.4 (d, 3H) could be a CH3 attached to the CH. Hmm, that could form a structure like:

Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)2?

Wait, no, that doesn't quite fit. Let me think about the substituent chain.

Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. So, perhaps a sec-butyl group attached to the ring, with a carbonyl at the end. So, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)2? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a carbonyl in the middle. So, Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. But then, the NMR would show the CH2 next to the carbonyl as a triplet or quartet.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone. For example, a propiophenone derivative. Let me imagine the structure as Ph-CH2-C(O)-R. But the NMR data suggests a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, leading to a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me try to reconstruct the substituent based on the NMR.

The substituent has a structure where:

- There's a CH3 group attached to a CH (the 1.4 ppm, d, 3H).
- That CH is next to a CH2 group (the 1.7 ppm, m, 2H).
- The CH2 is next to a CH that's adjacent to the benzene ring (the 2.9 ppm, m, 1H).
- And then, perhaps, a terminal CH3 (the 0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

Wait, that would imply a structure like this: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene ring? No, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a pentyl group with a branch. Let me think: if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-pentyl group. Let me count the carbons.

Wait, the substituent is a chain that starts with the benzene ring. So, benzene connected to CH2, then to CH, then to another CH2, and then to a CH3. Hmm, but the NMR doesn't show a triplet at 0.9 ppm for a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, another approach: the 0.9 ppm triplet implies a terminal CH3. So that's a CH2CH3 group somewhere. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (2H) is a CH2, and the 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH.

So, the substituent might be a branching of CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't quite fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch. Let's imagine the substituent as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene ring. But then, looking at the NMR:

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have the CH at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The adjacent CH2 groups would have protons at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at around 1.4 ppm? No, wait, the CH3 would be attached to CH, so perhaps it's a doublet.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which would correspond to a CH3 attached to a CH. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

If the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, then the CH2 at the end (CH2CH3) would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm. The CH(CH3) would have a CH with neighboring CH2 groups, possibly appearing as a multiplet at 2.9 ppm. The middle CH2 groups would appear as multiplets at 1.7 ppm.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's think: the substituent could be CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, that's a tert-butyl group? No, wait, that's a pentyl group. Wait, no, a butyl group is four carbons. So, substituent: benzene ring attached to CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a benzene ring, with a branch. So, substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CH2... but that would be four carbons, making it a butyl group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try to think of the possible options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the question is about the product of reacting Compound X with red phosphorus and HI. So once I figure out what Compound X is, I can determine what happens in the reaction.

Looking at the options, some are benzoic acids (C), others are substituted benzene rings (B, D), or a propanoic acid (A).

But let's get back to the NMR and IR to find out what Compound X is.

The IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, which could be an ester, ketone, or acid. The broad peak in IR (3400–2500 cm-1) suggests O-H or N-H. The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm (singlet), which is likely an O-H (as in a carboxylic acid) or an aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: if the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, and the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is an O-H, then perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. For example, benzoic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700 and an O-H around 10 ppm. But the 1720 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzoic acid.

But then, looking at the substituent on the benzene ring, the NMR has two doublets in the aromatic region, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, the substituent is in the para position, and the benzoic acid group is attached elsewhere.

Wait, but if the substituent is a side chain, perhaps the structure is something like 4-(substituent)benzoic acid. Let's say the benzoic acid is attached at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4, leading to para substitution.

So, the substituent would be a side chain attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the NMR data for the side chain:

- The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH adjacent to the benzene ring.

- The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group next to a branching point.

- The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH.

- The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3.

Putting this together, the substituent would be a propyl group with a branch, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is actually (CH2)2CHCH2-. Hmm, no, wait. Let me recall: a butyl group can be straight-chain (n-butyl), iso-butyl (CH(CH2CH3)2), or sec-butyl (CH2CH(CH2CH3)-). Wait, no, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t), which suggests that the substituent ends with a CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent would be something like CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group leading to a terminal CH3. So, structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that would be a pentyl group, perhaps as a substituent.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene would be a propyl group with a branch, meaning a sec-propyl group? No, that's not a standard term. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)-, but that's two carbons. No, actually, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's a longer chain. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle carbon is attached to a CH3 and a CH2CH3. Hmm, that would be a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which would be a tert-butyl group. But then, the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups attached to the central carbon. But in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which would be a pentyl group with a branch. Let me see how that would split the NMR:

- The CH2 next to the benzene ring would be a triplet if adjacent to another CH2, but in this case, it's next to a CH group, which is more complex.

- The CH group (CH(CH3)) would be a multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 groups would appear as multiplets at 1.7 and 1.4 ppm.

- The terminal CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

This seems to fit the NMR data.

So, if the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch, perhaps a 3-pentyl group, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me think about that structure.

Benzoic acid has a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group at the para position, the structure would be:

Phenyl ring with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4.

What's the structure of a sec-butyl group? It's CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait, no. Actually, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Wait, no, a butyl group can be n-, iso-, sec-, tert-. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)-, but that's only three carbons. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH3)-, but that's only two carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, making it a sec-propyl group. But that's not a standard term.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch in the middle. So, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction conditions.

Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. From what I remember, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Wait, but if Compound X is a nitrile, then upon hydrolysis, it would form an amine. Alternatively, if X is an alkyne, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might lead to a diiodide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amine. For example, RCN + HI, red P → RCH2NH2. But that's a primary amine. Alternatively, maybe it's a partial reduction.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact reaction. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the presence of a nitrile to form an amine. For example, the Stephen reduction: nitriles are reduced to amines using H2 in the presence of a catalyst, but that's different. Alternatively, HI and red phosphorus can lead to the formation of an amine via a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Wait, nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions (like with H2O and HgSO4) produces a carboxylic acid, but with red phosphorus and HI, maybe it's a different pathway, like forming an imidamide or a different intermediate.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents are used to reduce an alkyne to a trans-alkene. Wait, the reaction of alkynes with red phosphorus and HI typically produces a trans-dihalide. For example, an alkyne plus HI and red phosphorus gives vicinal diiodide.

But wait, if Compound X is an alkyne, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would produce a diiodide, which upon elimination would form an alkene. Hmm, but the question is about the final product, so perhaps the diiodide is the product, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation or some kind of addition.

Wait, but another thought: if Compound X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent, then upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into something else. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of a triple bond to form a trans-dihalide.

Wait, but without knowing Compound X's structure, it's hard to predict the product. So, let's go back to figuring out Compound X.

The NMR data suggests a benzene ring with two substituents, each causing two protons to split into doublets. The substituent attached to the ring has a side chain that includes a CH(CH3) group, a CH2, and a terminal CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which is a pentyl group with a branch.

Putting this together, the substituent would be a 3-pentyl group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, leading to a structure like CH2CH(CH3)CH2.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR is a singlet integrating to 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure is a benzoic acid derivative. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a substituent in the para position.

So, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, leading to a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's option C.

So, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, but benzoic acid reacting with HI and red phosphorus. Hmm, what's the reaction pathway here?

Benzoic acid has a carbonyl group. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for hydrolysis of nitriles. But if the starting material is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. But benzoic acid is a meta-directing group, so maybe the substituent could be substituted.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is already in the para position relative to the COOH group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol or something else. But benzoic acid typically doesn't reduce easily under those conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation, but that usually requires heat.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the acid group but on the substituent. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is an alkyl chain, then perhaps the reaction is a substitution or elimination.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the reaction conditions here. Let me think again: red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. So, if Compound X were a nitrile, the product would be an amine.

But in this case, the NMR and IR data suggest a benzoic acid. So, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a hydrolysis of an ester. But the benzoic acid is already the acid form, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzoic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus to form an acid chloride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If that's the structure of Compound X, then what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Another thought: maybe the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester group, but I don't see an ester in Compound X.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group. But the NMR doesn't show a nitrile's typical signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone. If the substituent is a ketone, then the reaction could involve some kind of reduction.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show the typical peaks for a ketone's CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a triple bond, making it an alkyne. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would add HI across the triple bond to form a trans-dihalide.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

If the substituent is a propargyl group (alkyne), then upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it would form a vicinal diiodide. But I don't see the peaks in the NMR that would suggest an alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group or something else, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction leading to one of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If that's the starting material, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI—what would that do?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but again, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is a nitrile group. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze the nitrile to an amine. For example, if the substituent is a nitrile, the product would be an amine attached to the benzene ring.

But in the NMR data, I don't see the typical signals for a nitrile, which would be a strong peak around 2200 cm-1 in the IR, which isn't present here. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

Compound X has:

- A benzene ring with two substituents, leading to two doublets in the aromatic region (para substitution).

- A substituent that's a chain with a CH(CH3), CH2, and CH2CH3 groups.

- A carbonyl group (likely an ester or ketone) at 1720 cm-1.

- A broad peak at 10.5 ppm, likely an O-H (carboxylic acid).

Putting this together, the substituent is a side chain attached to the benzene ring, which has a carboxylic acid group.

So, the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid.

The substituent's NMR suggests a CH(CH3) group, so perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Therefore, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is an alkyl chain, perhaps the reaction is an elimination or substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. But if X is a benzoic acid, it's already the acid form. So maybe the reaction doesn't change the substituent but does something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the carbonyl group into something else. But if the starting material is a benzoic acid, the carbonyl is already a COOH group, and I don't see how HI and red phosphorus would change that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a good leaving group, HI could substitute it. But the substituent here is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a leaving group.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the reaction doesn't change the substituent but affects the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the benzoic acid is converted into benzyl alcohol. But under what conditions? Reduction with H2 and a catalyst would do that, but HI and red phosphorus don't usually do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzoic acid is decarboxylated, but that usually requires higher temperatures or other conditions.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the initial structure. Let me revisit the NMR data.

The substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): CH

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): CH2

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): CH3 attached to CH

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): CH2CH3

This suggests a structure like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that can't be right because that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is a butyl group.

Wait, the substituent chain would be:

Benzene ring → CH2 → CH(CH3) → CH2 → CH2CH3.

So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch at the second carbon (CH(CH3)).

Wait, that would make the substituent a 3-pentyl group, which is a butyl group with a methyl branch.

But I'm not sure what the product would be in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but with a branching that makes it a sec-propyl group.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress. Given the options, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is the structure of Compound X. But then, what's the product after reacting with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, but since the starting material is already a benzoic acid, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring, but I don't see a leaving group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is a methyl ester, and the reaction is hydrolyzing it to a carboxylic acid. But the NMR doesn't show the ester's typical signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent includes a carbonyl group, like an ester or ketone, which reacts with HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl ketone. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to some kind of substitution.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that usually requires Mg, not red phosphorus.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group to an alcohol. For example, using HI and red phosphorus as a reducing agent.

Wait, I think I remember that red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce carbonyl groups. For example, in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols.

So, if Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a carboxylic acid group (which is a carbonyl), then the reaction would reduce the ketone (if present) to an alcohol. But wait, benzoic acid has a carboxylic acid group, which is a stronger carbonyl. Would HI and red phosphorus reduce that?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the COOH group but on another carbonyl group in the substituent.

Wait, if the substituent is a propyl ketone group, then the reaction would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.

But in this case, the substituent doesn't have a carbonyl group. Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, which would correspond to the benzoic acid's COOH group.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I'm not certain about the exact reaction, but perhaps the benzoic acid is converted into an acid chloride, but I don't see the necessary conditions for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an amine from a nitrile, but the starting material isn't a nitrile.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the substituent. Maybe the substituent is an ester group, and the reaction is hydrolyzing it to a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the initial compound would be an ester, and the product would be the acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it into an amine.

But earlier analysis suggests the structure is a benzoic acid with a substituent, so perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into benzyl amine. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a methyl ester to a carboxylic acid, but again, the initial data doesn't suggest an ester.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but I think the initial structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not on the substituent but on the COOH group. For example, converting the COOH into an amine. But I'm not sure how that would happen with these reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzoic acid is being protected or modified in some way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid iodide. Benzoic acid can react with HI to form benzoyl iodide. But I'm not sure about the role of red phosphorus here.

Wait, HI can act as a source of iodide ions. Red phosphorus might catalyze the reaction. So, perhaps benzoic acid reacts with excess HI to form benzoyl iodide (C6H5COI).

But the question states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then reacting with HI would form 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide.

But looking at the options, none of them are benzoyl iodides. So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. For example, if the substituent is a good leaving group, HI could substitute it. But the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which isn't a leaving group.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, but I think the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent, and the product remains the same. But that can't be, as the question asks for the product.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining Compound X. Let me think again.

Another approach: the 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group.

Putting this together, the substituent is a butyl group. Let's see: the substituent starts with a CH2 attached to the benzene ring, then a CH group (the 2.9 ppm peak), which is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm), which is connected to a CH(CH3) group (the 1.4 ppm peak), and then a terminal CH2CH3 group (0.9 ppm, t).

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch. But perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle carbon is attached to a CH3 and a CH2CH3.

Wait, that would be a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene ring. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch on the middle carbon, making it a sec-propyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is a four-carbon group with a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, an iso-butyl group is (CH3)2CHCH2-, but that would give a different NMR pattern.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, but I'll proceed with what I have.

Assuming Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would likely reduce the carbonyl group. But benzoic acid's carbonyl is in the COOH group, which is less reactive than a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the COOH group but on the substituent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent has a ketone group. So, the structure would be 4-(something with a ketone)benzoic acid. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would reduce the ketone to an alcohol.

But in that case, the substituent would be a propyl ketone, for example.

So, if the substituent is CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, then the NMR would show a CH2 next to the carbonyl as a quartet, which doesn't fit. So, I'm not sure.

In the end, I think the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the structure, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the benzoic acid into benzyl alcohol, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine, but the initial structure doesn't have a nitrile.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess. Given the NMR and IR data, the structure of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI doesn't change the substituent but perhaps does something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution or a reduction.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to determine its structure.

### IR and NMR Analysis of Compound X:
1. **IR Data**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H or N-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
   - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a benzene ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an O-H proton from a carboxylic acid.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH₂ group.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely from a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl chain.

### Structure of Compound X:
- The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure includes:
  - A para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.
  - The sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-) explains the NMR signals for the CH, CH₂, and CH₃ groups.
  - The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the O-H proton of the carboxylic acid.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
- Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines or the reduction of alkynes to trans-dihalides. However, since Compound X is a benzoic acid, the reaction conditions do not suggest a nitrile or alkyne functional group.
- The reaction likely does not alter the carboxylic acid group or the sec-butyl substituent. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (option C), and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not change its structure.
