Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix and its geometrical position in qubit space. Let me see.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So this matrix must represent a mixed state, not a pure state.

Wait, pure states have density matrices like |ψ><ψ|, right? But here, it's a combination of |0> and |1> states. Oh, right, this looks like a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because the density matrix is a mixture of the two basis states with equal weights (each 1/2).

Now the question asks about its geometrical position. I think this relates to how the density matrix is represented in terms of the Bloch sphere. Oh wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |θ, φ>, the Bloch vector is (θ, φ), but for mixed states, it's a bit different. Oh wait, no, actually, for a single qubit, any state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But wait, what about mixed states?

Wait, density matrices can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector with magnitude ≤1. So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. |0> is the vector [1; 0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, we get ρ = (I)/2.

So ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2, since the I is the identity matrix, which is (I + 0 ) /2. Therefore, the vector r must be (0,0,0). Because in the expression r·σ, r would be all zeros.

So the Bloch vector r is at the origin. That would mean the state is completely mixed, which makes sense because for a single qubit, the completely mixed state is (I)/2, which has no direction on the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector with magnitude \(\leq 1\). Expanding the given \(\rho\), we find:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices. Therefore, the Bloch vector is at the origin, corresponding to the completely mixed state. Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**

Answer: C
