Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, both stars have the same peak wavelength. The radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. They assume both stars radiate as black bodies. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm. So I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

Since both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but the problem also mentions radial velocities. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, right? So, the measured wavelengths (the ones observed) could be different from the actual emitted wavelengths. But the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. Oh wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me check.

No, the problem says they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_max_observed is the same for both. But how does that affect the actual temperature?

Wait, but the Doppler shift would change the observed wavelength. So, if Star_1 is moving towards us with radial velocity v, and Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, their observed λ_max would shift. But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same. So let
