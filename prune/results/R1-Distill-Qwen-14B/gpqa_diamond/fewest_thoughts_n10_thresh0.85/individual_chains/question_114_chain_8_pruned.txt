Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to figure out the reagents A and B from the given options. Let's break them down one by one.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. Reacting with NaCN... I think that's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, under certain conditions, ketones can react with cyanide ions. But usually, the addition of HCN to ketones is done under specific conditions.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in a basic solution, like with NaOH, maybe. But wait, butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something else (A) to form a cyanohydrin. Oh right! The cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source, like HCN or NaCN, in the presence of an acid or base catalyst. The product is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group.

Wait, so for the formation of the cyanohydrin, the conditions are typically acidic or basic. I remember that sometimes, H3O+ is used as a catalyst. Because when you add HCN to a ketone, you need an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. So the reaction would be: ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin.

But in this case, the reagent is NaCN. So maybe the solution is basic because NaCN is a strong base? Or perhaps they use a weak acid to protonate. Hmm. Wait, no, NaCN is a salt of a strong base and weak acid. So it's basic. So maybe in the presence of an acid, like H3O+ (option A or B), the solution becomes acidic, which helps in the protonation of the carbonyl.

So the first step is that butan-2-one (a ketone) reacts with NaCN and H3O+ (A). The acid would protonate the carbonyl, making it more reactive towards the cyanide ion. The CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, the oxygen gets a negative charge, then water comes in, and eventually, you get the elimination of HCN or something like that. Wait, but wait, in the product, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So that's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, no. Let me draw the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it forms a cyanohydrin, the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but 2-hydroxy-2-methyl would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or is it (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the structure. But regardless, the main point is that the reagent A is H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is probably hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Nitrile hydrolysis can occur under different conditions. In acidic conditions, it typically produces a carboxylic acid, but sometimes with HCl as a catalyst. Alternatively, in basic conditions, you might get a different product, like an amide or an acid depending on the workup.

Wait, the second reaction uses B as the reagent, and the product is a carboxylic acid. So the conditions must be for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

The typical conditions for such hydrolysis involve either strong acid or strong base. For example, in the presence of HCl (acidic conditions), nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids when heated. Alternatively, using H2O and some acid catalyst like HCl, or maybe a base if it's another condition.

Wait, the second reagent B is in the presence of H2O. So it's a hydrolysis reaction. So if B is HCl, then it's acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, let me think: nitrile hydrolysis can be done in two ways. One is under acidic conditions (like H2SO4, H2O, heat) to form a carboxylic acid. Another is under basic conditions (like NaOH, H2O, heat) to form a carboxylate salt, which is then acidified to get the acid.

So in this problem, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the workup after hydrolysis would involve acid. But looking
