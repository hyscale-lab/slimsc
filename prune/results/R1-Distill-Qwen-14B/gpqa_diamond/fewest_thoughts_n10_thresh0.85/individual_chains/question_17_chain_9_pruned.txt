Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like calcium. So the Ca-EDTA complex is formed by the reaction between Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (I think the EDTA is usually in the deprotonated form when it binds metals). The formation constant K is given, which is a big number, so the complex is very stable.

I think the formula for the formation constant (Kf) is Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M, I can denote that as the concentration of the complex, say [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Because it's stoichiometric, I assume that all the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA, so the free [Ca²+] would be very low. But wait, the problem is to find [Ca²+], right?

So, let me set up the equation. Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][Y^4-] ), where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. But wait, I don't know the concentration of Y^4-; that's another variable. Hmm, but in solution, the EDTA can be in different protonated forms. But the problem says the pH is ideal, so I guess we're assuming that all the free EDTA is in the Y^4- form. Wait, no, because EDTA is a polydentate ligand and has multiple pKa values. Its deprotonation depends on pH. But since the pH is ideal, perhaps the solution is such that the majority of EDTA is in the Y^4- form, so [Y^4-] is approximately the total EDTA concentration minus that which is bound in the complex. Or wait, no, because the problem says the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps the EDTA is all in the Y^4- form?

Wait, another thought. The overall concentration of EDTA would be equal to [Y^4-] plus the complex [CaEDTA^2-], but since the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming the initial EDTA solution was in excess, but wait, wait, I don't think we have the initial concentration. Maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is that the EDTA is present in such a way that all the free EDTA is Y^4-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me think. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So that's the [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. The Kf is given as 5e10. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But I don't know the concentrations of Ca²+ or EDTA^4- separately. But maybe there's an assumption here. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the EDTA is in excess, but wait no, because the Kf is so large. Let me think: the Kf is 5e10, which is a huge value, so the reaction goes almost to completion, meaning that almost all the Ca²+ and Y^4- are consumed to form the complex.

Wait, but wait, in this case, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. So let's assume that the solution is such that all the Ca²+ is in the complex. So [Ca²+] would be very low, which is what the question is asking for.

But I need to find [Ca²+]. Let me think about this. Let me denote:

Let’s let s = [Ca²+]. Then [EDTA^4-] can be calculated based on the total EDTA concentration.

Wait, but what's the total EDTA concentration? Alternatively, perhaps the solution is that the concentration of free EDTA is much less than the concentration of the complex, so that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total EDTA minus that in the complex. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider that when the EDTA is in solution, it's either in the form of Y^4- or in the complex. But in this case, since the pH is ideal, perhaps the Y^4- concentration is equal to the total EDTA minus the amount in the complex. But I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the total concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex plus the concentration of free EDTA (Y^4-). But I don't know the total EDTA concentration. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the concentration of free EDTA (Y^4-) is negligible compared to the complex. Hmm, but Kf is large, so the complex is favored.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentration of EDTA is much higher than the Ca²+ concentration. Let me think: the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps the total EDTA is 0.02 M, because each complex has one EDTA. So the total [EDTA] is 0.02 M. But wait, then the EDTA would be either as Y^4- or as the complex. So [EDTA_total] = [Y^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = [Y^4-] + 0.02 M.

But without knowing the total EDTA concentration, I can't directly find [Y^4-]. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the concentration of Y^4- is so low that it's approximately equal to the [Ca²+] times Kf and the [CaEDTA^2-]. Maybe that's a way to approach it.

Let me write the
