Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think this through.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, but I'm not going to peek at them now, I'll try to work it out.

Wait, rhombohedral crystal structure. Oh right, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all the edges are of equal length, but the angles between them aren't 90 degrees. So it's a special case where the unit cell is a rhombohedron. In a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, but the angles can vary. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees, which is quite acute.

The interatomic distance being 10 Angstroms—wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice. In a crystal, the lattice parameter is the edge length of the unit cell. So is the interatomic distance the same as a, the lattice parameter? I think so. So a = 10 Angstroms here.

The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. For a given plane (hkl), the interplanar distance d is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + kl + lh)/(a² cos² θ)

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Another approach: The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is derived from the Miller indices (hkl) and the lattice parameters.

Wait, for a cubic crystal, the formula is straightforward: d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But rhombohedral is not cubic, so the formula must be more complicated.

I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos ρ )

where ρ is the angle between the edges. Wait, but in the rhombohedral system, all angles are equal. So in this case, since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, the angle ρ is 30 degrees. But wait, wait. The formula I'm thinking of might actually involve cos(alpha), but I'm not sure about the exact expression.

Alternatively, another formula I've heard of for interplanar distances in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh)(1 - cos θ) )

Is that right? Hmm, I think I might
