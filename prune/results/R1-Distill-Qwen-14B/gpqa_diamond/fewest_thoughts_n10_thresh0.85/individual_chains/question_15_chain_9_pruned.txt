Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Let me think this through step by step. 

First, I remember that the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of their host star, blocking some of the star's light. The probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But in this case, since both planets are Earth-like, I guess their sizes are similar, but maybe their stars' sizes matter more.

The question says both planets have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star. Oh, and the host star of Planet_1 is more massive, twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, wait, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but has the same radius as Planet_1's host, I guess both stars have similar sizes despite the mass difference.

I need to find the transit probability for each planet. Transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star's size. The formula I recall is that the probability is roughly proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and R_s is the star's radius. But wait, actually, the probability is more accurately given by a geometric consideration. The formula is (R_p + R_s) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, I think it's (R_p / a) multiplied by something else. Wait, no, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) * (R_s / a) ? Or perhaps it's (R_s / a) times (R_p / R_s), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about the transit probability formula. The transit probability, P, is given by the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block (which is a circle with diameter equal to the sum of the planet and star radii) to the area of the sky as seen from Earth. But simplifying, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2 or something like that. Or wait, another approach: the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital radius (semi-major axis) projected onto the plane of the sky. So the probability is roughly (R_p + R_s) / (a) × something else. 

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the area where this alignment can happen (the area around the star where the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough to cause a transit) over the total possible area. But I'm getting a bit tangled here, so maybe I should look up the formula from what I remember.

Another thought: the transit probability (P) for a planet is roughly given by P ≈ (R_p
