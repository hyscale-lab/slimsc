Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx^5). And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Like, parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if I have a parallax, the distance is the reciprocal. 

But wait, in this case, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Let me express N in terms of distance. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ). Because plx is 1/d, so plx squared would be (1/d)^2, and so on. So plx^5 is (1/d)^5.

So 1/(plx^5) becomes 1 / (1/(d^5)) ), which simplifies to d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. I think this is about the rate of change, like the number per unit distance. Or perhaps the number density as you move from one distance to another.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The number
