Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The state of the electron is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, so first, I probably need to normalize this state because the coefficients are complex numbers. Since it's proportional, I need to find the normalization constant.

Wait, the problem mentions measuring the probability in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij is ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Oh, so the matrix is 2x2 because it's spin-½, right? So for i and j being 1 and 2 (since up and down are the two states), the matrix would look like:

[0   ħ/2]
[ħ/2 0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Because the matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j. So the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Hmm, that looks like a spin operator in the x or y direction maybe? Because the Pauli matrices have similar structures, but scaled. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if this operator is that scaled by ħ/2, yeah.

So the operator in question is A = (ħ/2) * sigma_x, since sigma_x is the Pauli matrix for x-direction spin.

Wait, no, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if A has [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], then A is (ħ/2) sigma_x. Because sigma_x has 1s in the off-diagonal, so when multiplied by ħ/2, we get the A matrix.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, right? Because any scalar multiple of a matrix has the same eigenstates as the original matrix. So the eigenstates are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the spin states in the x-direction—like |+x> and |-x> maybe.

But wait, the problem says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the square of the coefficients give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), I think. Because sigma_x has eigenstates |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

Wait, let me make sure. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. So when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2. So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x> with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and then the probabilities are the square of the coefficients' magnitudes.

But first, I should normalize the given state. Let's see, the state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

Wait, the state is |alpha> = C*(1+i)|up> + C*(2-i)|down>, where C is the normalization constant. Wait, no, wait. The problem says it's proportional, so perhaps it's (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|
