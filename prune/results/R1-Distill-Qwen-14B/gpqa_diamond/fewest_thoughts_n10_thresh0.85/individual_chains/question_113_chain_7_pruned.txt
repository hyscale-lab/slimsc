Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I've got an unknown compound, and I need to determine its chemical formula based on the spectroscopic data provided. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Hmm, let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR. The very broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests an O-H stretch, maybe in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a broad peak, could it be an alcohol? Or maybe a carbonyl group with an O-H, like a ketone? No, wait, the broad peak is usually for O-H in alcohols or maybe a phenol. Oh, but wait, another peak at 1700 and 1650. Those are around the carbonyl region. So 1700 is probably a C=O stretch. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe a conjugated one, like in a carbonyl group attached to something else, or maybe an aromatic ring.

So, maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one carbonyl and another functional group. Wait, the 1700 is maybe a ketone or ester or aldehyde. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ester or something. Or maybe an amide, but that's less likely since the options don't have N.

Looking at the 1H NMR, there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means there's a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, probably in a structure that allows for vinyl protons, such as CH2=CH-... but in a conjugated system maybe. Also, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests maybe an aromatic compound, but wait, aromatic rings typically don't have vinyl hydrogens because the protons are usually ortho, meta, para and don't show as vinyl unless it's a substituted benzene with a double bond adjacent.

Wait, noâ€”vinyl protons are those on a double bond, like in CH2=CH2. So the compound might have an alkene group, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, perhaps. Because in such a case, the carbonyl is conjugated with the double bond, which would lower the carbonyl's wavenumber, possibly matching the 1700 and 1650 peaks.

So, considering that, maybe the structure has a conjugated carbonyl and an alkene. So maybe it's something like a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Now, the Mass Spec. The fragment at m/z 45. Let me think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments are CH3O (31?), no. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O (which is 31
