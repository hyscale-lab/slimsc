Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let's break this down. 

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which I remember gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is P2=3P1. 

Both have circular orbits, so that shouldn't complicate things. Their host stars have the same radii, but the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Wait, but same radii? That's interesting because usually, more massive stars are larger, but maybe Planet_2's host is a slightly evolved star that's expanded a bit, keeping the radius same as Planet_1's host. 

I'm trying to recall how the probability of a planet transiting relates to its orbital parameters and the star's characteristics. Oh right, the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But since we can't change the planet's size, the key factors are the star's size and the planet's orbital distance. 

Wait, the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is planet radius and R_s is star radius. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us, which is a geometric probability. The formula is (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis. But actually, the exact probability is (R* + R_p)/a, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, it's roughly R*/a. 

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is (R*/a) multiplied by some factor. Or maybe it's R_p/(R_*)^2? Or perhaps a different formula. Let me think again. 

The transit probability is the area of the star that the planet can cover, which is (R_p)/(R_s) squared, but that's the area blocked. Wait, no, the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis
