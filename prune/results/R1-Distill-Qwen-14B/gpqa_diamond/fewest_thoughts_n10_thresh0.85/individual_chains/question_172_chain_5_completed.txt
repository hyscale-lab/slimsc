Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with such problems, the Boltzmann equation comes into play. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between those levels.

The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, 1.38 is approximately the Boltzmann constant (k) multiplied by temperature, but I'm not sure about that yet.

Since the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the Boltzmann distribution applies. The Boltzmann equation is N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where N is the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the statistical weights might be the same if the energy levels are similar and not changing the ratio. The problem says the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So for star_1, the ratio N_upper/N_lower is 2 times that of star_2. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2*R2.

Each R is given by (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Wait, but if the energy levels are the same, then the g factors might be the same for both stars, so the ratio would just be based on temperature.

So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). Or wait, wait—actually, the energy difference is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower, so the exponent should be -ΔE/(k T). So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Given that R1 = 2 R2, substituting the expressions:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Hmm, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. Taking ln:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Let me rearrange this equation. I can bring the terms involving T to one side. Let's see:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, wait, no, because when I rearrange, it's:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

So factoring out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

So:

(ΔE)/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let's compute 1/T2 - 1/T1:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Right.

So substituting back: 

(ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the question gives a value for ΔE. Let me see, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So ΔE is equal to k_B * T, but that's when the energy is equal to k*T. Hmm, but in this case, the ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k_B (1.38e-23 J/K) times 1 K. So ΔE = k * T. Wait, that would mean T is 1 K. But wait, stars are much hotter than that, so maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. If ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, that's exactly k_B (since k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k*B, so ΔE/(k) = (k * B)/k = B, where B is some value. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's plug the numbers in.

Given that ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE = k * (1 K). So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

(1 K) * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) * K ?

Wait, the units might not be matching, but perhaps I can ignore that for now because the equation is getting simplified. So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches our result.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps. The initial setup: R1 = 2 R2. R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So with R1 = 2 R2, taking the ratio.

Wait, another approach: Let me re-express the ratio.

R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

Wait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract them. So, R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 -1/T1) )

We know R1/R2 = 2, so:

exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

[ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as before. So,

[ΔE/(k)] ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Which again gives ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), since ΔE/(k) is 1 K (because ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, k =1.38e-23 J/K, so 1 K).

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation is used to relate the excitation levels of energy states to temperature and energy differences. The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(N_{\text{upper}}\) and \(N_{\text{lower}}\) are the number of particles in the upper and lower energy levels, \(g_{\text{upper}}\) and \(g_{\text{lower}}\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, i.e., \(R_1 = 2 R_2\), where \(R_1 = \exp(-\Delta E / k T_1)\) and \(R_2 = \exp(-\Delta E / k T_2)\). Taking the ratio of \(R_1\) to \(R_2\):

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp(-\Delta E / k T_1)}{\exp(-\Delta E / k T_2)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \(R_1 / R_2 = 2\), we have:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D: 

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
