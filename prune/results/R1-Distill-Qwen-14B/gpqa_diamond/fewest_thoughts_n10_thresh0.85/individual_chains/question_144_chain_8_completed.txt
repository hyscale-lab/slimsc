Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember that the decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Let's see, the question gives me the production energy, mass, and width of the meson X. I think I need to calculate the mean decay distance using these values.

First, I need to recall the formula for the mean decay distance. I think it's something like the product of the particle's lifetime (tau), its velocity (beta times c), and maybe some constants. The formula I'm trying to remember is probably d = gamma * beta * c * tau. Because gamma accounts for time dilation, beta is the velocity over c, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I find the lifetime? Oh right, the width Gamma is related to the mean lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Gamma = ħ / tau, so tau is ħ / Gamma. But wait, Gamma is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Let me jot down the variables:

E_X = 8 GeV (production energy)
m_X = 1.2 GeV (mass)
Gamma_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV)

So, Gamma is in GeV, and ħ is approximately 0.658 GeV·s (I think that's the value when ħc is about 197 MeV·fm, but perhaps I should double-check the exact value). Wait, no, I'm mixing ħ and ħc. Let me think: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Oh wait, maybe I should use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the mean proper lifetime tau = ħ / Gamma. But units need to be consistent. Let's see:

Gamma is given in GeV. So Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

But ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, actually, I think I might have messed up the value of ħ. Let me verify. The value of ħ in units of GeV·s is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So yeah, that's correct.

So tau is approximately 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that:

0.32 GeV is the denominator, so 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 6.582 / 0.32 = approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25. 6.582 /0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. So tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Next, I need to find the velocity beta of the meson. How do I find beta? Well, I have the production energy E_X and mass m_X. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m c², but since we're working in units where c=1, E = gamma * m.

So gamma is E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Wait, 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666..., so gamma is 6.6667.

Then, the relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So I can solve for beta.

Let me compute that. Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (4/3)^2 * 9 = (4/3)^2 * (9) is (16/9)*9 = 16. So gamma² is (4/3)^2 = 16/9? Wait, wait, wait, 6.6667 is 20/3, right? Because 6.666 is 20/3 approximately.

Wait, 20/3 is 6.666..., yes. So gamma is 20/3. So gamma squared is (400/9).

So gamma squared = 1 / (1 - beta^2) = (400/9).

So 1 - beta^2 = 9/400.

Thus, beta^2 = 1 - 9/400 = (400 -9)/400 = 391/400.

So beta = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(391)/20.

What's sqrt(391)? Let me compute. 19^2 is 361, 20^2 is 400. 391 is 9 less than 400, so sqrt(391) ≈ 19.774. Let me check: 19.774^2 ≈ (19.77)^2 = approx 390. So yes, sqrt(391) is about 19.774.

So beta ≈ 19.774 / 20 = 0.9887.

Wait, more accurately, sqrt(391) = sqrt(400 -9) = sqrt( (20)^2 - (3)^2 ). Hmm, but perhaps more precise approximation is better. Alternatively, I can compute sqrt(391) as follows:

19^2 = 361, 19.7^2= (19 + 0.7)^2 = 361 + 2*19*0.7 + 0.49 = 361 + 26.6 + 0.49 = 388.09.

Wait, 19.7^2 is 388.09, which is less than 391. The difference is 391 - 388.09 = 2.91.

Each 0.1 increase in x adds about 2*19.7*0.1 + (0.1)^2 = 3.94 + 0.01 = 3.95 per 0.1. So to get 2.91, need about 2.91 / 3.95 ≈ 0.737 of 0.1, so approx 0.0737.

So 19.7 + 0.0737 = 19.7737. So sqrt(391) ≈ 19.7737.

So beta ≈ 19.7737 / 20 = 0.988685.

So beta is approximately 0.9887 c.

Next, compute gamma * beta. Gamma is 6.6667, and beta is 0.9887.

So gamma * beta = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ Let's compute 6.6667 * 0.9887.

6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ (6 * 0.9887) + (0.6667 * 0.9887).

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 0.6591.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈ 6.5913.

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.5913.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, 6.6667 * 0.9887 is:

6.6667 * 0.9887 = 6.6667*(1 - 0.0113) = 6.6667 - 6.6667*0.0113.

6.6667 *0.0113 ≈ 0.0755.

So 6.6667 - 0.0755 ≈ 6.5912.

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.5912.

Now, the mean decay distance d is given by d = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, tau is the proper lifetime, so the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the lifetime is gamma * tau, and the velocity is beta c, so distance is (gamma tau) * (beta c) = gamma beta c tau.

So d = gamma beta c tau.

We have all the pieces now.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So:

d = gamma_beta * c * tau.

gamma_beta is 6.5912.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So plug in the numbers:

d = 6.5912 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

First, compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

3e8 is 3 × 10^8.

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 × 10^-24.

Multiply them: 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625.

Exponents: 10^8 * 10^-24 = 10^-16.

So 6.170625 × 10^-16 m.

Then multiply by 6.5912.

So 6.170625e-16 * 6.5912 ≈ Let's compute 6.170625 *6.5912.

Compute 6 *6.5912 = 39.5472.

0.170625 *6.5912: Let's compute 0.170625 *6.5912.

0.170625 *6 = 1.02375.

0.170625 *0.5912 ≈ approx 0.1008.

So total ≈ 1.02375 + 0.1008 ≈ 1.12455.

So 6.170625 *6.5912 ≈ 39.5472 + 1.12455 ≈ 40.67175.

So 40.67175e-16 m, which is 4.067175e-15 m.

Wait, but wait, I have 6.170625e-16 * 6.5912 = ?

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 6.170625 *6.5912.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 6.170625 * 6.5912:

Let me do it as:

6 *6 =36, 6*0.5912=3.5472; 0.170625*6=1.02375; 0.170625*0.5912≈0.1008.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 6.170625 *6.5912.

I think I might have made a mistake in the previous step. Let me compute 6.170625 × 6.5912.

Alternatively, perhaps 6.170625 * 6.5912 ≈ 6.17 *6.59 ≈ 6 *6.5 + 6*0.09 + 0.17*6.5 + 0.17*0.09.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 6.170625 *6.5912.

6.170625 * 6.5912 = ?

I can multiply 6.170625 *6 = 37.02375.

6.170625 *0.5912 = Let's compute:

6.170625 * 0.5 = 3.0853125.

6.170625 *0.0912 = let's compute 6.170625 *0.09 = 0.55535625, and 6.170625 *0.0012=0.00740475.

So 0.55535625 +0.00740475 = 0.562761.

So 3.0853125 + 0.562761 = 3.6480735.

So total is 37.02375 + 3.6480735 = 40.6718235.

So approximately 40.6718235.

So 6.170625e-16 *6.5912 = 40.6718235e-16 m.

Which is 4.06718235e-15 m.

So the decay distance d ≈4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

So our calculation is about 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, why is there a slight discrepancy? Maybe due to more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I approximated beta as 0.9887, but perhaps a more accurate value would change things. Also, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma.

Wait, gamma is 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.666666... exactly, because 8 /1.2 = 20/3.

Wait, gamma is 20/3 = 6.6666666667.

So let's compute beta more accurately.

Gamma = 20/3.

So gamma squared is (400/9).

Gamma squared = 1/(1 - beta^2) = 400/9. So 1 - beta^2 = 9/400.

So beta^2 = 1 - 9/400 = (400-9)/400= 391/400.

So beta = sqrt(391)/20.

Wait, sqrt(391) is about 19.77459655.

So beta = 19.77459655 /20 = 0.9887298275.

So beta is approximately 0.9887298275.

So gamma * beta = (20/3) * (0.9887298275) = (20 * 0.9887298275) /3.

20 * 0.9887298275 = 19.77459655.

Divide by 3: 19.77459655 /3 ≈ 6.591532183.

So gamma_beta is approximately 6.591532183.

Now, tau is ħ / Gamma. Let me compute tau more accurately.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = 6.582 /0.32 = let's compute this exactly.

6.582 /0.32.

0.32 × 20 =6.4, which leaves 0.182.

0.32 × 0.56875 = 0.182 (because 0.32 * 0.56875 = 0.32 * (56.875/100) )= 0.32 * (56.875/100) = 0.182.

So 6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 is 20.56875, so tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So the decay distance d = gamma_beta * c * tau.

gamma_beta is approximately 6.591532183.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So d = 6.591532183 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute each part:

First, multiply 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

3e8 is 3 × 1e8.

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 ×1e-24.

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) ×1e8 *1e-24 = 6.170625 ×1e-16.

So 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by gamma_beta (approx 6.591532183):

6.170625e-16 *6.591532183.

Compute 6.170625 ×6.591532183.

6 *6.591532183 = 39.5491931.

0.170625 ×6.591532183:

0.170625 *6 =1.02375.

0.170625 *0.591532183 ≈approx 0.1008.

So total approximately 1.02375 +0.1008=1.12455.

So total 39.5491931 +1.12455=40.6737431.

So, 40.6737431e-16 m =4.06737431e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15.

So my calculation is approximately 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15).

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay distance:

\[
d = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \) (Proper Lifetime)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),

we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) (Lorentz Factor)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}
\]

Given:
- \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),

we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \) (Velocity as a Fraction of \( c \))
The relation between \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]

Rearranging for \( \beta^2 \):

\[
\beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{44.444} = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \gamma \beta \)
Using \( \gamma = 6.6667 \) and \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5912.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Decay Distance \( d \)
The decay distance is:

\[
d = \gamma \beta c \tau.
\]

Substituting:
- \( \gamma \beta \approx 6.5912 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we compute:

\[
d = 6.5912 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
3 \times 2.056875 = 6.170625, \quad \text{and} \quad 10^8 \times 10^{-24} = 10^{-16}.
\]

Thus:

\[
3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Now multiply by \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
d = 6.5912 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Compute \( 6.5912 \times 6.170625 \):

\[
6.5912 \times 6.170625 \approx 40.6718.
\]

Thus:

\[
d \approx 40.6718 \times 10^{-16} = 4.06718 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with Options
The calculated decay distance is approximately \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which is closest to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

ANSWER: B
