Okay, so I've been given this physics problem about electric potential energy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e, and they're in an isolated system. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, right?

Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Oh wait, but since we're dealing with multiple charges, I think I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up.

Wait, but how many pairs are there? Let me think. There are 13 particles in total. The 13th is fixed at P, so all 12 others are at 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is at P, and each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from it. 

But wait, the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 charges. So each of those 12 has a charge of 2e, and the 13th is also 2e. So each pair between the 13th and a charge at 2m contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Let me compute that.

Wait, but each charge is 2e, so 2e * 2e would be (2e)^2. So each such pair contributes k*(2e)^2/(2). Because r is 2m. So, for each of the 12, that's 12 times that value.

So that's the first part, the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding. But wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges themselves? Because they're all at the same point (2m from P), are they interacting with each other? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, but I'm assuming that they can
