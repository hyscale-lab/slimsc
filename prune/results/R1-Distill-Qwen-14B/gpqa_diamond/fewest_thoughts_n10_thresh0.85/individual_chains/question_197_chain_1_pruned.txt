Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks mentioned are in the ranges 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹. I remember that IR is useful for functional groups. The big peaks here are at 1720 and around 1610. The 1720 peak is probably a carbonyl (C=O) group. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But wait, looking at the NMR data might help.

The 1610 cm⁻¹ peak is around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs. The 1450 cm⁻¹ is possibly for aromatic ring deformation. The 3400-2500 region might indicate O-H stretching, like in an acid, or maybe an alkyne (though I'm not sure about that). But the 1720 peak could be more telling. If it's an acid, the O-H would show a broad peak in NMR, but I'll check that.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a really high chemical shift. Common for an aldehyde proton, but also for a carboxylic acid proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, and carboxylic acids are broader and around 10-12. Here, it's a singlet and broad, which fits a carboxylic acid proton. So maybe the compound has a COOH group.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes in some cases, like if it's an aromatic ring with substituents, but that's less likely. Let me think. A broad singlet at 10.5 could be a phenolic OH, but phenols are usually lower, around 5-7 ppm, unless it's a strong acid like a nitro-substituted phenol, which might be higher. But more likely, this is a carboxylic acid.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents, maybe para-substituted. The doublets indicate coupling between adjacent protons. So if there's a substituent in the para position, like maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, but wait, another possibility is a substituent on one carbon and an adjacent group. Wait, but the integration is 2H each, which might suggest a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in positions that
