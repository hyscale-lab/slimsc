Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, when the medium is stationary, the speed v_light = c/n. But wait, in this case, the glass is moving. So I think this involves some sort of velocity addition, maybe from special relativity? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities linearly. But wait, the speed of light in the medium is already less than c, and the glass is moving with velocity v, which I'm not sure how big it is. So maybe I need to consider the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Because the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame might be different. But according to special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Oh, wait, but that's for light in a vacuum. Here the light is in a medium, so maybe that rule doesn't apply directly? Or does it?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me start over. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass (since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer). So the beam is moving towards the observer as well, but the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v, and the light is moving through the glass.

In the glass's rest frame, the speed of the light is c/n. But from the lab frame, we have to calculate the speed of the light considering the glass is moving.

Wait, but if the glass is moving, how does that affect the light's speed? Special relativity says that in any inertial frame, the speed of light is c. But that's for light in a vacuum. Here, the light is in a medium with refractive index n. Does the speed of the medium affect the observed speed of light in the medium?

I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. I've heard of the concept of the medium's motion affecting the observed speed. For example, when a medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame might change because of the motion of the medium. But I'm not certain about the exact formula.

Wait, another approach. Suppose in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at velocity u' = c/n. Now, because the glass is moving with velocity v in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity to find the lab frame's speed of the light.

The velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/cÂ²
