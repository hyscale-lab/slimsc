Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the star's surface is covered by these spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that mimic those of a planet transiting the star.

The question is: what radius would a hypothetical exoplanet have to have to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? But wait, this is under the condition that the star wasn't covered by spots. So we're comparing the brightness dip caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spots.

Hmm. So I think the approach is to calculate the relative change in brightness for both the spot scenario and the planet scenario, set them equal, and solve for the planet's radius relative to the star.

First, let's think about the star's brightness without any spots. The star emits light based on its surface area and temperature. But when there are spots, the total luminosity changes as the spots rotate into view. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star appears dimmer. The same goes for a planet transiting the star—it blocks some light from the star.

Wait, but the star has spots on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, we see different amounts of spotted area. The photometric observations would show a periodic variation as the spots come into view. But for the exoplanet case, the planet would block a part of the star's disk as it transits.

But in the problem, the situation is that either the spots or the planet cause the same amplitude in the brightness variations. So the dip in brightness when the planet transits is equal in amplitude to the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but the spots are not just a single spot; they cover 20% of the star's surface. So the overall dip would be larger than a single spot, but maybe when the star is rotating, the spots are only on the visible hemisphere. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how the spots affect the observed brightness.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the star's surface is spots. Each spot is cooler by 1000 K. So the star's overall brightness when spots are visible would be lower.

But when the star isn't blocked by a planet, the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. But for the planet case, the planet transiting the star would block a part of the star's disk, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, but the question says: to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve, what would be the planet's radius relative to the star's radius?

So, I think the approach is to calculate the relative change in brightness for both scenarios and set them equal, then solve for Rplanet/Rstar.

Let me outline the steps.

For the star with spots:

When spots are on the visible hemisphere, the star's brightness is lower because a fraction of the surface is cooler. The effective area contributing to the brightness is the unspotted part plus the spotted part, each at their respective temperatures.

But wait, the star's total luminosity without spots is L0 = 4πR^2 σ T^4. When 20% of the surface is spotted, the luminosity becomes L = (0.8 * L_unspotted) + (0.2 * L_spotted). But since the spots are on one hemisphere, perhaps the observed brightness changes as the star rotates, but when the star is observed from Earth, perhaps we see the spot coverage as the star rotates.

Wait, no. Actually, the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view. Since it's only one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots that were on the far side come into view. Wait, no, if the star is rotating, the spots on one hemisphere will be the ones facing us as the star rotates. So the spotted area is always visible when the star is in a certain phase.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.

The observed flux from the star when spots are present is lower because the spots are cooler. So the total flux from the star is F = F_unspotted + F_spotted.

F_unspotted = (1 - filling factor) * F0, where F0 is the flux per unit area without any spots.

F_spotted = filling factor * F_spot, where F_spot = σ T_spot^4 / σ T0^4 * F0.

Wait, because F is sigma T^4 per unit area. Wait, no, F = sigma T^4 multiplied by the area. Hmm, perhaps the total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

So, the star's total flux when spots are present is:

F_total = (1 - f) * F0 * (4π R^2) + f * F_spot * (4π R^2 )

Wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, F0 is the flux per unit area without spots. The unspotted area contributes (1-f) * F0 * (4π R^2) and the spotted area contributes f * F_spot * (4π R^2).

So F_total = 4π R^2 [ (1-f) F0 + f F_spot ]

But F0 is sigma T0^4, so F_spot = sigma (T0 - delta T)^4. So substituting:

F_total = 4π R^2 sigma [ (1-f) T0^4 + f (T0 - delta T)^4 ]

The star's original flux without any spots is F0_total = 4π R^2 sigma T0^4.

So the ratio of F_total to F0_total is:

F_total / F0_total = (1-f) T0^4 + f (T0 - delta T)^4 ) / T0^4

= (1-f) + f [ (T0 - delta T)/T0 ]^4

So the fractional change in flux when spots are present is (F_total / F0_total) - 1.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the amplitude of the brightness variation when the star is observed. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots come into view, which would change the observed flux.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the entire spotted area is facing us. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere. If the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star is viewed such that the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the maximum dip occurs. Then, as the star rotates, the spots move out of view, and the observed flux increases again.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has a filling factor of 20%; so 20% of the entire star's surface is covered by spots. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is lower.

Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So 20% of the entire star is covered by spots, regardless of the hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted regions are on the near side, the flux is lower than when the spots are on the far side.

But wait, the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of view. So when the star is in a certain phase, the spots are on the visible hemisphere, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem is considering the maximum dip or the periodic variation. Hmm.

But perhaps the problem is more about the overall average change in brightness due to the spots. So for a star with 20% of its surface covered by cooler spots, the average flux is lower than a star without spots.

Wait, but when the problem says "if the star was not covered by spots", what is the scenario? Are we to compare the brightness variations caused by the planet (transit) to the variation caused by the spots modulating the star's brightness as it rotates?

Wait, the question says: "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius...".

Hmm, perhaps when the star isn't covered by spots, the only signal would be from the planet. So the star's brightness variation due to the planet's transit would have the same amplitude as the star's brightness variation due to the spots.

Alternatively, perhaps we are to compute the amplitude caused by the spots (the maximum dip in brightness when the spots are fully on view) and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip when it transits.

Wait, perhaps that's the way to approach it.

So when the star is viewed such that the entire spotted area is facing us, the brightness dip would be the maximum. Alternatively, the dip when the spots are on the near side would be the maximum dip, and when on the far side, the brightness would be maximum.

Wait, the problem says that the star's one hemisphere is covered. So filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 4π R^2.

Wait, but when the star is viewed such that the entire spotted area is on the near side, the observed flux would be lower.

So the maximum dip would be when the entire 20% of the star's surface (the spotted area) is facing the observer. So the dip in flux would be the difference between the star's full flux and the flux when 20% of the surface is cooler.

Wait, but in reality, the star is a sphere, so when spots are on just one hemisphere, the maximum area observed would depend on the viewing angle. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible, which is 20% of the total surface.

Alternatively, maybe the star has spots on one hemisphere, so when the hemisphere is facing us, the area blocked by the spots is 20% of the star's surface. So the dip would be 20% of the star's light being reduced because those spots are cooler.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the flux.

The star's total flux with spots is:

F = F_unspotted + F_spotted.

F_unspotted = (1 - 0.2) * F0 * (R^2) * (4π /4π) )? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the area.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4π R^2. The unspotted area is 0.8 * 4π R^2, and the spotted area is 0.2 * 4π R^2.

The flux from the unspotted area is (0.8 * 4π R^2) * sigma T0^4.

The flux from the spotted area is (0.2 *4π R^2) * sigma (T0 - 1000)^4.

So the total flux is:

F = 4π R^2 sigma [ 0.8 T0^4 + 0.2 (T0 - 1000)^4 ]

The original flux without spots is F0 = 4π R^2 sigma T0^4.

So the fractional change in flux is (F - F0)/F0 = [0.8 T0^4 + 0.2 (T0 - 1000)^4] / T0^4 - 1.

Wait, but that's the average flux when spots are present. But we're looking for the amplitude of the brightness variation as the star rotates. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the fraction of the spotted area visible to us changes. When the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the entire 20% area is visible, leading to maximum dip. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so no dip—maximum brightness.

So the maximum dip would be when the entire 20% of the star is spotted and visible.

So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible, so the fractional dip is (F0 - F_spotted_visible) / F0.

Wait, but F_spotted_visible would be the flux when the spots are all visible. So F_visible = F_unspotted_visible + F_spotted_visible.

Wait, no. When the spots are on the near side, the unspotted area is (1-f) of the star's surface, but no, wait the entire unspotted area is 80% of the star. But when viewed from Earth, the star appears as a disk, so the area that's visible is a hemisphere. Wait, no. The star's surface is a sphere, so when you look at it, you see half the surface (the hemisphere facing you). So when the star is rotating, different parts of the surface come into view.

Wait, but if the spots are on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots. So the maximum dip occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. Then, the area blocked by the spots is 20% of the star's surface, which because we're seeing a hemisphere, 20% of the entire star's surface is 40% of the visible hemisphere.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

The star's surface area is 4π R^2. When viewed from Earth, the visible area is 2π R^2 (a hemisphere). So when the spotted hemisphere is facing Earth, the area of the spots visible is 0.2 * 2π R^2. So the fraction of the visible area that's spotted is 0.2 / 2 = 0.1, or 10%.

Wait, because 20% of the entire star is 0.2 *4π R². But when viewed, the visible area is 2π R², so the fraction of the visible area that's spotted is (0.2 *4π R² ) / (2π R²) ) = (0.8 π R²) / ( π R² )= 0.8? No, wait, 0.2 *4π R² is 0.8 π R²? Wait, wait:

Wait, 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8 π R²? No, 0.2 *4 is 0.8, so 0.8 π R². When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 2π R², so the fraction of the visible area that's spotted is (0.8 π R²) / (2π R²) ) = 0.4, or 40%.

Wait, that's a big fraction. Hmm. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the visible surface is spots. But each spot is cooler by 1000 K.

So the flux from the unspotted part of the visible hemisphere is (1 - 0.4) * sigma T0^4 * 2π R².

The flux from the spotted part is 0.4 * sigma (T0 - 1000)^4 * 2π R².

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotted_visible = 2π R² [ (0.6) sigma T0^4 + (0.4) sigma (T0 - 1000)^4 ]

Compare this to the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The unspotted hemisphere has no spots, so flux is:

F_unspotted_visible = 2π R² sigma T0^4.

The star's total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is F_unspotted_visible, and when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, it's F_spotted_visible.

So the difference in flux would cause the dip when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So the dip in brightness is (F_unspotted_visible - F_spotted_visible) / F_unspotted_visible.

Let me compute that.

Flux dip = [ F_unspotted_visible - F_spotted_visible ] / F_unspotted_visible

= [ 2π R² sigma T0^4 - 2π R² sigma [0.6 T0^4 + 0.4 (T0 -d T)^4 ] ] / (2π R² sigma T0^4 )

Simplify numerator:

= 2π R² sigma [ T0^4 - 0.6 T0^4 - 0.4 (T0 - dT)^4 ]

= 2π R² sigma [ 0.4 T0^4 - 0.4 (T0 - dT)^4 ]

So numerator becomes 0.4 * 2π R² sigma [ T0^4 - (T0 - dT)^4 ]

Divide by denominator 2π R² sigma T0^4:

= [ 0.4 ( T0^4 - (T0 - dT)^4 ) ] / T0^4

= 0.4 [ 1 - ( (T0 - dT)/T0 )^4 ]

So the dip amplitude is 0.4 [ 1 - ( (T0 - dT)/T0 )^4 ].

Given T0 = 6000 K, dT = 1000 K, so T0 - dT =5000 K.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

(5/6) is approximately 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^2 ≈ 0.6944; squared again ≈ 0.4823.

So (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.4: 0.4 *0.5177 ≈ 0.20708.

So the dip is approximately 20.7% of the star's flux.

Wait, that's a big dip. But let me verify the calculation.

Wait, the dip is when the spotted hemisphere is visible, so 40% of the visible area is spots. Each spot reduces the flux in that area.

So the dip is 0.4*(1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.4 * (1 - 0.4823) = 0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.207.

So about 20.7% dip in brightness.

But wait, is that the amplitude? Or is that the actual dip when the spots are visible? Because when the other hemisphere is visible, the brightness is higher, so the amplitude would be the difference between the two extremes.

Wait, the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, divided by the maximum brightness. Or is the amplitude the maximum dip, which is what we just calculated.

In any case, the planet's transit would cause a dip in brightness. The dip is caused by the planet blocking a part of the star's disk. The amplitude of the dip is (Area blocked / Total area) * (T_planet / T_star)^4? Wait, no. Wait, the planet doesn't emit any light; it just blocks the star's light. So the dip in flux is proportional to the area blocked.

But wait, the planet transiting the star blocks a portion of the star's light. The flux dip is (Area of planet's disk / Area of star's disk) * (assuming the planet is so close that the entire area it blocks is at the star's temperature). Wait, but the planet doesn't emit any light, so the dip is simply (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is π R_p^2, and the star's area is π R_s^2, so the fraction is (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, when a planet transits a star, the flux dip is (R_p / R_s)^2, because the planet blocks that area of the star. So the relative dip in flux is (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, but in reality, the star's flux is a sum of all its surface areas. So when a planet blocks a part of it, the blocked flux is the area of the planet's disk multiplied by the star's surface brightness.

But the star's surface brightness is uniform (assuming no spots), so the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2.

So in this problem, the dip caused by the planet would be (R_p / R_s)^2.

But the dip caused by the spots is about 0.207, or 20.7% of the star's flux.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Because the dip from the spots is when the hemisphere with spots is visible, which causes a lower flux. The dip in brightness is the difference between the maximum flux (when the unspotted hemisphere is visible) and the minimum flux (when the spotted hemisphere is visible).

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between these two fluxes divided by the maximum flux.

But the planet's transit dip is a single dip of (R_p/R_s)^2 in amplitude.

Wait, but in the star's case, the amplitude is the difference between F_unspotted_visible and F_spotted_visible, divided by F_unspotted_visible.

Which we calculated as about 0.207, or 20.7%.

So for the planet to cause the same amplitude (20.7%), the dip would have to be 20.7%, which is (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.207.

So solving for R_p/R_s:

R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.207) ≈ sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.455.

Wait, but that's about 0.455, which is not among the options. The options are around 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, 0.39.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the dip calculation. Let me double-check.

So the maximum dip when the spotted hemisphere is visible is (F_unspotted_visible - F_spotted_visible)/F_unspotted_visible.

Wait, F_unspotted_visible is the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, which is 2π R² sigma T0^4.

F_spotted_visible is the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible, which is:

2π R² sigma [0.6 T0^4 + 0.4 (T0 - dT)^4 ]

So the dip is:

( F_unspotted_visible - F_spotted_visible ) / F_unspotted_visible

= [ 2π R² sigma T0^4 - 2π R² sigma (0.6 T0^4 + 0.4 (T0 - dT)^4 ) ] / (2 π R^2 sigma T0^4 )

Simplify numerator:

= 2π R² sigma [ T0^4 - 0.6 T0^4 -0.4 (T0 -dT)^4 ]

= 2π R² sigma [ 0.4 T0^4 - 0.4 (T0 -dT)^4 ]

= 0.4 * 2π R² sigma [ T0^4 - (T0 -dT)^4 ]

Denominator is 2π R² sigma T0^4.

So when I divide them, the 2π R² sigma cancels out, and we get:

[0.4 ( T0^4 - (T0 -dT)^4 ) ] / T0^4

= 0.4 [ 1 - ( (T0 - dT)/T0 )^4 ]

So plugging in the numbers:

T0 =6000 K, dT=1000 K.

(T0 -dT) =5000 K.

(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = (approx) 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.4: 0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.207.

So the dip is about 20.7% of the star's maximum flux.

Wait, but if the planet's dip is (R_p/R_s)^2, and we set this equal to 0.207, then R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.455.

But none of the options are close to 0.45. The closest option is A) ~0.39.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should have considered the brightness variation caused by the spots not as a dip when the entire hemisphere is visible, but as a periodic variation due to the star's rotation.

Wait, the star has a rotational period, and the spots are on one hemisphere. As the star rotates, the spotted area comes into and out of view, causing a periodic change in brightness.

In that case, the maximum amplitude would be the difference between the flux when the entire spotted area is visible and when it's not, divided by the average flux.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that maximum dip when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible is 20.7% of the star's flux.

But perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to cover a certain fraction of the visible disk as it spins, leading to a sinusoidal variation in brightness.

Wait, maybe the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is not 20.7%, but something else. Because when the star rotates, the fraction of the spotted area that is visible varies sinusoidally.

But wait, the star's rotation would cause the spots to appear as a small spot moving across the disk. Wait, no, the star's rotation would cause the entire spotted hemisphere to come into view, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the spots are spread across one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the fraction of the visible surface that is spotted varies sinusoidally. So the observed flux would vary as the spots rotate in and out of view.

Wait, perhaps the maximum and minimum fluxes are when the entire spotted area is visible and when it's not. So the amplitude would be the difference between the two.

But in that case, the dip would be 20.7% as I calculated earlier.

But then the planet's transit would have to produce a dip of 20.7%, requiring (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.207, which gives R_p/R_s ≈ 0.455, which isn't among the options.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I calculate the dip.

Wait, another thought: when the star has spots, the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation depends on the size of the spots and their temperature difference.

Wait, let me think about the star's brightness without any spots. The light curve is flat. When spots are present, the brightness varies as the spots rotate into view.

The amplitude of this variation would be the difference between the flux when the spots are on the near side and when they are on the far side, divided by the average flux.

Wait, but in reality, the star's rotation would cause a sinusoidal variation in the observed flux because the fraction of the surface that is spotted varies with the cosine of the angle between the star's rotation axis and our line of sight.

But perhaps the amplitude can be approximated as the same as the dip when the entire spotted area is on the near side.

But perhaps I should model the brightness variation as a periodic function.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more analogous to starspots causing a variation in brightness that's similar to a planet transit. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots would be similar to the amplitude caused by the planet.

So the star's brightness variation due to spots would have an amplitude of (R_p/R_s)^2, but I'm getting a 0.207 dip, which is not matching any options.

Wait, maybe I should consider the brightness variation due to the spots as a different calculation. Another approach: the relative change in brightness when a spot is present is the difference in flux between the star with and without the spot, relative to the star without the spot.

So the flux with a spot is F = F_unspotted + F_spot.

So F_unspotted = F0 * (1 - A), where A is the area fraction of the spot.

F_spot = F0 * A * (T_spot / T0)^4.

So F = F0 (1 - A) + F0 A (T_spot / T0)^4.

The relative change is (F - F0)/F0 = [ (1 - A) + A (T_spot / T0)^4 ] - 1.

= - A [ 1 - (T_spot / T0)^4 ].

The maximum dip is when A is the maximum fraction of the star's surface that's visible as a spot.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the visible area of the spot changes. So the maximum A visible is when the spot is fully on the near side, which would be a disk area of (R_spot)^2, but perhaps that's getting into more detail.

Wait, perhaps this approach is not leading me to the correct answer, and I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a comparison between the dip caused by a planet and the dip caused by the spots, where the amplitude is the same.

So the dip from the spots is calculated as (0.2) * ( (T_spot / T0)^4 ), but that might not be correct.

Wait, another approach: the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as the brightness variation due to a planet blocking a part of the star.

But in the case of spots, the flux is lower when the spots are visible. So the dip in brightness is (fraction of the star's surface that is spotted) * (1 - (T_spot / T0)^4).

Wait, perhaps that's the way to calculate it.

So dip = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T0)^4 ].

Which is 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ].

Which is 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.4823) ≈ 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% dip.

So for the planet, the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2.

Set them equal: (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.1035 → R_p/R_s ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Which is approximately 0.32, matching option D.

But wait, I thought earlier that the dip was 20.7%, but that was when the entire spotted hemisphere was visible, which would be a bigger dip. So why is this approach giving me a different result?

Perhaps because the 20% filling factor is the average coverage, not the maximum coverage. So the average dip would be 20% of the star's surface, each spot contributes a (1 - (T_spot / T0)^4) factor.

Wait, but the maximum dip would be when the entire 20% is visible, which would be 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)^4 ] ≈ 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, so about 10.35% dip.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots would be about 10%, and the planet's dip would be the same.

So (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.1035 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.3217, which is option D: ~0.32.

That makes sense.

So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the star's brightness variation due to spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%** (i.e., 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots).
   - Spots are cooler by \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so their temperature is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - When spots are present, the flux is the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions:
     \[
     F_{\text{total}} = F_{\text{unspotted}} + F_{\text{spotted}}
     \]
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = (1 - f) F_0, \quad F_{\text{spotted}} = f F_0 \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4
     \]
     where \( f = 0.2 \) is the filling factor.

   - The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{total}}}{F_0} = (1 - f) + f \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4
     \]
     Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{total}}}{F_0} = 0.8 + 0.2 \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4
     \]
     \[
     \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823
     \]
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{total}}}{F_0} \approx 0.8 + 0.2 \times 0.4823 = 0.8 + 0.0965 = 0.8965
     \]
     The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \Delta F = 1 - \frac{F_{\text{total}}}{F_0} = 1 - 0.8965 = 0.1035 \, \text{or} \, 10.35\%
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation Due to a Planet**:
   - When a planet transits the star, the flux dip is proportional to the area of the planet's disk relative to the star's disk:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots (\( \Delta F = 0.1035 \)):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option **D**.
