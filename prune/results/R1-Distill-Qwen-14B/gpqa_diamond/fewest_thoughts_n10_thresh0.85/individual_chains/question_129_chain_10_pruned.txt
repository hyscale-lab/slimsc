Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me break down the reaction steps and the hints to piece this together.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Options are A to D, all cyclic ketones.

Let me start by analyzing the IR data. The strong peak in IR is usually due to carbonyl groups. A peak around 1750 cm^-1 suggests a ketone (since aldehydes are higher, maybe around 1720, but I'm not sure). Wait, no, wait: I think aldehydes have higher wavenumbers than ketones. Wait, correction: Aldehydes are around 1720 cm^-1, ketones around 1700-1750. But 1750 seems high for a ketone; maybe it's an ester or something else. Hmm, but the hint says compound A has that, and E has 1715. Let me think. So A is a carbonyl compound, E is as well, but possibly a different type.

Now, the first reaction: A + HCN → B. Adding HCN usually adds a cyanide group. If A is a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde, then HCN would add to it, forming a cyanohydrin. For example, if A is a ketone, adding HCN would produce a secondary alcohol with a cyanide attached. Wait, but the product would be a cyanohydrin. So B would have a cyanide group and an alcohol group.

Second step: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, probably reducing triple bonds or maybe ketones. Wait, but B has a cyanide group (from HCN addition). So reducing B: HCN adds to a carbonyl to form an alcohol and a CN group. So B would be, say, a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached. When you hydrogenate that, what happens? The CN group is a triple bond. Oh right, H2 with Pd would reduce the nitrile group to an amine. Wait no, nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and Pd become amines. So if B is R-CN and R-OH, then reducing B would give R-CH2-NH2 and R-CH2-OH? Wait, no. Wait, nitriles (R-C≡N) upon hydrogenation (H2, catalyst) become amines: R-CH2-NH2. So if B is, say, a cyclopentanone derivative with a cyanohydrin, then upon reduction, the nitrile becomes a CH2NH2 group, and the alcohol becomes a CH2OH? Or wait, I think when you reduce a nitrile, you add two hydrogens: R-C≡N → R-CH2-NH2. So compound C would have an amine group where the nitrile was, and the hydroxyl group would have been reduced as well? Wait, no. Wait, the first step was HCN adding to carbonyl. So let me think: A is a ketone. Let's say A is cyclopentanone. Then adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin: (cyclopentyl)CH(OH)CN.

Then B is that cyanohydrin. When B is hydrogenated, what happens? The nitrile group will be reduced. So the CN becomes CH2NH2. And the hydroxyl group (-OH) would also be reduced. Wait, but the -OH is part of the cyanohydrin structure, which is an alcohol. So with H2 and Pd, the -OH would become -CH2-OH? No, wait: No, that's not right. Wait, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd typically reduces triple bonds and double bonds. For alcohols, I think you need a more vigorous condition, like high pressure and maybe a different catalyst. But Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds,
