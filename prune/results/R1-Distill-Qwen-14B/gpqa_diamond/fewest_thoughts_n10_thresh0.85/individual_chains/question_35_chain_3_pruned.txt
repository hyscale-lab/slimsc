Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Let me try to think this through step by step.

Okay, the problem says that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is given as h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So, the matrix S looks like:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So, Ay = c * S. Let's compute c*S. Since c is h/(4π), multiplying each element of S by c gives:

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
      [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Hmm, wait. Actually, perhaps it's better to write out the matrix Ay explicitly.

So, the matrix Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                 [i, 0]]

Which simplifies to:

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
      [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Wait, but perhaps I should compute each element explicitly. Let me double-check: the top right element is -i times c, which is -i*(h/(4π)), and the bottom left is i*(h/(4π)). The diagonal elements are zero.

Now, the problem asks for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

Let's write the matrix (Ay - λ I):

[ [ -λ, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [ i*(h/(4π)), -λ ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i*(h/(4π)))(i*(h/(4π))) ]

Simplify the determinant:

= λ² - [ (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, let's compute the product of the off-diagonal elements. The product (-i)(i) is equal to (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. Because i squared is -1, so (-i)*i = -i² = 1.

So, the determinant becomes:

λ² - (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0

So, λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Take square roots: λ = ± h/(4π)

Wait, no. Wait, let me make sure. The determinant is λ² - (h^2/(16 π^2 )) = 0.

So, λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots gives λ = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait a second. Did I compute the product correctly?

Wait, the off-diagonal terms are ( -i*c ) and (i*c ), where c is h/(4π).

So the product is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c². 

Since (-i)(i) equals (-i^2) which is 1, because i^2 is -1, so negative of that is 1.

So the product is 1 * c² = (h/(4π))^2.

So the determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. So λ^2 = h²/(16 π²).

Taking square roots: λ = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. So the eigenvalues are λ = h
