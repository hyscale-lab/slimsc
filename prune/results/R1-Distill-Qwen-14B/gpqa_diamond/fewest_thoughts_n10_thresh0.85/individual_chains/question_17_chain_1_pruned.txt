Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They gave me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 °C. Hmm, right, temperature probably affects the K, but since they gave it to me, I don't need to worry about it.

So, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, and it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is written as CaY²- because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, meaning it binds with six donor atoms. So the formula would be CaY²-.

The concentration given is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution.

Wait, when EDTA complexes with a metal ion, the reaction is something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. But wait, actually, I think the EDTA is in its deprotonated form when it complexes. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + Y^4- ⇌ CaY²-. So the formation constant, Kf, is given by Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But in this problem, the K given is KCa-EDTA, which I think is the formation constant. So KCa-EDTA is the same as Kf here, 5x10^10.

Now, when the solution is at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, is that the only species present? Or are there other things like free EDTA and free Ca²+?

I think the total concentration of EDTA species includes the free EDTA (Y^4-) and the complex (CaY²-). But wait, in this case, the problem states it's a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, so I'm assuming that the initial concentration is just the complex. So [CaY²-] = 0.02 M, and the solution is in such a way that the other species (Ca²+ and Y^4-) are minimal, but we need to calculate their concentrations.

Wait, but wait a second. The formation constant is Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10. So if I have a solution where the concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M, I can set up the equation.

Let me denote [Ca²+] as x and [Y^4-] as y. Then, Kf = 5e10 = (0.02)/(x*y). But I also know that the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. So the total EDTA concentration, [Y_total], is [Y^4-] + [CaY²-]. But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. Hmm, does that mean the total concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M (since each complex has one EDTA), or is it considering the initial amount of EDTA before complexation?

Wait, no, because the complex is 0.02 M. So the concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M. The total EDTA concentration would be [Y^4-] + [CaY²-] assuming that all EDTA is either free or in the complex. But wait, if the initial solution is 0.02 M CaY²-, then the total EDTA (including both free and complex) is 0.02 M. But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. So [CaY²-] = 0.02 M, and the rest is free EDTA and free Ca²+.

But for a very strong complex like EDTA, the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low because Kf is large. So the assumption might be that [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] is negligible compared to that. But wait, the Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable, so [Ca²+] would be very small.

So, let's think about the equation. Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10. So 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * y), where x is [Ca²+] and y is [Y^4-].

But another equation comes from the total EDTA. The total EDTA is [Y_total] = y + 0.02. But wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, then the EDTA in the complex is 0.02 M, and the free EDTA is y. So [Y_total] = y + 0.02. But wait, if the solution has only the complex and not any additional EDTA, perhaps [Y_total] = 0.02 M? That can't be right because in reality, the EDTA is either free or bound. So if the entire solution is 0.02 M of the complex, then the total EDTA is 0.02 M. So y + 0.02 = 0.02 → y=0? That can't be right. So I must have misunderstood.

Wait, no, actually, when the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaY²-.

But in solution, it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-:

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-

So the initial concentrations are:

[CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

[Ca²+] = x

[Y^4-] = y

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small because Kf is large), and Y^4- is y = (something), but perhaps we can make the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02, so [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02.

So Kf = 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * y)

But also, the total EDTA concentration is [Y_total] = y + [CaY²-] = y + 0.02.

But wait, what's the [Y_total]? Because the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-; that would suggest that the total EDTA is 0.02 M. So y + 0.02 = 0.02 → y = 0. That can't be right, because then Kf would be infinite, which it isn't. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Ah, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the solution may also have free EDTA and free Ca²+.

Wait, but the complex is the only source of EDTA and Ca²+? No, because when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and Y^4-.

Wait, no, the complex is present at 0.02 M. So the initial concentrations before dissociation would be [CaY²-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4-] are zero. But then, upon dissociation, some of the complex breaks down into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

But Kf is the formation constant, which is very large, so the reverse reaction (dissociation) is negligible. So the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M, and the concentrations of free Ca²+ and Y^4- are small.

So, Kf = [CaY²-]/( [Ca²+][Y^4-] ) =5e10.

We can write this as 5e10 = 0.02/(x*y), so x*y = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13.

But without another equation, I can't solve for x and y individually. So I need another equation.

The other equation comes from the charge balance or the total concentration of EDTA. Wait, the total EDTA is the sum of free Y^4- and the complex. Because each complex has one EDTA. So:

Total EDTA concentration, C_EDTA = [Y^4-] + [CaY²-] = y + 0.02.

But wait, what is the actual total EDTA? Because the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. So, the total EDTA is 0.02 M, because each formula unit of the complex contributes one EDTA. So perhaps y + 0.02 = 0.02, which would imply y=0, but that
