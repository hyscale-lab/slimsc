Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/parallax^5. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, if I remember correctly. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/d. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's calculate that. 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So I think they're asking, like, the number of stars per unit distance, or the rate of change of number with distance. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of differentials. Or perhaps think about how N depends on the volume, which depends on distance cubed or something.

Wait, wait, another approach. Stars' distribution. If the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, then the total number in a region would depend on the volume. But here, the relation is given as N varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So I think the problem is relating the number of stars to parallax, and we need to find how N changes with distance.

So parallax is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/d), so substituting gives N ∝ d^5. So N increases with the fifth power of distance. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, wait, maybe they're asking for the differential change, like the rate of change dN/dr.

Wait, if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 d^4. But the options don't have a d^4 term, but wait, let me think again. Maybe it's about the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dr at a distance r. So that's like the number of stars in
