Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when it comes to stars, the excitation of atoms is related to their temperature. Oh right, it's something about the Boltzmann distribution or maybe the Saha equation. Wait, but the question mentions that both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann factor here.

The problem says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. I think the excitation depends on the temperature of the star. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, I've heard about the Boltzmann factor determining the population of different energy levels.

The Boltzmann distribution equation is something like n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since we're comparing two energy levels, I can say that for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference.

Wait, but in this problem, the excitation is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. So the ratio (n1/n_ground for star 1) is twice that of star 2. So maybe n1/n2 = 2. No, wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as those in star 2. So perhaps the ratio of the excited to ground state in star 1 is twice that in star 2.

So, let's model this. Let me denote:

For star 1, the ratio is x = (n_excited1) / (n_ground1) = 2 * (n_excited2 / n_ground2) = 2x2.

Wait, no. The question says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So let's say that x1 = 2 x2, where x is the ratio (n_excited / n_ground) for each star.

But wait, no, the problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So
