Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says that X is a meson resonance, and we need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. So, I think this involves some particle physics formulas.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (which is the width Γ) and the time uncertainty (the lifetime τ) is on the order of ħ. So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, is the width Γ the same as the uncertainty in energy? I think so because the width is a measure of the particle's lifetime. So, the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. 

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance should be the product of the particle's velocity and the lifetime. So, mean distance L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity? I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X, I can probably use relativistic mechanics to find its velocity.

The energy E is related to the rest mass and velocity. The total energy E is given by gamma * m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So, E = gamma m c^2. 

Wait, but the production energy is E_X =8 GeV, and the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. Hmm, so E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. But wait, let me check the units. Oh, but wait, in particle physics, energies are often given in GeV, and masses are in GeV/c². So when we write E = gamma m c², the units would work out because E is in GeV, m is GeV/c², so m c² would be GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is approximately 6.6667. That means beta (v/c) can be found from gamma. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Let me compute that. Gamma is 6.6667, which is 20/3. So gamma squared is (400/9) ≈44.444. So 1/gamma squared is 1/44.444 ≈0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887 c.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Maybe I should calculate beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So, 1/gamma^2 = (3^2)/(20^2) )= 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is 0.9887, v = 0.9887 c.

But wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation. Let me think: sqrt(0.9775) is approximately sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887? Let me compute that precisely. 0.9887 squared is 0.9775, yes.

So v ≈0.9887 c.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Let's compute that. But what are the units here? Gamma is given as 320 MeV. So I need to make sure all units are consistent.

Let me convert everything to SI units. So Γ is 320 MeV. 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 320 MeV = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 320 * 1.602e-13 J ≈ 5.1264e-11 J.

Wait, but wait, ħ (h-bar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ. So τ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ) ≈ (1.05457e-34) / (5.
