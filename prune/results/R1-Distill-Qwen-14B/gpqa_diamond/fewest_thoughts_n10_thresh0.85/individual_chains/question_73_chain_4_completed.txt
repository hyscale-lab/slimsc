Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Two astronauts with different masses are moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds, so I guess I need to use special relativity formulas here.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Oh wait, so both are moving in the same direction, but at different speeds. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

First, I need to find the relative speed. Wait, but relative speed in special relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just do a simple subtraction. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, or is it (u' - v')/(1 - (u' v')/c²)? Wait no, let me think. If the two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but with the relativistic formula. So if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, both in the same direction, then the relative speed of A as seen from B is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Because I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) when u and v are in the same direction.

Wait wait, let me get the formula right. The formula for the relative velocity of object u with respect to object v (if v is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, then the velocity u' of u with respect to v is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²))). But since both are moving in the same direction, I'll plug the values into this formula.

So u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. Plugging in, (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. Which is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel around 0.14c. So that's one part.

Next, the total energy of the system. Hmm. Each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, no: the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

Wait, each astronaut's total energy is gamma * m c². So for the system, it would be the sum of each astronaut's energy.

So let me compute each gamma.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.36 c²)/c²) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no. Wait, because wait: the relativistic energy is gamma * m_rest * c². So for the first astronaut, it's gamma1 * (2m) c².

Yes. So E1 = (1.25)(2m c²) = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25 c²)/c²) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² = about 5.964 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. So the total energy should be about 5.96.

So, relative velocity is about 0.14c (option C or D), and total energy is 5.96 mc² (option C). So the correct choice would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Calculating the relative velocity again:

u = 0.6c, v = 0.5c.

(u - v) = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (u v)/c² = 1 - (0.6 * 0.5 c²) / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So rel. speed = (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c ≈ 0.14c. Correct.

Energy calculation:

For astronaut 1: gamma1 = 1.25, E1=2m *1.25 c²= 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: gamma2 = 1/sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(4/3) ≈ 1.1547, so E2=3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Sum: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c², which is 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

So the options are:

Option C: v_rel= 0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

Yes, that's correct.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts moving in the same direction:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
Here, \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.

Answer: C
