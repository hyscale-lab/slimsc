Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on coordination complexes, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the complexes with higher β values will form more readily.

The complexes are Co(SCN)n^2- where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached. The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the Co(SCN)₂²− ion. So, we're looking for the fraction of Co²+ that's in the form of Co(SCN)₂²−.

Wait, but wait. How do the stability constants work here? Stability constants are for the stepwise formation. So, β1 is the constant for the first SCN- addition: Co²+ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)⁺, β1 = [Co(SCN)⁺]/([Co²+][SCN^-]).

Similarly, β2 is the constant for the second SCN- addition: Co(SCN)⁺ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)₂²−, β2 = [Co(SCN)₂²−]/([Co(SCN)⁺][SCN^-]).

Wait, no, sometimes the stability constants are given for the overall formation. So, for the overall formation of Co(SCN)n^2-, the stability constant βn is the product of the stepwise β's. So, β_total for Co(SCN)₂²− would be β1 * β2. Let me think. Because each step is multiplying the previous. So, for n=1, β1. For n=2, β1*β2, n=3 β1*β2*β3, and n=4, β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait, but the given βs are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, the overall stability constants for each complex are:

β1=9 → Co(SCN)²+
β1*β2=9*40=360 → Co(SCN)₂²−
β1*β2*β3=9*40*63= 22680 → Co(SCN)₃^2−
β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16 → let's calculate that. 9
