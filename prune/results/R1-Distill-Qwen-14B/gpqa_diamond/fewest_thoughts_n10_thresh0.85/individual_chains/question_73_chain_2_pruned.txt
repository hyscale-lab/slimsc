Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think it through.

First, the problem says one astronaut has a mass of 2m moving at 0.6c, and another with mass 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, wait. Relative speed in special relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their velocities, right? Because when speeds are a significant fraction of c, you can't just use the classical formula. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at speeds u and v relative to a rest frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c^2)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2)). Let me compute that.

Wait no, let me double-check. The formula I remember is for calculating the velocity of one frame as seen from another. If object A is moving at velocity u in the same direction as object B, which is moving at velocity v, then from B's perspective, A's speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So that's the correct approach.

So plugging in u=0.6c and v=0.5c, so u-v is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that denominator part: 0.3c² /c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. Hmm, 0.14c is close to that. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that's a point to consider.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. Each energy is given by gamma times m c squared. But wait, their masses are different. So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. The second is 3m, moving at 0.5c.

Let me compute gamma for each. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

First astronaut: v=0.6c. So (v²/c²) is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is gamma * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. (v²/c²)=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approx 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈1.1547. So his energy is 1.1547 *3m c² = approx 3.464 mc².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². Hmm, so that's approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. So the energy part matches option C.

Wait, wait, but wait. Did I compute the energies correctly? Let me double-check.

First astronaut: mass 2m, v=0.6c. Gamma is 1.25. So energy E1=1.25 * 2m c²= 2.5 mc². Correct.

Second: mass 3m, v=0.5c. Gamma is 1.1547. So E2=1.1547 *3=3.464. So sum is 5.964, which is about 5.96 mc². So option C has
