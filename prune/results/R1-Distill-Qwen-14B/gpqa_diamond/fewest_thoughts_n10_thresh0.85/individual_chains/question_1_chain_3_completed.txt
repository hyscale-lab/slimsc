Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds.

But wait, the energy difference we're looking for is the difference between E2 and E1, or could it be something else? Hmm, the question is about distinguishing the two energy levels, so the energy difference would need to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainties might overlap, making it hard to resolve them.

So the uncertainty in energy for each state can be calculated using ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). Since ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt, the state with a longer lifetime has a smaller energy uncertainty.

Wait, but each state has its own ΔE. To resolve two states, the energy difference between them (ΔE_total) should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe it's just more than each of their uncertainties? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Let me think. For state 1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1). Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2). The energy difference between the two states, ΔE, should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum, the two levels might not be resolvable. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of each, but I'm not entirely sure.

Let me calculate the individual uncertainties first. Planck's constant ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s. Wait, but the options are in eV. Oh, right, 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 joules. So I can convert ħ into eV·s.

So ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s. 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s². So 1.05e-34 J·s = 1.05e-34 kg·m²/s. But to get eV·s, since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, then 1 J = 1/(1.6e-19) eV. So:

ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s = 1.05e-34 * (1.6e19 eV) * s = 1.05e-34 * 1.6e19 eV·s = (1.05 * 1.6) * 1e-15 eV·s.

Calculating that: 1.05 *1.6 is approximately 1.68. So ħ is approximately 1.68e-15 eV·s.

So, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). Let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

For Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:

ΔE1 = (1.68e-15 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (1.68e-15) / (2e-9) ) eV.

Dividing 1.68e-15 by 2e-9: 1.68/(2) = 0.84, and 1e-15/1e-9 = 1e-6. So ΔE1 is 0.84e-6 eV, which is 8.4e-7 eV.

Similarly for Δt2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = (1.68e-15 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-8 s) ) = (1.68e-15) / (2e-8) ) eV.

1e-15 /1e-8 is 1e-7, so 1.68e-15/(2e-8) = 0.84e-7 eV, which is 8.4e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 8.4e-7 eV and 8.4e-8 eV for the two states.

Now, to distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference (ΔE) between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if ΔE is larger than the sum, the two lines (or energies) would be resolvable. If it's smaller, then the uncertainties would overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So sum of uncertainties: ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 8.4e-7 + 8.4e-8 = 9.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than approximately 9.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is way smaller than 9.24e-7, so no.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller, so no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → that's 1e-4, which is 1e4 *1e-8 → which is much larger than 9.24e-7 (which is 9.24e-7 = 0.924e-6). So 1e-4 is much larger, so yes.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → which is 1e-8, which is less than 9.24e-7. So no.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because maybe I'm mixing up the energy difference. The energy difference between the two states is E2 - E1. Since E2 has a longer lifetime, it's more stable, so its energy is less uncertain. Hmm, but how does the energy difference compare?

Wait, the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2 = 8.4e-8 eV, and E1 is 8.4e-7 eV. So the sum is higher, 9.24e-7.

So the energy difference must be greater than 9.24e-7 eV to be resolvable. So the only option that is larger than that is option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 1e-4. So 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 9.24e-7 (since 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8; 9.24e-7 is 9.24e-7, which is about 9e-7, which is 9e-7. So 1e-4 is 1e4 * larger than 1e-8, but 9e-7 is 90 times larger than 1e-8. So 9e-7 is 0.0000009 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is way bigger than 9e-7 eV. So yes, 1e-4 is much larger, so option C is the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the uncertainty in each state is about 8.4e-7 and 8.4e-8 eV. The sum is about 9e-7. The energy difference must be larger than this sum to distinguish the two levels. So the energy difference Delta E has to be greater than 9e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger (since 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 9e-7). So that's the choice.


To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between them must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties in energy, which is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: 

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For the given lifetimes \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in energy are calculated as:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.68 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s} \), we find:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.68 \times 10^{-15}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 8.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.68 \times 10^{-15}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 8.4 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty in energy is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 8.4 \times 10^{-7} + 8.4 \times 10^{-8} = 9.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A**: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 9.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B**: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 9.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C**: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 9.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D**: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 9.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
