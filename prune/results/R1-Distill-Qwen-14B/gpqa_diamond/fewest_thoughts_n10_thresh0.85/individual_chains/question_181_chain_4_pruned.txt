Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, waitâ€”why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So whatever happens in the Sun's core right now will affect us after about 8.5 minutes. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we're seeing the effects now.

The question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So flux(band1)/flux(band2) is what we're looking for.

I remember that the pp-chain is a major source of solar energy, and it produces neutrinos. The pp-III branch is a part of this chain. So if the pp-III stops, what happens to the neutrino production?

Wait, the pp-chain has several branches. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which primarily produces helium and emits positrons and neutrinos. The pp-III branch is a specific part where a carbon-13 nucleus captures a proton to become nitrogen-14, which then emits a positron and a neutrino. So if this branch stops, that particular source of neutrinos would stop.

But what about the other reactions? The question says all other reactions remained as they were. So other branches of the pp-chain (like pp-I and pp-II) are still active. Also, the CNO cycle is probably still active because it's a different process.

Wait, the CNO cycle is a separate process that produces carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and contributes to energy generation. But I think the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are a smaller fraction of the total solar neutrinos. The majority come from the proton-proton chain.

So, if pp-III stops, what's the impact on the neutrino flux? The pp-III branch contributes to the production of neutrinos. So the neutrino flux would decrease, but how does that affect the different energy bands?

Neutrinos from the pp-III branch have a certain energy spectrum. I think that the neutrinos from the pp chain (including pp-III) have lower energies compared to those from other processes like the CNO cycle. So the CNO neutrinos are higher energy. But wait, I might be getting that wrong. Or perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have a particular energy range.

Wait, the main neutrino production in the proton-proton chain comes from the reaction where a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-8, which then emits a positron and a neutrino. The neutrinos from pp-III are part of this group. So these are the neutrinos that are detected in experiments, like the ones that caused the solar neutrino problem when they were fewer than expected.

If the pp-III branch stops, the total number of neutrinos from the pp chain would decrease. But wait, isn't the pp chain the dominant source? So if a part of it stops, the total neutrino flux would drop, but maybe not completely, since the other parts of the pp chain are still active.

But the question isn't about the total flux; it's about the ratio between two specific energy bands. So band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV. I'm trying to remember the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos.

I think that the majority of the solar neutrinos have energies around a few hundred keV to maybe a couple MeV. The exact distribution depends on the reaction. The pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy ones.

Wait, but let's imagine that
