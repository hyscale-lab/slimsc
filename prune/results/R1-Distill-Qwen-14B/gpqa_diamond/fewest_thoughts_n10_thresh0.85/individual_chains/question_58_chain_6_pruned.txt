Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics (CED).

First, I need to remember what regularization means. From what I recall, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which don't make physical sense. Regularization introduces a temporary modification to the theory to make these infinities manageable, like a way to handle them before they get 'canceled' or absorbed into other parts of the theory.

Now, I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a bit different because it deals with strings vibrating at different frequencies instead of point particles. And I remember that string theories are supposed to be finite or at least not suffer from the same divergences as other quantum field theories. Wait, but isn't string theory supposed to work at high energies without needing things like renormalization? Because it's a theory that claims to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. So maybe it doesn't require regularization because it's inherently free from these divergences. But I'm not entirely sure. I think some versions of string theory have issues with certain limits, but maybe not needing regularization as much as others.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the force between quarks becomes weak. But I also remember that QCD calculations can lead to things like Landau poles or other divergences. So they must use regularization, perhaps through methods like lattice QCD or other techniques. So QCD does require regularization, I think.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory, which means it can handle divergences through renormalization. But does it require regularization? Well, during calculations like loop integrals, you get divergent terms. So to handle that, they use regularization methods such as the Pauli-Villars regularization or dimensional regularization. So QED does require regularization, at least in the calculations. But wait, the theory itself is finite after renormalization, but to get there, you have to regularize first.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics (CED). Classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics, so regularization isn't a concept here. In CED, you deal with Maxwell's equations, and even though you can have singularities (like point charges or infinite potentials), you don't use regularization because that's a quantum field theory concept. So in classical theories, you don't need regularization because it's not part of the framework. So this theory never requires regularization because it's not a quantum theory—so maybe this is the answer.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So I need to think about each theory's behavior at high energies.

For CED, it's a classical theory, so it's not about high energies in the quantum sense. But even so, in the realm of classical physics, you don't use regularization because it's not a quantum effect. So if the question is about whether any of the quantum theories (the options A, B, C) don't need regularization, but D isn't a quantum theory, so it's a candidate.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about which theories are free from needing regularization at high energies. So which of these theories is finite or doesn't have the divergences that require regularization.

Wait, superstring theory: I think it's a theory that doesn't require renormalization because it doesn't have the same kind of divergences. Because in string theory, the interactions are at the string level, and the perturbative expansions don't have the same loop divergences as in QFT. Or wait, maybe they do, but they can be handled without the same kind of regularization. Or perhaps because string theory has a higher number of dimensions, the divergences are less severe or absent. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization. But I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, another thought: QED requires regularization because it's a renormalizable theory, but the divergences can be handled through renormalization. So even though regularization is used, the theory works. But the question is about which theory doesn't require it ever. So if any of the options don't need regularization at any point, including high energies.

Alternatively, perhaps
