Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, the question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the reactions given.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) and NaCN with a reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, they form cyanohydrins. The reaction is usually done in a basic condition because the ketone's carbonyl is attacked by the cyanide nucleophile. But wait, what's the role of the reagent here?

Butan-2-one is a ketone, and adding NaCN (which is a source of CN-) should lead to a nucleophilic addition. The product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. So the structure is something like (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the 2-hydroxy-2-methyl would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons, so the OH and CN are on the same carbon?

Alternatively, the product might be (CH3)C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3? No, maybe I should think of the mechanism. The ketone (butan-2-one) is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, in the work-up, the oxygen is protonated, leading to the formation of an alcohol.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is done with NaCN. So, the reaction is probably a cyanohydrin formation. Under what conditions does that happen? I think it's done under acidic or basic conditions. Oh, right, the formation of cyanohydrin typically uses an acid catalyst. Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which makes the addition of the cyanide ion easier.

So, in the first reaction, reagent A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, reagent A in some choices is H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is an acid source, but it's more commonly used in certain reactions like oxidation or maybe as a buffering agent. But for the cyanohydrin formation, I think you usually use an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or maybe H2SO4. So the first step probably uses an acid (like H3O+ or H2SO4), but looking at the options, reagent A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when you have a ketone reacting with CN- in a basic solution, the work-up might involve acid to protonate the intermediate. Alternatively, sometimes, the reaction is done in a neutral or slightly acidic condition. I'm a bit fuzzy here, so I'll need to think more.

The second reaction is about converting 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile into the corresponding 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, one method is hydrolysis. The typical reagents for this are strong acids like HCl with heat, or perhaps under basic conditions with strong bases followed by acid work-up. Alternatively, using a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the reagent B is H2O. Wait, no: the reaction is with B, which is in parentheses as H2O. So reagent B is H2O, but that canâ€™t be the case. Because nitrile hydrolysis usually needs more than just water. Or wait, maybe it's H2O with another reagent. Alternatively, perhaps B is an acid or base catalyst.

Wait, the second reaction's reagent is B, and the reaction is in H2O. Hmm. So, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. For that, I think the conditions are acidic or basic. Let me recall:
