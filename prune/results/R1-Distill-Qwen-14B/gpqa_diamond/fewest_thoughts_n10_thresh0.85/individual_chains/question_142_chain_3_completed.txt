Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the density matrix ρ given by (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are vectors in 3D space, like (1,1,0) and so on.

Wait, I remember that a density matrix for a qubit can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical way to represent qubit states, right? So any mixed state can be represented as a point within or on the surface.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) that determines the position on the Bloch sphere. The components of r are (x, y, z), and it's constrained such that the magnitude |r| ≤ 1 because the Bloch sphere has a radius of 1.

So given ρ = ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|), I can write this as (I)/2 because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix when you have the computational basis. So ρ = I/2.

Let me write that out. The identity matrix is a 2x2 matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. So ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Now, compare this to the general form (I + r·σ)/2. Let's compute that. The Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So if I have r = (x, y, z), then r·σ is x σx + y σy + z σz. So adding that to I gives:

I + r·σ = [[1 + z, x - iy], [x + iy, 1 - z]]

Then, (I + r·σ)/2 is [[(1+z)/2, (x - iy)/2], [(x + iy)/2, (1 - z)/2]]

Comparing this to the given ρ which is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]], I can set up equations for each element.

So, the diagonal elements of ρ are 0.5. From the general form, the (1,1) element is (1 + z)/2 = 0.5. Solving that gives (1 + z) = 1 → z=0.

Similarly, the (2,2) element is (1 - z)/2 = 0.5. Using z=0, (1-0)/2=0.5, which holds true.

Now, the off-diagonal elements of ρ are zero. So (x - iy)/2 = 0. Which implies x=0 and y=0 because x and y are real numbers. So x=0, y=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,z). But z is 0, so r=(0,0,0). Oh wait, but wait a second. The vector (0,0,0) would correspond to the completely mixed state, right? Because when r is zero, the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which is the maximally mixed state.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.

Let me double-check. If the density matrix is I/2, that's the maximally mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere, so r=0. Yep, that makes sense. The other options don't fit. For example, option A is (1,1,0), which would mean a state on the Bloch sphere's surface, but the given ρ is not a pure state. So the only option that makes sense is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z = 0\). 

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the maximally mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, only \(r = (0, 0, 0)\) matches this result.
