Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, the question is about the excitation of iron atoms in two stars' photospheres and how that relates to their effective temperatures. I remember something about the Boltzmann equation from my studies, which deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium. Since the problem says both photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), that must be the key here.

So, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, the number of atoms in a higher energy level compared to a lower one. So, if star_1 has twice as many excited atoms, the ratio of excited to non-excited is 2:1. But wait, the question says "twice as excited", which I think refers to the population ratio, not the energy itself.

The Boltzmann equation is given by (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, n_i is the number of atoms in state i, and g_i is the degeneracy. Let's say E_i is the higher energy level and E_j is the lower. So, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

In this case, for star_1, the ratio is 2, and for star_2, perhaps it's different. Wait, no. Wait, the observed ratio is that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, for star_1, the ratio (n_i / n_j) is 2, and for star_2, that ratio is, let me think, let me denote it as R. So, I need to relate the temperatures T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the populations for each star. Let me denote for star 1: n1_i / n1_j = 2, and for star 2: n2_i / n2_j = something else. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, probably, the ratio of excited to non-excited in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So if star_1's ratio is R1 and star_2's ratio is R2, then R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, maybe the excitation is higher for star_1. So, the population in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. But wait, the energy levels are the same for both stars, right? Because the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is the same for both stars. So, the same ΔE applies to both.

So, for each star, the ratio of excited to non-excited is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote the ratio for star 1 as R1 and for star 2 as R2.

So, R1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )
R2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

But the problem says that R1 = 2 * R2. Because star_1's atoms are twice as excited. Hmm, wait, actually, maybe it's the other way around. Because being "twice as excited" might mean that the number of excited atoms is twice as high. So, R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose in star_1, the excited state population is twice that of star_2. So, R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio in star_1 is 2 compared to the ratio in star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1, but the non-excited is the same? No, probably not. Because we're talking about the ratio within each star. So, for each star, the population of the excited state relative to the ground state is R1 and R2 respectively.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, but from the Boltzmann equation:

R1 = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
R2 = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

So, if R1 = 2 R2, then:

(g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T
