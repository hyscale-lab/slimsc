Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that the brightness of the star matters because each spectrograph has different magnitude limits.

The question gives me some details about each star, like their RA, DEC, magnitudes, distances, and some have extinction values. Oh wait, extinction is the dimming caused by dust, right? So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star, considering that extinction, to see if they fall within the detection limits of both instruments.

Let me look at the parameters again. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, so apparent mag less than 17. HIRES can see up to 16 mag, so apparent mag less than 16.5? Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, magnitude scale is a bit tricky. Lower numbers are brighter. So a star with apparent V mag of 16 is brighter than 17. So for a star to be observable by both, its apparent V mag must be <=16 (since HIRES can go down to 16, but wait, the question says "brighter than 16 V mag" for HIRES. So if a star's apparent V is, say, 16.5, HIRES can't see it. So I think for a star to be detected by both, its apparent mag must be <=16.

Wait, no, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So brighter than 17 means apparent mag <17? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, for a star to be detected by ESPRESSO, apparent V mag must be less than 17. For HIRES, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16 can be observed, so apparent mag <16.

So the star must have apparent V mag less than 16 to be seen by both. Because if a star is brighter than 16 (apparent mag <16), both can observe it. If it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can, but not HIRES. So the key is to find which stars have apparent mag <=
