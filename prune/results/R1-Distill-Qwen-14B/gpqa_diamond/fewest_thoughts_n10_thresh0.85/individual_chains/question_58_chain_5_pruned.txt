Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are like infinities that pop up in calculations. These divergences can cause problems because you can't have an infinite result in a physical measurement. So regularization is a way to handle these infinities, right?

Wait, but the question is about which theory never needs regularization. So maybe some theories are finite, meaning they don't have these divergences, so regularization isn't necessary.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory deals with strings as fundamental particles instead of point particles. Because strings have length scales, maybe it handles some aspects more smoothly. But I'm not sure if it avoids divergences entirely. I recall that string theory might have different kinds of divergences but perhaps in a different way. Or maybe it's a theory that is more naturally quantized and avoids some of the problems that other QFTs have. But I'm not certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, which leads to things like asymptotic freedom. At high energies, the coupling becomes weak, so perturbative methods work. But does QCD require regularization? I think yes, because even though it's asymptotically free, loop diagrams can still have divergences. So you'd need to regularize, maybe using methods like lattice regularization or others.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a U(1) gauge theory. I remember that QED has divergent loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy. So you need to regularize these to get finite results. The renormalization process comes in, which involves subtracting the infinities. But that implies regularization is needed. So QED does require regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, that's the non-quantum version. Classical ED is a set of equations like Maxwell's equations. But in classical theory, do you have divergences? Like, in point charges, the electric field at the origin is infinite. But that's more of a mathematical issue with point particles. But does it require regularization? I don't think so because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. In classical theories, you might have singularities, but you don't use regularization techniques. Instead, you might smooth things out with models like the Dirac delta function for charge distributions.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. Well, in the high-energy limit, quantum theories are needed. But classical theories don't involve quantization, so they don't have the same divergences as in QFT. So for classical ED, you don't regularize because you're not doing QFT. So the theory doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory.

So the question is, which theory never requires regularization. So the options are about when they are used at high energies. Let me think again.

Superstring theory is a quantum theory, so it might need regularization in its calculations, but maybe it's free of some divergences. Wait, I think string theory is supposed to be finite. Because in string theory
