Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let's think.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember something about the Boltzmann equation relating the population of energy levels to temperature. The Boltzmann factor, right?

The Boltzmann equation is probably relevant here. The formula is something like N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where N_i and N_j are the populations of two energy levels, g is the statistical weight, E the energy, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

In this case, they're looking at the same transition in both stars, so the energy difference ΔE is the same for both, which is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the ratio of excitation is N1/N2 = 2 for the same element under LTE (local thermal equilibrium).

Wait, but wait—the ratio is for the same element in two different stars. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state (or some other state) is given by their respective temperatures.

Let me model this step by step.

For star_1: N1_excited / N1_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2: N2_excited / N2_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that the excitation is twice as much in star_1, so N1/N2 = 2. Wait, but the ratio given is between the two stars. So (N1_excited / N1_ground) / (N2_excited / N2_ground ) = 2.

So substituting the equations:

[ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] ) = 2

Wait, but I think the statistical weights g_excited and g_ground are same for both stars, so they'd cancel out. So the ratio becomes exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) + ΔE/(k T2) )) ) = 2.

Wait, let me re-arrange that exponent:

exp( [ΔE/(k) ] (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2.

Taking the natural log on both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, so rearrange terms:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE

Wait, let's compute that. Wait, but the question is about the equation between T1 and T2. Let's see, let's rearrange the equation:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln 2

Which can be written as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln 2) * k / ΔE

But wait, I don't think I need to compute the actual numerical value since the options don't have any numbers. So the equation is:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

But wait no, because when I move terms, it's (1/T2 -1/T1) = (ln 2) * (k/ΔE)

Wait, the way I have it, the equation is:

(1/T2 -1/T1) = (ln 2) * (k/ΔE )

But wait the question is asking for an equation between T1 and T2. So perhaps it's better to express in terms of T1 and T2.

Alternatively, let me reorganize:

Let me write the equation:

(ΔE)/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln 2) * (k)/(ΔE )

But if I factor 1/T, perhaps. Alternatively, I can write this as:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = (ln 2) * (k / ΔE )

But the problem gives us ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, and k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, wait, because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So if ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, then k/ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = 1/K.

So substituting that:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (1/K) * K? Wait no, wait (k/ΔE) is (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) ) → 1/K? Wait, no:

Wait, k is 1.38e-23 J/K. ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

So k/ΔE would be (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) → (1/K) * (J/J) → 1/K → yes.

So (1/T2 -1
