Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they should react in a neutralization reaction.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh right, dilution changes the concentration. So first, I need to find the new concentration after mixing.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. To find the moles of acetic acid, moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. Oh, so the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Got it, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me tackle each part.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid we have is 0.001 (from earlier). Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the problem says to find the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but for the equivalence point, the solution will be the sodium acetate, which comes from the neutralization. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, the sodium acetate (its conjugate base) will hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic. So I'll need to calculate the pH using the Kb from the Ka of acetic acid.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The concentration of acetate comes from the moles of acetate divided by the total volume. Let me see.

So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001. At equivalence, that's all converted to 0.001 moles of acetate (CH3COO^-). The total solution volume is the initial 40 cm³ (20+20) plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH (since at equivalence, we added 10 cm³). So 50 cm³ total. So concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, Kb is Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. So the acetate ion will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Let x be [OH^-]. So initial is 0.02 M acetate. At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, because Kb is very small. So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02. So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11. Then x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ around 4.98. So pH is 14 -4.98 = 9.02? Wait, but the options don't have 9.02. Hmm maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up Kb or the concentration.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol in 50 cm³ (0.05 L) → 0.02 M. Correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so 4.983. So pH is 14 -4.983=9.017 approximately 9.02. But none of the options have a pH near 9 at equivalence. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B)3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, the equivalence point pH in the options are 8.52, 6.73,7.00,6.92. So my calculated 9.02 is not matching. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the volume. Let's recheck: original volume is 40 cm³ (20+20). At equivalence, we add 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³, correct.

Wait, maybe I forgot that during the reaction, the acetate comes from a strong base, so the solution is not just the acetate ion but also the sodium ions. Oh wait, sodium ions are spectator ions, so no issue. So the concentration calculation is right.

Hmm, maybe I miscalculated the Kb. Let me compute it again. 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = approx 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I should consider activity coefficients, but I think that's beyond what's expected here.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles are different. Let me recheck the initial setup.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001. Correct. Then diluted with 20 cm³ water, making 40 cm³, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is when considering the equivalence point, the solution is 0.02 M acetate in 0.05 L (50 cm³). So yeah, correct.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. x is sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5. pH is 14 - (pOH=4.983) ≈ 9.017. But none of the options have a pH near 9. Hmm, the closest option is A, which says equivalence pH is 8.52.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Or perhaps I should calculate the pH using a buffer equation instead. Wait, no, at equivalence point, it's just the acetate ion.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should account for the dilution of the acetate when adding NaOH. Oh wait, no, because the NaOH is a strong base; all the acid is neutralized, and the solution is a solution of the conjugate base. So the concentration should be correct.

Wait, maybe I'll recalculate the exact Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.

So, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is [OH^-], then [CH3COOH] is x, and [CH3COO^-] is approx 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, Kb = x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x = 1.04e-5.

So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is 4.98 → pH is 9.02.

But none of the options have a pH around 9, but option D is 6.92 at equivalence point, which is lower than 7. Hmm, that's strange.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation. Let me think differently. Maybe the initial moles are wrong?

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the moles are same, volume is 40 cm³ → 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence: 0.001 mol of acetate in 50 cm³ → 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate, which is a salt from a weak acid and strong base. So the pH should be basic, but my calculation says pH ~9.02, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to consider the dilution effect during titration, but no, at equivalence, the volume is fixed.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the initial approach. Let's think again. Oh wait, maybe the solution is not 50 cm³ because the volumes are additive? Let me think: when you mix 40 cm³ of solution with 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total is 50 cm³. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong Kb value. Wait, let me compute the Kb more precisely.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

Compute 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

1 / 1.85 ≈ 0.5405405405. So Kb ≈ 5.405405e-10.

So x^2 = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5 → [OH-] = 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5). Let me compute log(1.04e-5):

log(1.04) ≈ 0.017.

So log(1.04e-5) = -5 + 0.017 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983 → pH is 9.017.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I can compute [OH^-] accurately. Let's compute x^2 = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02.

5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

Take square root: sqrt(1.08108e-11) = x.

Let me compute sqrt(1.08108e-11). Let's express 1.08108e-11 as 1.08108 × 10^-11.

The square root of 1.08108 is approximately 1.04, because 1.04^2 = 1.0816, which is close to 1.08108.

So x ≈ 1.04e-5. So yes.

So pH ≈ 9.02. But the options don't have this. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up the initial dilution. Let me recheck the initial setup.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then 20 cm³ water is added, making it 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.025 M. Then, when adding NaOH, the volume is 40 + V_NaOH. But to find pH at 25% titration, I don't think the equivalence point is needed for that part.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to calculate the pH at 25% titration first, then maybe the equivalence point calculation will make more sense.

So, 25% titration. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³, as calculated earlier. 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, in the solution, we have some acetic acid and some acetate ions.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is initial 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) → log(1.85e-5) → log(1.85)=0.267, so pKa = 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. Approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 for the first part. So the pH at 25% titration is about 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? Earlier, I got pH around 9.02, but none of the options have that. Let me look again at the options. Option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is acidic. That can't be right because equivalence point of a weak acid and strong base should be basic.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the acetate ion comes from a weak acid, so its solution is basic. But the options don't have a high pH. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, let me compute 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

1 / 1.85 = approximately 0.54054.

So, Kb = 5.4054e-10.

So, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M → Kb expression: x²/(0.02) = 5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x = 1.04e-5 → [OH-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.983 → pH=9.017.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong initial moles.

Wait, let me recompute the moles at equivalence point. Original acetic acid was 0.001 mol. At equivalence, all of it is converted to acetate, so 0.001 mol acetate.

Volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ =50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not at 25% titration, but I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, let me think about the other part again. So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26, which matches option A's first value. Then, the equivalence point is around 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I assumed that the solution at equivalence is 0.02 M acetate, but perhaps the actual volume is different.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the diluted acetic acid's concentration.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles acetic acid = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³ → 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So when titrating, the moles of NaOH needed: 0.001 mol. Because the reaction is 1:1. So volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³.

So the total volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 cm³. So 0.05 L. Correct.

Hmm, this is perplexing. The pH at equivalence point is around 9.02, but none of the options match. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: 4.57;6.92 → equivalence pH is 6.92, which is below 7. That can't be correct for acetic acid titration.

Wait, another approach, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach for the equivalence point. Maybe I should consider that the solution is a buffer at equivalence? No, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me use exact calculation.

Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) ×1e-9 → 0.5405405e-9 → 5.405405e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So, the hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression: ( [CH3COOH][OH^-] ) / [CH3COO^-] = Kb.

Let x be the [OH^-]. So:

x^2 / (0.02 – x) = 5.4054e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 – x ≈0.02.

So x^2 ≈5.4054e-10 * 0.02 → 1.08108e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5 → [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.017.

So, I'm confident about this, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is that the solution is not 0.02 M acetate. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the concentration before adding NaOH, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the pH using a different approach, like the initial concentration without considering the dilution.

Wait, let me think again. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, 20 cm³ of water is added, making it 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid is neutralized to 0.001 mol of acetate, and the solution is 0.05 L (50 cm³) → 0.02 M acetate.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to find the pH at 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 2.5 cm³. So I have 25% of the way to equivalence.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, as before, moles of acetic acid remaining is 0.00075, and moles of acetate is 0.00025.

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.733. The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) )= 1/3 ≈0.333.

So log(0.333)= -0.477 → pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256. So approximately 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

Now, perhaps the equivalence point is being miscalculated, but I can't find the error. Maybe the options have a typo, but that's unlikely.

Looking at the options, option A says pH 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence.

Wait, how could the equivalence pH be 8.52? That's lower than 9, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: maybe the solution at equivalence is not 0.02 M acetate. Let me recheck.

Wait, moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. Volume is 50 cm³ → 0.05 L. 0.001 /0.05= 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it using exact expression without approximation.

So Kb =5.405e-10.

x^2 = Kb * C =5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

Wait, perhaps the exact value is important.

But the pH is about 9.02, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the problem intended to consider that the solution is 0.02 M, but maybe the Ka is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact calculation without assuming x is negligible.

Let me set up the equation:

x² / (0.02 -x) =5.4054e-10.

Assume x≈1.04e-5, so 0.02 -x ≈0.019996.

So x² =5.4054e-10 * (0.019996) → approximately 1.0809e-11. x≈1.04e-5. So same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem didn't dilute the acetic acid. Let me see what would happen if we didn't dilute.

Original solution is 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles=0.001. Dilution: no, the question says we do dilute with 20 cm³ water. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach for the equivalence point. Maybe it's considering the solution as a buffer? No, at equivalence it's just acetate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to calculate the half-equivalence point. No, because 25% is earlier than that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let's double-check.

Initial volume:20 cm³ 0.05 M → 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³, total volume 40 cm³ → 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 =0.025 M.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when adding 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to make a different assumption, like the solution is not at 25°C, but the question says 25°C, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 0.02 M, but the pH is lower.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem used the concentration before adding NaOH, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different Ka value. Let me see, if I use Ka=1.8e-5, what would happen?

Ka=1.8e-5 → pKa=4.7447.

Henderson equation at 25%:

pH =4.7447 + log( (0.00025)/(0.00075) ) → same ratio 1/3 → pH=4.7447-0.477≈4.267. So same as before.

At equivalence, pKa=4.7447, but the solution is basic.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The only option where the first pH is around 4.26 is option A (4.26;8.52). But our calculation for equivalence is 9.02, but option A says 8.52.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me try to compute it more accurately.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5 =5.405405405e-10.

So [OH-]=√(5.4054e-10 *0.02 )

→ √(1.08108e-11)=1.04e-5.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute pH more accurately.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5)=?

Let me compute log(1.04)=0.0170.

So, log(1.04e-5)= log(1.04) + log(1e-5)=0.0170 + (-5)= -4.983.

So pOH=4.983 → pH=14-4.983=9.017.

So, no, it's correct.

But none of the options have 9.02. So perhaps the problem expects an answer that's not matching my calculations, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't just acetate, but also some unreacted acetic acid? No, at equivalence, all acetic acid is neutralized.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for options that have the correct pH at 25% titration. So option A has 4.26, which matches our calculation.

So, even though the equivalence point doesn't match, perhaps the correct answer is option A, assuming I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the pH after 25% of the initial concentration, but that's not what was asked.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the same concentration without considering the dilution. Let me see. Suppose I didn't dilute the acetic acid, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem asks for the pH at 25% of the initial concentration, but that's not what the question says.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the initial moles.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. 0.05 M ×0.02 L=0.001 mol. Correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using a different approach to calculate the pH at equivalence.

Wait, when acetate is dissolved in water, it forms a basic solution. The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + ½ (pKw - pKa)

Wait, no, that's for a different scenario. Alternatively, the pH can be calculated as:

pH = (pKa + pKw - pKa) / 2 → (14)/2=7. But that's for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base at equivalence. Wait, no, that formula is for the pH when the concentration is such that [A-]=[HA], but that's the half equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the pH at equivalence can be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + log ( (C) / sqrt(Ka * C) )

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, when you have a solution of a weak base (like acetate), the pH is given by:

[OH-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

So, in this case, C=0.02 M, Kb=5.405e-10.

So [OH-] = sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10 )= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 → pH=9.02.

So I think my calculation is correct. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is about 25% titration of the diluted solution. Let me recheck that part.

Wait, the diluted solution is 0.025 M. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. Which gives 0.00025 mol of NaOH.

So, moles of CH3COOH =0.00075, CH3COO^- =0.00025.

Concentration of CH3COOH =0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^- =0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH= pKa + log (0.005882/0.017647)= pKa + log(0.333)=4.733-0.477=4.256 → 4.26. So correct.

So, the pH at 25% is 4.26, which matches option A.

But the equivalence pH isn't matching any option. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Kb. Let me compute it exactly.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5.

Compute 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 ≈0.5405405405.

So, 0.5405405405e-9 → 5.405405405e-10.

So Kb is correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, even though the equivalence pH doesn't match. Or perhaps I've made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial dilution is 20 cm³ +20 cm³ → 40 cm³, but the moles are 0.001, so 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, 0.001 mol of acetate in 50 cm³ → 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to ignore activity coefficients and use a different approach, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula for a weak base: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C). So:

[OH-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) =1.04e-5 → pH=9.02.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use a different concentration. Let me check if the initial concentration after dilution is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the diluted solution is 20 cm³ +20 cm³ =40 cm³, but the initial moles are 0.05 M ×0.02 L =0.001 mol. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option D, which has 4.57 at 25%, but that doesn't match what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial dilution. Let me recalculate the concentration after dilution.

20 cm³ of 0.05 M → moles=0.001.

Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.04 L.

Concentration=0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the initial concentration before dilution for the equivalence calculation. Let me try that.

If I didn't dilute, the concentration is 0.05 M, and the equivalence volume would be 0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L →10 cm³. Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, no, because without dilution, the volume is 20 cm³, so after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total is 30 cm³.

So [acetate] =0.001 /0.03 L=0.03333 M.

Then, Kb =5.405e-10.

[OH-]= sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.03333)=sqrt(1.8017e-11)=4.245e-6 → pOH=5.37 → pH=8.63.

Hmm, which is close to option A's equivalence pH of 8.52.

But wait, why would the problem not dilute the acetic acid? The question clearly states that it was diluted with 20 cm³ of water.

So that's not the case. So I'm back to square one.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the solution is not 50 cm³ at equivalence. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps during the titration, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and the NaOH is added to that. So the volumes are additive, leading to 50 cm³.

But earlier calculation would still lead to 0.02 M acetate.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps I should look for the option that has the correct pH at 25% titration, which is option A, even though the equivalence pH doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation and should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula for a buffer at equivalence? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at equivalence as the pKa of the buffer solution. But that's not correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the same concentration for both parts, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to select option A, given that the 25% pH matches.

But then the equivalence pH is around 9.02, which isn't in the options. So perhaps there's a miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence is not 0.02 M, but perhaps considering that some of the NaOH is in excess.

Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so no excess.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use the same concentration for both parts, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the equivalence point, but that's not applicable because all the acid is neutralized.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given that the pH at 25% is 4.26, which matches option A, perhaps the intended answer is A, with equivalence pH 8.52, but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5=5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact values without approximation.

So, for the equivalence point:

[CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

The reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Let x be [OH^-].

At equilibrium, [CH3COOH]=x, [CH3COO^-]=0.02 –x.

So, Kb = (x)(0.02 –x)/ (0.02 –x) )=x²/(0.02 –x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 –x ≈0.02.

So x² =5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

So, I'm confident about this.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that at equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate, and the pH is calculated using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

But at equivalence, [A^-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is negligible, so pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])= pKa + log(0.02/0). Hmm, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a weak base:

pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )

But at equivalence, [HA] is zero, which is undefined.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression for [OH-].

Equation: x² = Kb * (0.02 – x) → x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 –x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 –x ≈0.02.

So x≈sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

So, [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pH=9.02.

I think I'm stuck. The correct pH at 25% is 4.26, which is option A. So perhaps despite the discrepancy at equivalence, the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid with NaOH, focusing on the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Initial Setup and Dilution
- **Initial acetic acid solution**: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains moles of acetic acid:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:  
  \[
  \text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 2: Titration and pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added.  
- **Equivalence volume of NaOH**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of NaOH required} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}, \quad \text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
  \]
  Thus, 25% of the equivalence volume is:  
  \[
  0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
  \]
- **Moles of NaOH added at 25% titration**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Reaction**: Acetic acid reacts with NaOH in a 1:1 molar ratio. After 25% titration:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
  \]
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \, \text{(acetate)} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Total volume at 25% titration**:  
  \[
  \text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentrations**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **pH at 25% titration**: Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
  \]
  where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, (\text{approximately } 4.26).
  \]

### Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.  
- **Moles of acetate**: \(0.001 \, \text{mol}\).  
- **Total volume**: \(40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}\).  
- **Concentration of acetate**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **pH at equivalence point**: Acetate is a weak base, and its hydrolysis in water is governed by:  
  \[
  \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
  \]
  The base dissociation constant \(K_b\) is:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
  \]
  Using the formula for \([OH^-]\):  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies [OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5}.
  \]
  The pOH is:  
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
  \]
  The pH is:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
  \]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
- The pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\), which matches the first value in **Option A**.  
- The calculated pH at the equivalence point is \(9.02\), but none of the options provide this value. The closest option for the equivalence point is \(8.52\) in **Option A**.

Given that the pH at 25% titration matches **Option A**, and assuming the equivalence point value in the options is approximate, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
