Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically involving a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are the interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The options are A to D, with various values.

Wait, first, I need to recall what a rhombohedral crystal structure is. I remember that a rhombohedron is a type of crystal lattice where all edges are of equal length, and all angles are equal. So it's like an extension of the cubic system but with angles that aren't necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, all the angles are 30 degrees, which is quite a deviation from the cubic structure.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. But wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice. But in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell has all sides equal, say 'a', and all angles equal. So I think the interatomic distance here is the edge length of the unit cell, which is 'a'. So a = 10 Angstroms.

Now, the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula from crystallography for the (hkl) planes. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + kl + lh) * (cosθ)/(1 - cosθ) ), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is a bit different because of the non-orthogonal angles.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but in a rhombohedral system, which has non-90-degree angles, the formula must be adjusted. Oh right, because the Miller indices (hkl) relate to the reciprocal lattice
