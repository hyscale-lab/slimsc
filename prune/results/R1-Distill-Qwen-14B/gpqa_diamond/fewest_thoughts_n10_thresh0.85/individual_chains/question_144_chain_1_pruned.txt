Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about meson resonances and their decay distance. I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance is related to their properties like energy, mass, and width. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas, so let me think.

The question gives me X as a meson resonance. They provide the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are all different distances in the order of 10^-15 or -16 meters. So I need to find the mean decay distance.

I recall that the mean lifetime (tau) of a particle is related to its width via the uncertainty principle. The formula is something like tau ≈ ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and Γ is the width. But wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Oh right, Γ is the decay width, which is the total width of the resonance. So the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the decay distance. Decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime, right? So the formula would be distance = v * tau, where v is the velocity.

But wait, the particle's energy is given, so I need to find its velocity from that. Hmm. The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So I can find gamma from E and m.

Wait, the E given is production energy. So E_X is 8 GeV, and mass is 1.2 GeV. Okay, so let's compute gamma (γ) as E/(m c²), but since the units are in GeV and m_X is in GeV/c², I think the c² would cancel out because E is in GeV, which is energy, so E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But since E and m are both in GeV and GeV/c² respectively, let's see: m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², so E = gamma * m_X * c² → gamma = E / (m_X c²) → but the c² would be (c^2) in m²/s², but maybe it's easier to compute beta and gamma using the energy.

Alternatively, since in particle physics units, c is often set to 1, but I need to be careful with units. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1, but since the answer requires meters, I have to convert properly.

Wait, maybe I should compute the velocity beta (v/c) first. The relation between energy and velocity comes from the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Energy squared equals (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. Solving for p, we get p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c. Then, since p = gamma m v, and v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to find beta using the relation between energy, mass, and velocity. Let's see, in natural units where c=1, E = gamma m, and p = gamma beta m. But maybe I can find beta gamma from the energy.

Alternatively, since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v, and v = beta c. So, p = gamma m beta c. So then, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Substituting p, we get E² = (gamma^2 m^2 beta^2 c²) * c² + (m^2 c^4) → E² = gamma² m² beta² c^4 + m² c^4. But E = gamma m c², so E² = gamma² m² c^4. So substituting, we have:

gamma² m² c^4 = (gamma² m² beta² c^4) + (m² c^4)

Divide both sides by m² c^4:

gamma² = gamma² beta² + 1

So gamma² (1 - beta²) = 1 → gamma² (1 - beta²) = 1 → since 1 - beta² = (1)/(gamma²), but wait, maybe I can find beta in terms of gamma.

Wait, alternatively, beta can be found as follows: beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2). Let me see: from E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 → p c = sqrt(E² - (m c^2)^2) → p = sqrt(E² - (m c^2)^2)/c. Then, since p = gamma m v, and v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c → so sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c = gamma m beta c → sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c² = gamma m beta → sqrt( (E/c²)^2 - m^2 ) / c^2 = gamma m beta.

Wait I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should use the formula for beta in terms of E and m. Let me compute beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2). But let me make sure about the units.

Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c². So when I compute m c², it would be (1.2 GeV/c²) * c² = 1.2 GeV. So E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E >> m c², so beta is approximately 1, but let's compute it accurately.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2 GeV / 8 GeV)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887 times c.

So the velocity v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, the next step is to find the lifetime. The mean lifetime tau is given by tau = ħ / (Γ). Because the decay width Γ is related to the uncertainty in energy, and the uncertainty in time is the mean lifetime. So Γ ≈ ħ / tau → tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is given in MeV. I need to make sure the units are compatible. ħ is in J·s, but MeV is energy. So I'll need to convert Γ into J to compute tau.

First, let's find ħ in J·s. ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

Γ is 320 MeV. 1 eV is 1.60218 × 10^-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320 × 10^6 eV. So Γ = 320e6 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J.

Calculating that: 320e6 = 3.2e8, so 3.2e8 * 1.60218e-19 = 3.2 * 1.60218e-11 = approx 5.126976e-11 J.

So Gamma = 5.126976e-11 J.

Now, tau = ħ / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.126976e-11 J) = (1.0545718e-34) / (5.126976e-11) s.

Calculating that division: 1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 = approx 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately: 1.0545718 /5.126976 ≈ 0.2056. So 0.2056e-23 → 2.056e-24 seconds. So tau ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay distance is v * tau. v is approximately 0.9887 c. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So the distance is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s.

Calculating that: 3e8 * 2.056e-24 = 6.168e-16 m. Multiply by 0.9887: 6.168e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.107e-16 m.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did the calculation correctly.

Wait, 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s is approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.056e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056) * 1e-16.

2.966 * 2.056 ≈ approx 6.107. So 6.107e-16 m.

Wait, so the distance is approximately 6.107e-16 meters. Looking at the options, the choices are around 4e-15, 5e-15, etc. Wait, but that's nowhere near any of the options. Hmm, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me go back and check my steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of Gamma. Let me re-calculate Gamma in J.

Gamma is 320 MeV. 1 MeV is 1e6 eV. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV.

Each eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 = ?

320e6 = 3.2e8.

3.2e8 * 1.60218e-19 = 3.2 * 1.60218 = 5.126976 → 5.126976e-11 J. So that part was correct.

Then tau = ħ / Gamma = 1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 → let me compute that again.

1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 = (1.0545718 /5.126976) * 1e-23.

1.0545718 /5.126976 ≈ 0.2056.

So 0.2056e-23 seconds → 2.056e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Wait, then
