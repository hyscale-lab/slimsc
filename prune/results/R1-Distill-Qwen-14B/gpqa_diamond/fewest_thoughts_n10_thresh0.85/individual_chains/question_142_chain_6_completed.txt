Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this looks familiar. Oh right, when a qubit is in a completely mixed state, its density matrix is like that. So ρ is a completely mixed state, meaning the qubit is in a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states with equal probability.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position. I'm trying to remember how density matrices are represented in the Bloch sphere. Oh, right! The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector) with components r_x, r_y, r_z. The length of r cannot exceed 1 because the density matrix must be positive semi-definite.

So let's compute r for the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute that matrix. |0⟩ is [1,0]^T, so |0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, yes. Because (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) is the identity matrix I. So ρ is I/2. Now, the standard form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set that equal to ρ, which is I/2, then (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides, we get r·σ / 2 = 0. So r·σ = 0 matrix.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

If r·σ is the zero matrix, that implies that each component must be zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That makes sense because the state is completely mixed; it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, let me make sure. So a pure state has |r|=1, right? For example, |0⟩ would be (0,0,1). A completely mixed state would be the maximally mixed state, which is I/2, so r is zero. So the geometrical position is at the origin in the Bloch sphere. So the answer should be option C, which is r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. The length of \(\mathbf{r}\) must satisfy \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\) to ensure the density matrix is positive semi-definite.

For the given \(\rho\), we observe that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form \(\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), it follows that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) (i.e., \(r_x\), \(r_y\), and \(r_z\)) must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the completely mixed state being at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin.
