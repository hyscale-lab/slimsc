Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, denoted as Ay. They give that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and that it's equal to c multiplied by S. Oh, right, c is h/(4π). And S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Oh right, S here must be proportional to sigma_y. Because the structure of S matches sigma_y which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]] if I'm not mistaken. Wait, no, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], yes? So S is actually sigma_y multiplied by something. Wait, looking back, the given S is exactly the sigma_y matrix. Because sigma_y is:

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

So that's exactly S. So S is sigma_y. So Ay is c multiplied by sigma_y, which is (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

But wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. So sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when we multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1), so ± h/(4π). Wait, but let me think again.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So the eigenvalues a are c times the eigenvalues of S. Since S is sigma_y, which has eigenvalues ±1, so a would be c * (±1), which is h/(4π) * (±1), so a = ± h/(4π). So the possible eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check which option matches this. Let's see the options:

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh and the real part ±h/(4π). That doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are real. Wait, eigenvalues of Ay would be real? Because sigma_y's eigenvalues are real? Wait no, wait, sigma_y has eigenvalues ±i? Or is it ±1? Wait no, wait. I'm getting confused. Wait, the Pauli matrices: sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z all have eigenvalues ±1. Wait no, wait. Actually, their eigenvalues are ±1. Because, for example, sigma_x has eigenvalues 1 and -1. Similarly for sigma_y and sigma_z. So S here is sigma_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. So when we multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * 1 and c * (-1), so h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers.

Looking at the options again:

Option A suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which doesn't make sense because Ay is a Hermitian operator. Since angular momentum components are Hermitian, their eigenvalues should be real. So that rules out options that suggest imaginary parts in the eigenvalues.

Option B: The imaginary part is ±1/2
