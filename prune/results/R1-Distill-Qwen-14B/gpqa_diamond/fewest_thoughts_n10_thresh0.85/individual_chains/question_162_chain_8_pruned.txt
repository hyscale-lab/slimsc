Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So this looks like a 2-dimensional metric, right? It's expressed in terms of x and y, so maybe we're dealing with a surface embedded in some space.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is like the hyperbolic plane, but maybe here it's embedded in a specific way.

Wait, the metric provided seems to have a denominator (4 - x² - y²), which is similar to the metric of a sphere but with a negative curvature. Let me recall: the standard metric for a sphere is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²/R²), but that's for the outer spacetime, like Schwarzschild. Wait, no, maybe for the hyperbolic space, the metric is something like ds² = dx² + dy² / (1 - (x² + y²)/a²), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the given metric is conformally flat because it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So this is conformally equivalent to the Euclidean metric. But the denominator, 4 - x² - y², suggests that the domain is restricted where 4 - x² - y² > 0, because otherwise the metric would be singular. So x² + y² <4, which is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the surface is defined for points where x² + y² <4.

Now, the area element in such a metric would be the determinant of the metric tensor's components. Since it's in 2D, the metric tensor is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, wait. The area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The metric tensor g is diag[A, A], where A is 32/(4 - x² - y²) for each spatial component. So the determinant of g is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. So sqrt(det g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area would be the integral over the region x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Hmm, but wait, that integral might diverge. Because when you approach the boundary x² + y² =4, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up.

Wait, but maybe I should switch to polar coordinates to evaluate this. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². So the area becomes the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So let's compute this. The integral over θ is 2π. So the area is 2π ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute that integral. Let's make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so (-1/2) du = r dr. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes (32) * ∫ [r dr / (4 - r²)] = 32 * ∫ ( (-1/2) du ) / u. So that's (32 * (-1/2)) ∫ (du/u) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-16) [ln|u| ] from 4 to 0. Wait, but when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) goes to negative infinity. So the integral becomes:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = -16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = -16*(-infty) → which is +infty multiplied by -16, but wait, let's recheck the signs.

Wait, the integral limits are from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2). The substitution gives us:

∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (r dr)/(u) = ∫ (-1/2 du)/u = (-1/2) ∫ (du/u).

So the integral from u=4 to u=0 is (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

That's (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-1/2)( -infty - finite ) → which is positive infinity. Because (-1/2) * (-infty) is +infty.

So the area becomes 2π * 32 * [ integral result ].

Wait, no, the area is 2π * ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Which is 2π * [32 * (1/2) ) * (ln(4 - r²) evaluated from 0 to 2 ) ]? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's re-express the integral ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

Let me compute it directly. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ ( (-1/2) du ) / u = (-1/2) ∫ du/u.

The limits become from u=4 to u=0.

So this is (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0 → (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → ln(0) is negative infinity, so it becomes (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ) → (-1/2)(-infty) is positive infinity. So the integral diverges to positive infinity.

Therefore, the area is 2π * 32 * [ integral ] → which is 2π * 32 * (infinite) → which is infinite.

Wait, but the options don't have an infinite option except for option D, which is +infty.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2.
