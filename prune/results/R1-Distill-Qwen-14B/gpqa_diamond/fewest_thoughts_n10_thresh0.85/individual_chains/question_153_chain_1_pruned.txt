Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, which then leads to the product.

The problem has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part has a different reaction, and we need to determine the major products from the given reactants. Then, match them with the options provided.

Let me go through each part one by one.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the reagent is NaOEt in EtOH. NaOEt is a strong base, so this is likely deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, so it's a strong enough base to form an enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester; its structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but wait, the substituents are at the 3 position. So the structure is CH2-C(O)OCH2-CH2-p-tolyl? Wait, no. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct structure for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate
