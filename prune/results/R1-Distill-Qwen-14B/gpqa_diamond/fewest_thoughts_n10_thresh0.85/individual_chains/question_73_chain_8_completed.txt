Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other is 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as simple as just subtracting the velocities like in classical mechanics, right? Oh right, because when speeds are significant compared to the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So I should apply that here.

Let me plug in the numbers. For the first astronaut, the velocity v1 is 0.6c, and the second astronaut's velocity v2 is 0.5c. So, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Simplifying the numerator: 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c. Looking at the options, let's check which ones have 0.14c for v_rel. Options C and D both have 0.14c.

Next, I need to calculate the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, but wait, no, wait. Actually, in relativity, each object's total energy is given by gamma multiplied by m c squared. So for each astronaut, their energy is gamma * m_i * c², where m_i is their mass and gamma is the Lorentz factor.

The total energy of the system would be the sum of the individual energies. So let me compute each gamma.

For the first astronaut: mass is 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v² is (0.6c)^2 = 0.36 c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Then energy is 1.25 * 2m * c^2 = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. So 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So the energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and option B is 4.96, which doesn't match. Oh wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me recalculate the gamma factors more precisely.

First astronaut: v=0.6c. So (v/c)=0.6. Gamma =1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25. Correct. So 2m * 1.25 c² is 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. (v/c)=0.5. So 1 - 0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660254. So 1/0.8660254 is about 1.1547005. So 3m * 1.1547005 c² is approximately 3.4641015 mc².

Adding 2.5 and 3.4641015 gives 5.9641015... which is approximately 5.96 mc². So the total energy is about 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. So that's the correct choice. 

Wait, but what about the rest mass energy? Because the rest mass of each is already considered in the gamma factor. So adding their energies as I did gives the total relativistic energy. So I think I did that correctly.

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \(2m\), velocity = \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy = \(\gamma \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \(3m\), velocity = \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy = \(\gamma \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2\)

#### Total Energy of the System:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\).

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E = 5.96mc^2\).

These values match **Option C**.
