Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, but wait, actually, parallax is in arcseconds and distance is in parsecs. Like, if something has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. So, the formula is distance d (in parsecs) = 1 / plx (in arcseconds). So, plx is inversely proportional to distance. That means plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. 

So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write this as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5, because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So, N ∝ d^5. Wait, but that can't be right because when parallax increases, the distance decreases. Let me think again.

Wait, the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And since plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx) is d. So, 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5. So, N is proportional to d^5. That would mean that as distance d increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of d. But that seems a bit high. Wait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. But wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It's asking how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, r. Oh, wait, maybe I should think about the number of stars per unit distance, or the density, which is dN/dr. But I'm not sure. Let me parse the question again.

The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm. So per unit distance, so probably the derivative of N with respect to r. Because if N varies with r, then dN/dr would be the change per unit distance.

Given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r (since d is r here, right?), so substituting, N ∝ r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So if N is r^5, then the derivative dN/dr would be 5r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would increase as r^4.

Wait, but wait, am I considering the correct variables here? Let me clarify.

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/d. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which becomes (d)^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is a constant. Then, the number of stars N as a function of distance d is proportional to d^5.

Now, the question is about the change in number of stars with distance. So if we take a small change in d, what is the change in N? That would be the derivative dN/dd. So, dN/dd = 5k d^4. So, the change per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So, as distance increases, the number of stars per unit distance (the density) increases with the fourth power.

Wait, but the options don't have r^4 as an option. Let me
