Okay, so I've just come across this astronomy question, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, like measuring stellar velocities and chemical compositions.

The key information given is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 mag because that's the lower limit for HIRES (since it's brighter than 16 mag). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's worded, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So, it can go up to 17 mag? Or wait, noâ€”apparent magnitude is a measure where lower numbers are brighter. So, if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can detect stars up to 17 mag, right? Because stars brighter than 17 would have lower apparent magnitudes.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Apparent magnitude is such that lower numbers mean brighter. So, if a spectrograph can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, that would mean stars with V mag less than 17. Because 17 is fainter than, say, 15. So, if a star is brighter than 17, it's V mag is less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, the limit is V <=17, and for HIRES, it's V <=16. Because any star brighter than 16 mag (V < 16) can be observed by HIRES. So, for a star to be observable by both, its V mag must be <=16, because that's the brighter condition between the two. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16, so any star fainter than 16 (V mag >16) can't be seen by HIRES, even if ESPRESSO can.

Wait, no. Wait, let me make sure I get
