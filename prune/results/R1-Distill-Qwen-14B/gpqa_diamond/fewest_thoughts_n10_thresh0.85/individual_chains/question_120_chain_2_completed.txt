Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, I think. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So a larger parallax means a closer star.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, their actual number should depend on how volume changes with distance. Because when you look farther away, the volume increases, but stars are spread out, so maybe the density changes?

Wait, uniform distribution probably means that the number density of stars is constant in space. So if you have a certain volume, the number of stars is proportional to that volume. So if I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a spherical shell is surface area times thickness, and surface area is 4πr².

But since the parallax plx is 1/d, I can express d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. Then, dr (the change in distance) would be related to the change in plx. Let me think about differentials. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So taking the derivative of both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, so dr = -(1/(plx²)) dplx. Wait, but I'm considering a range in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx. So for small dplx, the corresponding dr is negative, meaning as plx increases, d decreases.

But for the number of stars in a shell, the volume is 4πd² dr. Let me express that in terms of plx. Since dr = - (1/plx²) dplx, but for a small change, I can take the absolute value. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because d is 1/plx, so d squared is (1/plx)^2. And dr is (1/plx²) dplx. So putting it all together:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. If d = 1/plx, then dr = ( -1/plx² ) dplx. But since I'm considering a thin shell, the volume is 4π d² * |dr|. So |dr| is (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. Wait, that can't be right because that would be 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. That seems high.

Wait, maybe I messed up the substitution. Let's see: Volume = 4π d² dr. But dr = (1/(plx²)) dplx because d = 1/plx, so dd = -dplx / plx². Oh wait, no—because d =1/plx, so dr = dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by that amount. So the change in distance is dr = - (dplx) / (plx^2). So the absolute value is |dr|= dplx / plx².

So plugging into Volume: 4π d² * (dplx / plx²) ). But d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx². So substituting:

4π * (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

Wait, no wait, that's d squared times dr. So 4π * (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

Hmm, but that would mean the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 1/plx^4, because the number density is uniform. So if the number density is n (number per volume), then the number of stars is n * Volume = n * (4π d² dr) = n * (4π (1/plx^2) (dplx / plx^2)) ), which is n * 4π (dplx / plx^4).

Wait, so the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4? But the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So that would be the number of stars in a range dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx is ~1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, the number of stars per unit volume is considered. Wait, but in this case, the distribution is uniform, so the number density is constant.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume. So for a given parallax range, we need to find how the number of stars (per unit plx) varies. Since plx is 1/d, the volume between d and d+dd is 4πd² dd. But plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Then dd = -d (d plx)/d plx. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, express the volume in terms of plx.

Volume = 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx². And dd = (dd plx) * (dd plx / dd d) ). Hmm, maybe better to write in terms of plx.

Let me take d = 1/plx. Then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, Volume = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx^2) ( -1/plx² dplx ) ) → but taking absolute value, it's 4π (1/plx^2) (dplx / plx² ) ) = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

So the number of stars in a small dplx range is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but another thought: if the number density is constant, then the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume of that shell. So as parallax increases (i.e., distance decreases), the shell's volume decreases, so fewer stars? Or wait, no, because plx is inversely proportional to distance. So when plx increases, you're looking at closer stars. So the volume of the shell at a given plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 times the thickness in distance, which is (1/plx^2) dplx. So putting it together, the Volume is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So yes, number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the volume is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( d\text{plx} \): \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Taking the absolute value, \( |dd| = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \).

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( |dd| = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the volume formula, the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in the shell is proportional to its volume. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

From the given options:

- **A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \):** Matches the derived proportionality.
- **B) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \):** Incorrect, as it does not account for the \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \) dependence.
- **C) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \):** Incorrect, as it underestimates the dependence on \( \text{plx} \).
- **D) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \):** Incorrect, as it does not match the derived proportionality.

The correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
