Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this is a classic acid-base titration problem.

The problem says we start by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution factor. So the initial volume is 20 cm³, diluted by adding another 20 cm³ of water. That makes the total volume 40 cm³. 

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M2 (the diluted concentration) would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. Actually, when you dilute a solution by adding equal volumes, the concentration is halved. Because 20 mL + 20 mL makes 40 mL, which is double the original volume. So yeah, 0.05 / 2 is 0.025 M. That makes sense.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Now, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The next part is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me think about what happens during titration. For a weak acid and strong base, the equivalence point is where moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid present. So I'll need to calculate that first.

The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. Because 40 cm³ is 0.04 liters, right.

Now, when titrated with NaOH, each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid. So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be 0.001 moles. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration. So volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about pH at 25% titration and equivalence point. So for 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, let's make sure. 25% titration means 25% of the acid has been neutralized. Since the
