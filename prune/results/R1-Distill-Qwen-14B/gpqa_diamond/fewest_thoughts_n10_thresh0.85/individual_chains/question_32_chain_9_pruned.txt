Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. And I need to find the energy of the RHIC in GeV. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass number is 6. So it's Li-6, I think. So the atomic mass would be roughly the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

First, I need to find the relativistic energy of the nucleus. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. So gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So v is 0.96c. Let me calculate gamma. Let me plug that in.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) → simplifies to 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2). Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is... 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 → approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/0.28 is 100/28, which is about 3.57142857... So gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, more accurately, let me calculate sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute 0.28 squared: 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So yeah, gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c² or something like that. Let me get precise numbers.

Wait, I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Each u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 * 931.5 MeV is 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. But wait, that's the rest energy of the nucleus. Since the nucleus is moving, we'll multiply by gamma.

So E = gamma * m c^2. So E is gamma times the rest energy. So, 3.5714 multiplied by 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Hmm, let's do this step by step. 3 * 5.589 is 16.767. 0.5714 * 5.589 is... let me compute that.

0.5 times 5.589 is 2.7945. 0.0714 times 5.589 is approx 0.0714 *5.589. Let's see:

5.589 * 0.07 = 0.39123, and 5.589 *0.0014= approx 0.0078246. So total is about 0.3990546. So 0.5714 *5.589 is about 2.7945 + 0.3990546 = 3.19355.

So total E is 16.767 + 3.19355 = 19.96055 GeV. Approximately 19.96 GeV.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is actually about 6.017 u. Because the exact mass can be found from the periodic table. Let me check: the atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.017 u.

So 6.017 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.017 * 931.5 ≈ Let's compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.017 *931.5 is about 15.8355. So total is 5589 +15.8355 = 5604.8355 MeV, which is 5.6048355 GeV.

So m c^2 is about 5.6048 GeV.

So gamma is 3.5714. So E = 3.5714 * 5.6048 GeV.

Compute 3.5714 *5.6048.

Let me compute 3 *5.6048=16.8144.

0.5714 *5.6048.

Compute 0.5 *5.6048=2.8024.

0.0714 *5.6048 ≈ Let's approximate.

5.6048 *0.07 is 0.392336, and 5.6048 *0.0014= ~0.00784672. So 0.392336 +0.00784672≈0.400183. So 0.0714 *5.6048 ≈0.400183.

So 0.5714 *5.6048 is 2.8024 + 0.400183 = 3.202583.

So total E is 16.8144 +3.202583 =19.016983 GeV.

Wait, that's about 19.017 GeV. But wait, I thought earlier it came to around 19.96 GeV, but that was when the mass was 5.589 GeV. Now with 5.6048 GeV, it's a bit higher, around 19 GeV. Hmmm.

Wait, no. Wait, 3.5714 *5.6048 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.6048:

Let me break it down:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857

3.5714 * 0.6048 = ?

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 * 0.0048 = 0.01714272

So 2.14284 + 0.01714272 = 2.15998272.

So total is 17.857 +2.15998272 =19.01698 GeV.

So approximately 19.017 GeV.

But wait, the options don't have 19 GeV. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, none of them is 19 GeV. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass. Let me think again. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.017 atomic mass units (u). But wait, each u is 1.0
