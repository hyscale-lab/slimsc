Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentrations are given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are provided as 9, 40, 63, and 16.

Wait, stability constants... I remember that they indicate the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, β1 is the constant for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-?), and so on. But I'm not entirely sure about the charge here, but maybe that's not crucial for percentages.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached, I think. So that would be the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{n}, and the stability constant β2 is 40. Wait, but the options have numbers that don't necessarily correspond directly to β2, so I need to think about all possible complexes and their contributions.

I think the approach is to consider all possible complexes that cobalt can form with thiocyanate and then find the fraction of each. The total concentration of all cobalt species (free Co^2+ and all complexes) should sum up to the initial cobalt concentration. But since the solution is 0.01 M Co^2+ and 0.1 M SCN^-, the complexes will form based on these concentrations and the stability constants.

So, the first step is to model the formation of each complex. Let's denote the species:

1. Free Co^2+: [Co^2+]
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ : let's call its concentration [C1]
3. [Co(SCN)_2]: [C2]
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^2- : [C3]
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^3- : [C4]

The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, stability constants are for each step. For example, β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-. So, β1 = [C1]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]).

But wait, the formation steps:

- Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ → β1 = 9
- [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN)_2] → β2 = 40
- [CoSCN)_2] + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN)_3] → β3 = 63
- [CoSCN)_3] + SCN^- ↔
