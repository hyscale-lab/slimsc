Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, but wait, actually, parallax is measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, so it's plx (in arcsec) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, distance r is inversely proportional to plx. So r = 1/plx.

Now, the problem is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So I think I need to find N as a function of r.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/r, since plx = 1/r. So substituting, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Because if plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So substituting plx = 1/r into 1/plx^5 would be 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that.

1/(1/r)^5 equals r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but wait, N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, so 1/plx^5 is (r)^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance r. Wait, no, the question is asking how the number of stars in that region per unit range of distance changes with r. Hmm, I might be getting confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, for a given change in parallax, how does N change. But since parallax is inversely related to distance, I need to express N in terms of r.

Wait, another approach: Let's express N as a function of r. Since plx = 1/r, then 1/plx = r. So N ∝ (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But the question is about the number of stars in a region per unit range of distance. So perhaps they're asking about the differential number of stars, like dN/dr.

Wait, but wait. The way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So it's the rate of change of N with respect to r, or maybe the number of stars per unit distance. Maybe I should think in terms of differential number.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr. Because when you're considering a range of distance, like a shell, the number of stars in that shell depends on how the density changes with r.

Wait, but the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So maybe the number of stars within a certain distance is proportional to 1/plx^5. Wait, perhaps N is the number of stars per unit volume or per unit distance? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this. Let me model the number of stars as a function of parallax. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance r (plx = 1/r), so substituting, N = k * (r)^5, where k is some constant. So as r increases, N increases as r
