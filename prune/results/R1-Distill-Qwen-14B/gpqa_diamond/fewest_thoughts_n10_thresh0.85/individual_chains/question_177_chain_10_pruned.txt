Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and think through what I know.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities: Star_1 is stationary (0 km/s) and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies, and we need to find by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since they're black bodies, that should apply here. So the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, the problem mentions the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right! That's the peak wavelength of their black body radiation, given by Wien's law. Wien's displacement law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if the λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, that's interesting. So both stars have the same temperature. Then, the luminosity should depend on their radius squared times T^4. But since T is same, L is proportional to R².

Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1 = (R1² / R2²) * L2. Because T is the same, so T1^4 = T2^4.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, no, because L1 = 4πR1²σT1⁴ and L2 = 4πR2²
