Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use special relativity formulas, not the classical ones. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states that the masses are 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so both are moving in the same direction. That's important because relative velocity would depend on their speeds as per relativity.

First, I need to find the relative speed between them. Oh right, when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds. In special relativity, you can't just subtract the velocities. The formula for relative velocity is a bit different. Let me recall it.

I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)), but wait, I'm not sure. Oh wait, actually, if two objects are moving at u and v relative to a stationary observer, then the speed of one as seen from the other is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. From A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait no, actually, the question is asking for the relative speed. But relative speed could be either the speed of one from the other's frame, but which one's perspective? The problem isn't specific, so maybe it's the speed of the slower one as seen from the faster one's frame? Or perhaps the speed of the faster from the slower's frame. Hmm, but the problem says "relative speed", which is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's the speed of one from the other's frame.

Wait, the first part is the relative speed, which would be the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's perspective. Let's say we take astronaut A (2m) moving at 0.6c, and B (3m) at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

Wait, no. If both are moving in the same direction, the one behind (maybe B, since 0.5c is slower) would be moving at a lower speed. So from A's frame, B is actually moving backward? No, no, wait. No, because both are moving in the same direction, but A is faster. So from A's frame, B is moving slower, but what's the exact speed?

Wait, let's think in terms of relative velocity. If the speed of B as seen from the rest frame is u = 0.5c, and the speed of A is v = 0.6c, then the relative speed of B with respect to A would be (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, but if u is
