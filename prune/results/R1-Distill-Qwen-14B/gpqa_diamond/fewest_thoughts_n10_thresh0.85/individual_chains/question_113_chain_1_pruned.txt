Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me start by going through the given data step by step. The problem mentions several characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I'll take each part one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually correspond to O-H stretching. So, that suggests the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad peak, maybe even a bit lower? Or is it more about the width? Hmm. Also, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which could indicate a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps a conjugated one, or maybe an aromatic ring with some conjugation.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has at least one double bond. That makes me think of something like an ester, maybe, because esters have both carbonyl groups and sometimes double bonds if the ester comes from a vinyl group.

Then the Mass Spec part: there's a fragment peak at m/z=45. I'm trying to think what has a mass of 45. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (which is 43, but maybe with some addition?), or maybe something like (CH2)2O. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since CH3 is 15, so two CH3 would be 30 plus O is 16, total 46? Wait, no. 15 (CH3) *2 = 30, plus 16=46. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps a COCH3 group? Wait, CO is 28, CH3 is 15, so that's 43. No. Maybe another approach. The m/z of 45 could be the tropylium ion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene or another fragment. Alternatively, the base peak at 45 could be the molecular ion minus something. Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me think about the possible formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So all of these have 6 carbons. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each to see what structures are possible.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For A) C6H12O2: C=6, H=12.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring and/or a double bond.

B) C6H10O: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. So two DoU. Could be two rings, a ring and
