Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The question says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has molecules where the number of neutrons and protons is the same. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. There's also something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

The options are about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. I'm to sum the lightest and heaviest, considering all their isotopes present.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to identify what X, Y, W, G, and B are.

Substance X reacts with Y violently. That makes me think of a reaction that's exothermic and possibly involves something like a metal reacting with an acid. For example, metals reacting with acids (like HCl or H2SO4) to produce hydrogen gas. But wait, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases.

The gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's see, for a molecule, the number of protons and neutrons per atom... Or maybe per molecule? Wait, the question says "the same number of neutrons and protons"—I think per molecule. So for example, H2 (but H has 1 proton and 1 neutron in some isotopes). Or maybe something else.

Wait, maybe the gas is CO2? No, that's a linear molecule but for each molecule, the number of protons (from C and O) and neutrons would vary. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's hydrogen gas. Each H2 molecule has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium, but H can be H or D). So each H2 molecule would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So protons = 2, neutrons = 2. They are equal. So that fits. So W could be H2.

If that's the case, then Y is probably an acid, like HCl or H2SO4. But wait, when metals react with acids, they produce H2 gas. So maybe X is a metal, Y is an acid.

But then, the precipitate G forms. If X is a metal reacting with an acid, the precipitate might be the metal hydroxide if the reaction isn't with a strong acid. Or maybe another product. Alternatively, if Y is a base, but that might not fit. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: X could be a carbonate. Maybe Y is an acid like HCl. When carbonate reacts with HCl, it produces CO2 gas (so W is CO2?), but wait, CO2's molecule has 12 protons (C:6, O:6 each, so 6 +6*2=18? Wait no, wait. Wait, each CO2 molecule: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's carbon-12), and each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (oxygen-16). So each CO2 molecule has 6+8*2=22 protons and (6 + 16*2)=38 neutrons. Wait, that's not equal. So protons (22) vs neutrons (38) — not equal. So that can't be the gas.

Hmm, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think of other possibilities. What about NH3 gas? No, that's a liquid under standard conditions. Or maybe H2O vapor? No, because H2O isn’t a product of a violent reaction between a metal and an acid.

Wait, maybe the gas is CH4? Let's see: each CH4 has 6 protons (C:6, H:4×1=4; total 10 protons) and for neutrons: C has 6, H has 0, so total 6 neutrons. Protons (10) vs neutrons (6) — not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait another approach: the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's compute for small molecules.

For example, if the molecule is H2O. Each molecule has 2 H's (1 proton each) and 1 O (8 protons). So total protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: each H has 0 (if protium), O has 8. So each H2O molecule has 8 neutrons. 10 protons vs 8 neutrons — not equal.

What about O2? Each O2 molecule: each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So each O2 has 16 protons (8×2) and 16 neutrons (8×2). So same. So W could be O2.

But, when would a reaction produce O2? Maybe a decomposition reaction. But the reaction between X and Y is violent. Alternatively, maybe a reaction involving a peroxide. Hmm, not sure.

Wait another thought: What about N2? Each molecule has 14 protons (7×2), and 14 neutrons (7×2 each). So same. So W could be N2.

But what reaction would produce N2 gas in such a scenario?

Alternatively, maybe W is a noble gas. For example, He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (in He-4), so He's a monoatomic gas. So each molecule is He, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So same.

But then, what reaction would produce He? Unlikely in this context.

Wait, maybe W is H2. Because each H2 molecule would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if deuterium, but not necessary; protium has 1 neutron, so H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons). So that's 2 each. So W could be H2.

If that's the case, then the reaction is between a metal (X) and an acid (Y) to produce H2 gas.

So, X is a metal that reacts with an acid Y (like HCl or H2SO4) to produce H2 gas, as well as a precipitate G.

Wait, but when a metal reacts with an acid, the precipitate would be the metal's salt. Unless it's a carbonate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more like a double displacement, producing a precipitate.

Wait, another possibility: X is an alkali metal, like sodium. Reacting with water (Y is H2O?), but that would produce H2 gas and sodium hydroxide. But then, no precipitate would form unless sodium hydroxide is in excess. But if Y is another acid, say HCl, then sodium would react to produce NaCl, H2
