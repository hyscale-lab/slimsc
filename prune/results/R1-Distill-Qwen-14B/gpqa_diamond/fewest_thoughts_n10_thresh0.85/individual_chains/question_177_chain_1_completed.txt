Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

So the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The setup is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and it's also 1.5 times more massive. But wait, the problem is about luminosity, so I think mass might not directly affect it here. Oh, but wait, luminosity depends on radius and temperature, right?

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, the wavelength of maximum brightness is related to the star's temperature. I remember something about Wien's Law. Oh right, Wien's displacement law states that λ_max * T = constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the stars' velocities are given, could that affect anything? The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh, right, radial velocity is about Doppler shift. So if a star is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, and moving away would be redshifted. But wait, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, does that affect the measured wavelength? Because when we observe the star's spectrum, the Doppler effect would shift the wavelengths. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, making λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 - v/c), or something like that. But wait, wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps we have to correct for the Doppler shift when calculating their actual temperatures.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. Hmm. So perhaps we need to consider whether the observed λ_max is the same, but their actual emitted λ_max could be different due to Doppler shifts.

Let me think. So, for Star_2, if it's moving at 700 km/s, what's the Doppler shift? Let me calculate that. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign. If the star is moving towards us, v is positive, and the observed wavelength is shorter than emitted. So to get the emitted wavelength, I need to correct for the Doppler shift.

Wait, the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ1 = λ1_emitted.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. I need to find whether it's moving towards or away from us. Oh, wait, radial velocity is given as 700 km/s, but the direction isn't specified. Hmm, but for Doppler shift, the sign matters. Let's assume it's moving towards us, which would cause a blueshift, so the observed λ would be smaller. Wait, but in the problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its λ_observed would be shorter than its emitted λ. But since both observed λs are same, that would mean that Star_2's emitted λ is longer than Star_1's. Because if Star_2 is blueshifted, its observed λ is smaller, but wait, the problem says both observed λs are same. So Star_2's emitted λ must be longer, so that when it's blueshifted, the observed λ is same as Star_1, which isn't shifted.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. 

If Star_1 has v_r=0, its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted λ_max. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s, so if it's moving towards us, its observed λ_max would be lower (blueshifted). But the problem says the observed λ_max for both is same. So Star_2's observed λ must be same as Star_1's. Therefore, Star_2's emitted λ must be longer, because it's blueshifted.

So, let's denote λ1 as the emitted λ for Star_1. λ2_emitted would be the actual wavelength it emits. But because Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed λ2_observed = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ) since it's approaching. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the Doppler formula. Let me write it down correctly. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_observed / λ_emitted = sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ) ), where β = v/c.

But wait, if the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter, so the ratio λ_obs/λ_emit is less than 1, meaning the denominator is larger than numerator. So, for Star_2, since it's moving towards us (assuming v_r is positive when moving away?), wait no, wait. Radial velocity: positive v_r implies moving away, negative implies moving towards. Or the other way around?

Wait, the radial velocity is usually given as v_r, which is the component along the line of sight. So if v_r is positive, the star is moving away, causing a redshift. If it's negative, moving towards us, causing blueshift.

In this problem, Star_1 has v_r=0, so no shift. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's moving towards or away. Hmm. So perhaps it's moving away, positive velocity. That would mean its observed wavelength is longer (redshifted).

Wait, but the problem says both stars have same observed λ_max. So Star_1's λ_emit = λ_obs.

Star_2's λ_obs is the same as Star_1's. But if Star_2 is moving away, its λ_obs is longer than its emitted λ_emit. So for Star_2, λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) )? Wait, no, wait. The Doppler formula for a receding source (v positive) is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, let me get that right. The Doppler shift for a source moving away (v positive) is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

But wait, I might have it reversed. I think the formula is λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but only when the source is moving away. So if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer.

So, in our problem, Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s, which we'll take as moving away. So its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted. But according to the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is same. So:

λ1_emit = λ_obs (since Star_1's v_r is 0).

λ2_emit * Doppler_factor = λ_obs.

Because Star_2's observed λ is same as Star_1's. So:

λ2_emit = λ_obs / Doppler_factor.

But the Doppler factor for Star_2 is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but since v is 700 km/s, which is much smaller than the speed of light (c ≈ 3e5 km/s), we can approximate this.

Wait, 700 km/s is 700e3 m/s. c is 3e5 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. So 700 km/s is about 0.00233c. So the approximation can be made using the non-relativistic Doppler shift, which is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c). But wait, when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength increases by (1 + v/c). So the non-relativistic formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c).

So for Star_2, since it's moving away, v_r = 700 km/s. So:

λ_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c)

But we know λ_obs is equal for both stars. So:

λ1_emit = λ_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c)

Thus:

λ2_emit = λ1_emit / (1 + v_r/c)

But since v_r is much less than c, v_r/c is approximately 700e3 / 3e5e3 = 700/(3e5) = approx 0.002333.

So (1 + v_r/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So, λ2_emit ≈ λ1_emit / 1.002333 ≈ λ1_emit * (1 - 0.002333) ≈ 0.997667 * λ1_emit.

Wait, but this is a very small difference. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 700 km/s as a fraction of c.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.00233333.

So 1 + v/c = 1.00233333.

Now, let's compute 1/(1.00233333) ≈ 0.997667.

So, λ2_emit ≈ λ1_emit * 0.997667.

But wait, if the stars' emission peaks at the same observed wavelength, this tells us that their emitted wavelengths are different. So for Star_1, λ1_emit = λ_obs. For Star_2, λ2_emit is less than λ_obs, because it's moving away, causing redshift. Wait, no. Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted light is longer in wavelength than what is observed. Wait, no. Let me think: when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). So, if λ_obs is same for both, then λ_emit for Star_2 must be less than that of Star_1. Because λ_obs = λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c). So λ2_emit = λ1_emit/(1 + v/c) ≈ 0.997667 * λ1_emit.

So, Star_2 emits at a slightly shorter wavelength than Star_1. So, their temperatures would be different because of Wien's law. Because λ_max * T = constant.

Wien's displacement law: λ_max (emitted) = B / T, where B is Wien's constant (~2.8977719e-3 m·K).

So, for each star:

λ1_emit = B / T1

λ2_emit = B / T2

So, T1 = B / λ1_emit

T2 = B / λ2_emit

So, T2 = (λ1_emit / λ2_emit) * T1

But λ2_emit = λ1_emit / (1 + v/c), so:

T2 = (1 + v/c) * T1

So, T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Because (1 + 0.002333) = 1.002333.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So, the temperature of Star_2 is a bit higher than Star_1.

So, now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4πR² σ T⁴

Where R is radius, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, for Star_1, L1 = 4π (R1)² σ T1⁴

For Star_2, L2 = 4π (R2)² σ T2⁴

The problem states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2: R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, R1 = 1.5 R2 => R2 = (2/3) R1.

But wait, the problem says radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, substituting R1 and R2:

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T1^4 = 4π (2.25 R2²) σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ (T2)^4

So, the ratio L1/L2 is:

[ (2.25 R2²) T1^4 ] / [ R2² T2^4 ] )

Simplify R2² cancels out. So:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1 / T2)^4

We found earlier that T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) = T1 * 1.002333.

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997667.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.997667)^4

Hmm, let's compute (0.997667)^4.

First, compute 0.997667 ≈ 1 - 0.002333.

We can approximate (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - n x, for small x.

So, (0.997667)^4 ≈ (1 - 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 - 4 * 0.002333 = 1 - 0.009333 ≈ 0.990667.

But more accurately, let's compute (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute step by step.

Compute 0.997667^2:

0.997667 * 0.997667 ≈ (approx.)

= (1 - 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004666 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995339.

Then, square that to get to the 4th power.

0.995339^2 ≈ (approx.)

= (1 - 0.004661)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004661 + (0.004661)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009322 + 0.0000217 ≈ 0.990699.

So, about 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total approx 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

Wait, but wait, the options are around 2.23, 2.25, etc. So this would point towards option D) ~2.23.

But wait, let me check the calculation again because I might be making a mistake.

Wait, let's compute (0.997667)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute 0.997667^1 = 0.997667

0.997667^2 = let's compute 0.997667 * 0.997667.

Let me compute 997667 * 997667, but that's tedious. Alternatively, use calculator method:

First, 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667.

Squaring that:

(0.997667)^2 = (1 - 0.002333)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 = 1 - 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 0.99533944.

Then, square again:

(0.99533944)^2.

Compute 0.99533944 * 0.99533944.

Approximate this as (1 - 0.00466056)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00466056 + (0.00466056)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00932112 + 0.00002172 ≈ 0.9906996.

So, (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9906996.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9906996 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but let me think again. Because if I didn't make a mistake in the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the direction of Star_2's velocity. If Star_2 is moving towards us, then the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

In that case, since λ_obs is same as Star_1's, which is λ1_emit, we'd have:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, λ2_emit = λ1_emit / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

= λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which would then imply that T2 = B / λ2_emit = B / ( λ1_emit * sqrt( (1+v/c)/(1 -v/c) ) ) )

= [ B / λ1_emit ] * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But that would make T2 less than T1. Which would change the calculation.

Wait, but the problem says radial velocity is 700 km/s for Star_2. What's the sign convention? Radial velocity is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards. So in the problem, Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s, which is moving away, so observed wavelength is longer. So in that case, earlier calculation is correct.

But to be thorough, perhaps I should compute it using the exact Doppler formula.

Using the exact formula:

For Star_2, since it's moving away, the Doppler factor is:

λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, more accurately, the Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

So, λ_obs = λ_emit * ( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )^(1/2)

So, for Star_2, we have:

λ_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ_obs is same as Star_1's, which is λ1_emit.

So,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

λ2_emit = λ1_emit / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, λ2_emit = λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Now, using v/c = 700e3 / 3e5e3 = 700/(3e5) = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.0023333.

So,

(1 - v/c) ≈ 0.9976667

(1 + v/c) ≈ 1.0023333

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) ≈ 0.995334.

So the square root of that is sqrt(0.995334) ≈ 0.997664.

So,

λ2_emit ≈ λ1_emit * 0.997664.

So, T2 = B / λ2_emit = (B / λ1_emit ) * (1 / 0.997664 )

Which is T1 * (1 / 0.997664 )

Compute 1/0.997664 ≈ 1.00234.

So, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00234.

So, T2 is about 0.234% higher than T1.

Now, compute L1/L2.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R2 = R1 / 1.5.

So,

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T1^4 = 4π (2.25 R2²) σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ (T2)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25 R2² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) ) = 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4.

Since T2 = T1 * 1.00234,

T1/T2 = 1/1.00234 ≈ 0.997664.

So,

(0.997664)^4 ≈ ?

Compute 0.997664^2 = approx 0.995333.

Then square that: 0.995333^2 ≈ 0.990699.

So,

(0.997664)^4 ≈ 0.990699.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990699 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, so option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical laws.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \) (not directly relevant to luminosity)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_{r1} = 0 \, \text{km/s}, v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)

2. **Observed Wavelengths**:
   - Both stars have the same observed wavelength of maximum brightness (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)).

3. **Doppler Shift**:
   - Star_2 is moving away from the observer (\( v_r > 0 \)), causing its emitted wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \)) to be blueshifted relative to its observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)).
   - Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
     \]
     For small \( v/c \), this can be approximated as:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emit}} (1 + v/c)
     \]
     Solving for \( \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \):
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + v/c}
     \]
     Substituting \( v/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \):
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{obs}} \cdot (1 - 0.002333) \approx 0.997667 \cdot \lambda_{\text{obs}}
     \]

4. **Wien's Law**:
   - The wavelength of maximum brightness is inversely proportional to temperature:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto \frac{1}{T}
     \]
     For Star_1 (\( \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) and Star_2 (\( \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \approx 0.997667 \cdot \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)):
     \[
     T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c) \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
     \]

5. **Luminosity**:
   - Luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
     The ratio of luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
     Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333 \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1.002333)^4} = 2.25 \cdot (0.997667)^4
     \]
     Approximating \( (0.997667)^4 \approx 0.9907 \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229
     \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2.

**Answer: D**
