Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed for the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is currently in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state.

First, I need to figure out which energy transitions are involved. The model here is the rotation-vibration model, which I think accounts for both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But wait, the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor is a bit different because it allows the bond length to change, but in this case, maybe the bond length is given, so perhaps it's treated as a rigid rotor for this purpose.

Wait, but the problem also gives an angular frequency for vibration, which is w = 4e14 rad/s. So maybe this is about the vibration part. Or maybe the rotation part? Hmm. Let me think.

The molecule can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so it's considering both types of motion. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So, the next state could be a higher energy state either in rotation, vibration, or a combination.

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. So, the photon's energy should match the energy difference between the two states. The question is about the momentum of the photon.

I remember that the energy of a photon is E = h*f, but since we're dealing with angular frequency, E can also be written as E = ħ*w, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. The energy for rotational states is given by E_rot = B * J*(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For the rigid rotor, the rotational constant B is h^2/(8π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia. But wait, maybe I should think about the moment of inertia first.

The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. The reduced mass μ is (m_x * m_y)/(m_x + m_y). Let me compute that. Given Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh wait, amu is atomic mass units. I need to convert that into kilograms because the standard units are in SI.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's calculate: 1.818 * 1.6605 is roughly 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1.818 * 1.6605e-27:

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's see: 1.8 * 1.66 is 2.988, and 0.018 *1.6605 is about 0.02989. So total is ~3.0178e-27 kg.

But wait, maybe more precise calculation isn't necessary yet. Let's proceed.

The rotational constant B is given by B = ħ² / (2 I). Alternatively, B = (h²)/(8π² I). Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number.

But the question is about the transition to the next state. So, if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. For a diatomic, the fundamental state would have J=0 (for rotation) and n=0 (for vibration). But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest, so the next state would be either a rotational state (J increases) or a vibrational state (n increases). Which transition would require less energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels have a much larger spacing than rotational ones, typically. So if the photon is absorbed, the molecule could transition either to the next vibrational level (n=1) or the next rotational level (J=1). But which transition is happening here?

The problem says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the energy difference between the next possible state and the current state. So we need to find which transition (vibrational or rotational) has the lower energy difference.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So the energy for J=0 is 0, J=1 is 2B, J=2 is 6B, etc. The difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B.

For the vibrational energy levels, the energy is given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. The zero-point energy is (1/2) h w. The next state is n=1, so the energy difference is h w. So the energy difference when transitioning from n=0 to n=1 is h w.

So we need to compare the energy differences of the two possible transitions: rotational (from J=0 to J=1) requires 2B, and vibrational (n=0 to n=1) requires h w. Whichever is smaller would be the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh wait, perhaps the molecule can transition to the next state which could be either rotational or vibrational. So if the vibrational transition requires less energy, then the photon's energy is ħ w. But if the rotational transition requires less, then it uses the rotational energy.

So let me compute both and compare.

First, compute B.

B is h²/(8 π² I c), but wait, no, I think the formula is B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), but I might be mixing this with the bond dissociation energy. Alternatively, B is often expressed as h c / (4 π² c I), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant with units of cm^-1. The rotational constant B is given by B = h/(8 π² c I), where I is the moment of inertia in g cm².

Wait, because the units for B are cm^-1, which is energy when multiplied by hc. Alternatively, since B is often expressed in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of energy. Alternatively, the energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I), because E_rot = (J (J+1)) * ħ² / (2 I).

Wait, let me get this straight. The rotational energy is given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia in kg·m².

So for J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, E_rot is (ħ² * 2)/(2 I) = ħ²/(I).

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is ħ²/(I).

Similarly, the vibrational energy difference is h w. Wait, no, the energy difference is between n=0 and n=1. So the vibrational energy difference is ( (1 + 1/2) h w ) - (1/2 h w ) ) = h w. So the photon's energy must be h w.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule can transition either to the next rotational state (J=1) or the next vibrational state (n=1). So the lower of the two energy differences will determine which transition occurs.

So let me compute both energy differences and compare them.

First, compute the energy for the rotational transition (J=0 to J=1):

ΔE_rot = (ħ² * 2)/(2 I) = ħ²/(I) = ( (h/(2π))² ) / I.

But wait, ħ is h/(2π), so ħ² is h²/(4 π²). Therefore, ΔE_rot = [h²/(4 π²)] / I.

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r². So I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass, which we calculated as approximately 3.018e-27 kg. r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating I: (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg·m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot = (h²)/(4 π² I).

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

So h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

4 π² is about 39.478.

So denominator is 4 π² * I = 39.478 * 1.2072e-46 ≈ 4.76e-45.

So ΔE_rot ≈ (4.39e-67) / (4.76e-45) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Now compute the vibrational energy difference, ΔE_vib = h w.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.6504e-19 J.

Wait, but 9.22e-23 J is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon would cause a rotational transition, not a vibrational one, because it's the lower energy difference.

Wait, but wait. That can't be right. Because the vibrational energy is higher than rotational, but wait, we're calculating which transition is lower in energy. The rotational transition requires about 9e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational 2.65e-19 J. So the photon would cause the molecule to transition to the next rotational state, not the vibrational.

But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. So in this case, the rotational transition requires less energy, so that's the transition.

So the photon's energy must match ΔE_rot, which is about 9.22e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. So I need to find p, the momentum of the photon.

I remember that for a photon, E = p c. So p = E / c.

Wait, but wait. The energy of the photon is E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.22e-23 J.

So p_photon = E_photon / c.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p_photon = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Calculating that: 9.22e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, but none of the options are close to that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I messed up the calculation for the moment of inertia or the rotational energy.

Let me re-calculate I. μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. So 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = ?

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.018, so 3.018e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg·m².

Right, that's correct.

Then, ΔE_rot = (h²)/(4 π² I).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approximately (6.626)^2 = 43.9 → 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67 J²·s².

So 4 π² I = 4 * (pi^2) * 1.2072e-46. Pi^2 is about 9.8696, so 4 *9.8696 = ~39.4784. Multiply by 1.2072e-46: 39.4784 *1.2072e-46 ≈ (39.4784 *1.2072) = approx 47.64, so 47.64e-46 =4.764e-45.

So ΔE_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.764e-45 = approximately (4.39 / 4.764) * 1e-22 → ~0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J. So that's correct.

Then, p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, none of these are 3e-31. So I must have made a mistake in the approach. Maybe I got the model wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the rotational energy but the vibrational. Because the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range, which is larger than what I calculated for rotational transition.

Wait, perhaps the transition is vibrational, not rotational. Let's re-calculate the vibrational energy.

ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 s^-1 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Then, p_photon = E_photon / c = 2.6504e-19 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 8.835e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is about 8.8e-28 kg·m/s, which is 8.8e-28 Ns (since 1 Ns = 1 kg·m/s).

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. 8.8e-28 isn't an option. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the model. Because the question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the transition isn't purely rotational or vibrational, but a combination.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state would be the next possible state, which could be either a rotational state (J=1) or a vibrational state (n=1). Since the vibrational transition requires more energy than rotational, the molecule is more likely to transition to the rotational state. But according to my earlier calculation, the rotational transition's photon momentum is 3e-31, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the rovibrational transition, where the molecule transitions both in rotation and vibration. But that usually requires more energy. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking about the transition from the ground vibrational state but the ground rotational state (J=0, n=0) to the next state, which could be either J=1 or n=1. But perhaps the next state in terms of overall energy is the rotational one, as it requires less energy.

Wait, but the problem is that the options don't match either of the two possibilities I considered. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy differently. Let me think again about the formula.

The rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I), correct.

But let me compute ħ: ħ = h/(2 pi) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So for J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_rot = [ (ħ² * 2) ]/(2 I) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, yes, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate I in kg·m² correctly.

Wait, r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So r squared is 4e-20 m².

μ is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = μ * r² = 3.018e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2072e-46 kg·m².

Then, ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.2072) * 1e-22 → ~0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J, same as before.

So the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J, which gives a momentum of E/c = 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way larger than that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: maybe the molecule's moment of inertia is being treated as I = m r², using the reduced mass. Or perhaps I should calculate the rotational constant in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, the rotational energy can also be expressed in terms of the rotational frequency. The rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I via B = ħ²/(2 I c), but that might be for the wavenumbers.

Wait, alternatively, the rotational energy levels can be expressed using the formula involving the angular velocity. The energy is E_rot = (I ω²) (J (J+1))/2, where ω is the angular velocity. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the rotational energy can be written as E_rot = (J (J+1)) * ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency. So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is ħ ω_rot.

Hmm, but I don't have ω_rot given. The question gives w as the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, not the rotational. Because the rotational transition would require a photon with much lower energy than the given options.

Wait, let me compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition. E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, p_photon = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = ~8.83e-28 kg·m/s, which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 isn't present. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reduced mass for the vibration as well. Because the vibrational energy depends on the reduced mass.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w. So that part seems correct.

But perhaps the angular frequency w is given as the vibration frequency, so the energy difference is correct.

So why are the options so much higher than the calculated 8.8e-28 Ns (for the vibrational transition) and 3e-31 for rotational?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for the bond length. Let me check.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms. An angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So R = 2e-10 m.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of I. Let me re-calculate I.

I = μ r².

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m. So r squared is 4e-20 m².

I = 3.018e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2072e-46 kg·m².

Yes, correct.

Wait, then why is the calculated momentum not matching the options? Maybe I should double-check the formula for the rotational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the rigid rotor model, which I think the non-rigid rotor model is an extension. Wait, the question says the non-rigid rotor model, but the bond length is given as fixed (2 angstroms). Hmm, perhaps in this case, the model is treated as a rigid rotor. So the rotational energy is as calculated.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state, but can transition to a higher rotational state. So the photon's energy is the rotational energy. But in that case, the momentum is 3e-31 Ns, which is not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the rotation-vibration coupling, where the molecule undergoes a transition that involves both rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure about the energy levels in that case.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy again.

E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. Hmm, that's correct.

p_photon = E / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, which is about twice as small as this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy.

Wait, wait. The angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. Is that the correct frequency to use for the vibrational transition?

Wait, in the quantum harmonic oscillator model, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) h w. So the transition from n=0 to n=1 requires energy h w.

So I think my calculation of E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14= 2.65e-19 J is correct.

But perhaps the question is not about vibrational energy, but about rotational energy. But that gives a much smaller momentum, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the total energy difference of both a vibrational and a rotational transition. But that would require both to occur, so the photon's energy would be the sum of the two, but that's even larger. So I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I should have used the reduced mass correctly. The reduced mass μ is (m_x * m_y)/(m_x +m_y). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but for the rotational energy, μ is in kg, r is in meters, so I is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should have used the rotational constant in terms of the bond strength, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy in terms of the rotational constant B, which is given in cm^-1, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should compute the rotational constant B in terms of energy.

B (in energy) = h c / (4 π² I), where c is the speed of light. So B = hc/(4 π² I).

Wait, let me compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

4 π² I = 4 * (pi^2) * 1.2072e-46 ≈ 47.64e-46 = 4.764e-45.

So B = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (4.764e-45).

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divided by 4.764e-45 → 1.9878e-25 /4.764e-45 ≈ 4.175e19 J.

Wait, but that can't be right. Rotational constants are usually much smaller in energy. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is B = ħ²/(2 I), where B is in J.

Wait, yes, if E_rot = B J(J+1), then B is in Joules. So using E_rot = (ħ² J(J+1))/(2 I).

So for J=1, E_rot = (ħ² * 2)/(2 I) = ħ²/(I).

Which is the same as before.

But I have the same problem as before: the photon's momentum is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the photon's energy differently. Like, perhaps the photon causes a transition that involves both rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure about the energy levels in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon causing the molecule to transition to the next higher energy state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. But then, perhaps the energy difference is the sum of the rotational and vibrational differences? That would be higher than either, but not sure.

Wait, but if the next state is the next available state, which would be the rotational one, since it requires less energy. So why isn't that matching any options?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon to cause a transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which in this case is the vibrational state, because the rotational state would require a photon with momentum of 3e-31, which isn't an option.

But the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range, which is about four orders higher than our vibrational calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me recompute E_photon for vibrational transition.

E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) e(-34 +14) = 26.504e-20 J → 2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg·m/s → 8.8347e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest option is A: 1.9e-28 and D:1.4e-28. But 8.8e-28 is about 6 times larger than option A.

So perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Let's think about other possibilities.

Wait a minute, perhaps the angular frequency given is the vibrational frequency, but the question is about the rotational transition. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition, but I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using the formula E = (J (J+1)) * ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency. But I don't have ω_rot given. Hmm.

Alternatively, the rotational energy can be expressed in terms of the moment of inertia and angular velocity. E_rot = I ω² (J (J+1))/2. But without knowing ω_rot, I can't proceed.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to look at the options again. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy again.

E_rot = h²/(8 π² I c) * c, perhaps? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: The rotational energy levels can be given by E_rot = (ħ² J(J+1))/(2I).

So, for J=1, E_rot is (ħ² * 2)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So, E_rot = ( (h/(2 pi))² ) / I = h²/(4 pi² I).

Which is what I had before.

But perhaps I should compute I in a different way. Maybe I should have used the bond length in meters correctly. R is 2 angstroms which is 2e-10 meters. So r squared is 4e-20 m², correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute I in g·cm², because often the rotational constant is expressed in cm^-1 when using wavenumbers.

Wait, 1 g·cm² = 1e-7 kg·m². So I in g·cm² would be I = 1.2072e-46 kg·m² / 1e-7 = 1.2072e-39 g·cm².

Then, the rotational constant B is given by B = h/(8 pi² I c), where I is in g·cm² and c is speed of light in cm/s.

Wait, let me compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s = 6.626e-34 kg·m²/s.

c = 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

I = 1.2072e-39 g·cm² = 1.2072e-42 kg·m².

Wait, wait, no: 1 g = 1e-3 kg, 1 cm = 1e-2 m. So 1 g·cm² = (1e-3 kg) * (1e-2 m)^2 = 1e-7 kg·m².

So I = 1.2072e-46 kg·m² = 1.2072e-46 / 1e-7 = 1.2072e-39 g·cm².

So B = h/(8 pi² I c).

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

8 pi² I c = 8 * (9.8696) * (1.2072e-39 g·cm²) * (3e10 cm/s).

Compute denominator:

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.2072e-39 ≈ 95.33e-39 =9.533e-38.

Multiply by c (3e10 cm/s): 9.533e-38 *3e10 =2.8599e-27.

So denominator is 2.8599e-27.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 2.8599e-27 ≈ 2.317e-7 cm^-1.

But B is in wavenumbers (cm^-1), and the energy is E = h c B.

So E_rot = h c B = 6.626e-34 *3e8 m/s * 2.317e-7 cm^-1.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here, because B is in cm^-1, but I'm mixing units.

Alternatively, since we're calculating B in cm^-1, E_rot would be h c B.

So E_rot = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) * (2.317e-7 cm^-1).

Wait, but cm^-1 is 1/cm, so we need to convert cm^-1 to m^-1.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 2.3e-27 Ns.

Wait, let's compute the rotational energy in terms of p_photon.

E_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

p_photon = E_rot / c = 9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the vibrational energy, leading to 8.8e-28 Ns, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, but the energy is h (w/2pi) instead of h w. Because sometimes angular frequency is given as w = 2 pi f, so the photon's energy would be E = h f = h (w/(2 pi)).

Ah! That could be the mistake. If the given w is the angular frequency (w = 2 pi f), then the energy is E = h f = h (w/(2 pi)).

So E_photon = h * (w/(2 pi)).

Let me recalculate.

w =4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = 6.626e-34 * (4e14 / (2 pi)).

So 4e14 / (2 pi) = 4e14 /6.2832 ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

Then, E_photon = 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

Then, p_photon = E_photon /c =4.22e-20 /3e8 ≈1.407e-28 kg·m/s → 1.407e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

That's very close. So perhaps this is the correct answer.

Ah, I see where I went wrong! The given w is the angular frequency, so to get the photon's energy, I should have used E = h * (w/(2 pi)), not h *w.

So the correct calculation is E_photon = h * w/(2 pi) = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (2 pi).

Which gives approximately 4.22e-20 J.

Then, p_photon = E_photon /c ≈ 1.4e-28 Ns.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest energy state for both rotational ($J=0$) and vibrational ($n=0$) motions. The next lowest energy state could involve either a rotational transition ($J=1$) or a vibrational transition ($n=1$). The energy difference for these transitions is calculated, and the photon's momentum is determined based on the energy of the transition.

### Key Calculations:

1. **Reduced Mass ($\mu$):**
   The reduced mass of the molecule is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y}
   \]
   Substituting $M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}$ and $M_y = 2 \, \text{amu}$:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms ($1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$):
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia ($I$):**
   The moment of inertia is given by:
   \[
   I = \mu \cdot r^2,
   \]
   where $r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}$. Substituting:
   \[
   I = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \cdot 4 \times 10^{-20} = 1.2072 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Transition:**
   The rotational energy levels are quantized as:
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2 J(J+1)}{2I},
   \]
   where $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$. For $J=0 \to J=1$, the energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]
   Substituting $\hbar^2 = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2 \approx 1.112 \times 10^{-68} \, \text{J}^2\text{s}^2$ and $I = 1.2072 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2$:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1.112 \times 10^{-68}}{1.2072 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]
   This value is much smaller than any of the given options, so the rotational transition is unlikely.

4. **Vibrational Energy Transition:**
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega,
   \]
   where $\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}$. The energy difference for $n=0 \to n=1$ is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega.
   \]
   Substituting $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]
   This value is larger than the given options, so the vibrational transition is also unlikely.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   The angular frequency $\omega$ is given in radians per second, and the photon's energy is related to frequency $f$ by:
   \[
   E_{\text{photon}} = h f = h \frac{\omega}{2\pi}.
   \]
   Substituting $\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}$:
   \[
   f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{6.2832} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
   \]
   The photon's energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{photon}} = h f = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 6.366 \times 10^{13} \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   The corresponding momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct momentum of the photon is approximately $1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}$, which matches option **D**.
