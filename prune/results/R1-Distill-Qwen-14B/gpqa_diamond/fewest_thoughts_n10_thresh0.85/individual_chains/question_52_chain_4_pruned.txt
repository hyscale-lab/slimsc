Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temp drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”so, when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of different energy levels in atoms is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to the exponential of (E2 - E1)/(k*T), right? So the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight. It's actually (n2 / n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Oh wait, no, it's the other way around. The number of atoms in a higher energy level is less than those in a lower one, so the ratio depends on the energy difference and temperature.

Wait, so the ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, where level 1 is lower energy than level 2. So, the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because for level 2 being higher, the exponential would have a negative exponent if you take E2-E1. Wait, maybe I should write the formula correctly.

The Boltzmann equation: n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if i is level 2 and j is level 1, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Therefore, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

But wait, the question states that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So, when the star is spotted, the Teff is lower (5500 K), and this causes the ratio to drop. So, in the un-spotted case, with higher Teff (6000 K), the ratio would be higher.

So, the factor by which the ratio changes (no spots vs spots) is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_un) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_sp) ) ]

Wait, the g factors (statistical weights) are the same in both cases, since they're the same atom and same levels. So the g1/g2 terms would cancel. So the ratio simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T_un) - 1/(T_sp) ] )

But wait, no, wait. Let me think. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), because in the equation above, n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no. Let me double-check the formula.

Let me make sure. The standard Boltzmann distribution is:

n_j = (g_j / Q) * exp( -E_j/(k T) )

Where Q is the partition function.

So, when you take the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Since E2 > E1 (level 2 is higher), (E2-E1) is positive. So as T increases, the exponent becomes larger, and the ratio (n1/n2) increases. So in the un-spotted case, higher T leads to higher ratio. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Which makes sense because when T drops, (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent becomes larger, so the ratio increases? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T). So when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so the exponent is larger. So exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) is larger, so n1/n2 is larger. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), what happens to the ratio?

Wait, wait. Let me plug in some numbers. Suppose E2-E1 is positive, say 1000 K * k. Then, (E2-E1)/(k T) is 1000 / T.

At T = 6000 K: 1000/6000 ~ 0.1667.

At T = 5500 K: 1000/5500 ~ 0.1818.

So the exponent is higher at the lower temperature. So exp(0.1818) is larger than exp(0.1667), meaning n1/n2 is larger at lower T. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. That contradicts the calculation.

Wait, that's confusing. So maybe I got the ratio backwards. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, that doesn't fit with my earlier analysis. So perhaps I messed up the ratio.

Wait, maybe the ratio they're talking about is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2? Or perhaps I have the energy levels reversed.

Wait, let me reevaluate. Let me define level 1 as the lower energy level, level 2 as higher. So, when the temperature is higher, more atoms are in higher energy levels. So, the population of level 2 (n2) increases as T increases. Therefore, n2/n1 would increase when T increases. So n1/n2 would decrease when T increases.

Wait, no. Let's see. If T increases, then the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller because T is bigger. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is smaller. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So as T increases, that exponential term decreases, so n1/n2 decreases. So n2/n1 increases.

Wait, so if the star's effective temperature increases, the ratio n1/n2 (lower level/ higher level) decreases. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K). So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 would be higher.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, that's conflicting. Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in how the ratio is expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength. The transition is 1448 Angstrom, which is in the far UV. Hmm, Ti has lines in the UV, so perhaps this is a UV
