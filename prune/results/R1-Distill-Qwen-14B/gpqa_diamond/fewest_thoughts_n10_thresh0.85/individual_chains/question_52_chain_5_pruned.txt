Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars with dark spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, photospheric effective temperature and all that.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how spots affect the effective temperature. Oh right, dark spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, so when a large part is covered, the overall observed temperature decreases. But why does the Teff go down? Because the spots emit less, so the average flux is lower.

But the main question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when there are spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The transition between these levels is at 1448 Ã…, which is in the near UV I think. And the photosphere is in LTE, so I can use the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population ratio of two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*T)), where n is the number of atoms in each level, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait a second, the spots are cooler, but the rest of the photosphere is the same? Or does the presence of spots change the overall effective temperature, which is what's used for the ratio? Hmm, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere's effective temperature is that, which probably is the average based on the spotted area.

But wait, another thought: the photosphere itself isn't uniformly at 5500 K. The spots are cooler, and the rest is 6000 K. So maybe the observed Teff is a combination of the two regions. But in terms of the problem, when considering the photosphere as a whole, the effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, but the question says to examine the ratio in the stellar photosphere when the star has spots. So perhaps each region contributes, but the photosphere is a mix. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the temperature of the photosphere as being 5500 K, but that doesn't sound right because the spots are part of the photosphere.

Wait the question says, when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. Then when 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the star's overall brightness decreases, but the photosphere itself has some areas hotter and some cooler. But when it comes to the spectrum, the emitted light comes from all parts, but each part contributes according to its temperature.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the problem again. The ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio is n2/n1, and this ratio is lower when the star has spots. So, when the spots are present, the ratio is lower than when they're not.

The question is, by what factor does the ratio without spots exceed the ratio with spots. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So (n2/n1)_with_spots < (n2/n1)_no_spots. Therefore, the factor would be (
