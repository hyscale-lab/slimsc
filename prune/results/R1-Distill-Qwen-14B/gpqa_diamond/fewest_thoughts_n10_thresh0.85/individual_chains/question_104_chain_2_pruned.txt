Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we see that as a shift in the spectral lines.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that should simplify things.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method detects the velocity of the star, right? So the semi-amplitude of the velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital parameters. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / P ) )^(1/3)

But wait, since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are solar-mass, M_p is much smaller than M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and for circular orbits, e is 0, so (1-e²)^(1/2) is 1. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Another approach I remember is that the RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for K is also sometimes written in terms of the planet's orbital period, semi-major axis, and the star's mass.

Wait, here's another formula: K = (v) where v is the velocity semi-amplitude. And another formula I remember is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's think about Kepler's third law. The orbital period P depends on the semi-major axis a and the masses involved. For a circular orbit, Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) ) a³. Since M_p is much smaller, we can approximate it as P² = (4π²/(G M_star)) a³.

But wait, the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which is proportional to the star's velocity. K is given by (v) where v is the velocity amplitude. So K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) ) )

Since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, M_p is the same for both planets (since both are Neptune-like
