Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me break it down.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction separately.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN. I remember that ketones reacting with HCN or its equivalents can form cyanohydrins. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So this is probably a nucleophilic addition reaction.

In the product, I see a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So the product is a cyanohydrin. The general reaction for ketones plus HCN (or CN-) in the presence of an acid catalyst gives a cyanohydrin. So for that, the ketone would add HCN across the carbonyl, forming a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group on the adjacent carbon.

So the reagent A is probably an acid catalyst. Because I recall that the formation of cyanohydrins from ketones typically uses an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B) or perhaps something else.

Wait, but NaCN is a good nucleophile. Without an acid, would the reaction proceed? I think acid catalysis helps in the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So maybe A is H3O+? But wait, looking at the options, some have A as NaHSO3. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- and Na+ ions. HSO3^- can act as an acid. Alternatively, sometimes in such reactions, H2SO3 (sulfuric acid as a dehydrating agent) is used, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. The first step is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A to form the cyanohydrin. So the reagent A is possibly the acid catalyst. So options for A could be H3O+ (option A or B), or NaHSO3 (options C and D).

Wait, but does the reaction require an acid? Or maybe another condition? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The general equation is:

RCOR' + HCN â†’ RCH(OH)CN + R'OH

But wait, I think the reaction is more likely to proceed with an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the acid protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, and so on.

So if A is H3O+ (proton source), that would make sense. So looking at the options, A could be H3O+ which is in options A and B. Alternatively, if A is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ (since HSO3^- is a weak acid), that could also work.

Wait, but in the product, the hydroxyl is adjacent to the nitrile. So it's a secondary alcohol. That makes sense because the ketone is a secondary carbonyl.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A is likely an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+.

But then, looking at the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with reagent B in H2O to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the nitrile group (-CN) is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So we're going from nitrile to carboxylic acid, which is a typical oxidation reaction.

Wait, but nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The common reagents for this oxidation include things like KMnO4 under acidic or basic conditions, or other strong oxidizing agents like H2O2 with certain catalysts.

But in the presence of water, what's commonly used? Let me think. I think that KMnO4 in acidic conditions can oxidize nitriles to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, using H2O2 with a catalyst like H+ or something else.

But looking at the options, for reagent B, the choices are HCl, CH3COOH, or HCl again, or CH3COOH.

Wait, in the options, option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, but in the second reaction, reagent B is used with H2O. So the reaction is probably an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis or oxidation.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. But the hydrolysis of nitriles to acids typically requires strong acid and heat, like H2SO4, H2O, and heat. Alternatively, using a catalyst like HgSO4 or something else.

Wait, but oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires stronger conditions. Let me think: KMnO4 in acidic conditions, maybe. Another approach is the hydrolysis of the nitrile. Wait, nitrile hydrolysis can produce a carboxylic acid under strong acidic conditions with perhaps heat.

Alternatively, the nitrile group can be oxidized. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4, H2O, and acid.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile has been oxidized. So what reagents are used for that?

I think KMnO4 in acidic conditions (like H2SO4) can oxidize nitriles to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, using H2O2 as an oxidizing agent in acidic conditions.

Looking at the options, reagent B is either HCl (like in option A) or CH3COOH (acetic acid, in options B and D).

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent B is used along with H2O. So perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, no, hydrolysis of nitriles typically gives amines or acids, depending on the conditions. Wait, hydrolysis under basic conditions gives a carboxylate, and under acidic conditions gives a carboxylic acid. So if the reaction is hydrolysis, then using an acid would make sense.

But wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the nitrile is hydrolyzed in acidic conditions. Let me think: for nitrile hydroly
