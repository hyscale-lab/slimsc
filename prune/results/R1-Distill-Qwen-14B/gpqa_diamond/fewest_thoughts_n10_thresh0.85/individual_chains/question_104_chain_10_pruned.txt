Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the key factors here must be the Doppler shifts they cause.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I thought that the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit, and the orbital period. Oh, but wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (1-e²)^(0.5) )) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / (P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I should recall the simplified version. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ). But since both stars have the same mass, and the planets are similar to Neptune, perhaps their masses are the same. Also, since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so that term (1-e²)^0.5 is 1.

Wait, but the question states both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. Also, the stars have same mass, so M_star is same. The inclination i? Hmm, but the problem doesn't state that the inclinations are the same, but the RV method is most sensitive when the orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), giving maximum velocity. But since both are detected, perhaps we can assume the same sin i for both, or that it's a factor we don't need to consider as it's the same for both.

Wait, but in this problem, the detected Doppler shifts (K) are different. So the K for planet #1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for planet #2 it's 7. So K_1 =5, K_2=7.

We need to find the ratio P_2 / P_1. So let's think about how K relates to the period.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * c)) ) * (1 / sin i )

Wait, maybe I should look up the precise formula. I think the correct formula is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, and assuming sin i is same (i.e., same inclination), then K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Taking the ratio between K1 and K2:

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, let me think. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * C, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * C, where C is a constant (same for both planets as M_p, M_star, sin i are same).

So K1 / K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can rearrange this to find P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, wait no: Let me write it properly.

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → K = C * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

So K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Take the ratio: K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no.

Wait, K1 = C / P1^ (1/3)

K2 = C / P2^ (1/3)

Divide K1 by K2:

K1/K2 = (P2^1/3) / (P1^1/3) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, but K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So (K1/K2) =5/7.

So (P2/P1)= (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 = 0.364 * P1 → P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364. So the ratio P2/P1 is ~0.36, meaning that P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1. Or, the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? Hmm, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but
