Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I need to find the maximum speed of the mass. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Wait, in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is determined by the amplitude and the spring constant. The formula is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? But wait, that's non-relativistic. Here it's relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The energy equations change because of special relativity. The total energy of a relativistic particle isn't just kinetic plus potential as it is in the classical case. Oh right, in relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², just like in the classical case. But the kinetic energy is different. Wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv²; that's only for non-relativistic speeds. Instead, the total energy E is gamma m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy would be the sum of kinetic and potential, but wait, in the harmonic oscillator, when it's at maximum displacement (x=A), the kinetic energy is zero, and all the energy is potential. Then, as it moves towards the equilibrium point, the potential energy converts to kinetic, which would be maximum there.

So at x=0 (equilibrium), the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², right? Because that's the potential energy when x=A. But wait, no, in the relativistic case, the potential is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic is different.

Wait, no, actually, I think in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the potential energy (½kA²). Because when x = A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is stored in the potential. Then, as the mass moves, potential converts to kinetic.

So E = mc² + ½ k A². But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, in the non-relativistic case, E is ½kA², which is the sum of kinetic and potential at various points. But in relativity, when the mass is at maximum displacement, all energy is potential, so E = ½kA² + mc². No, wait, that can't be. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is ½k A², but when you add relativity, maybe E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the conservation of energy. So, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement x=A, its velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. So E = ½ k A². Wait, no, that's the non-relativistic case. In the relativistic case, does the potential energy expression change? Probably not, but the kinetic energy does. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the total energy in the relativistic case includes both the rest mass energy and the potential. So when the mass is at x=A, its velocity is zero, so the total energy is E = mc² + ½ k A². Then, when it's at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So at that point, E = gamma m c². Because at x=0, the potential is zero, so all energy is kinetic.

So setting these equal: gamma m c² = mc² + ½ k A². So gamma equals 1 + (½ k A²)/(m c²). 

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v_max is the speed when gamma is maximum. So solving for v_max.

Let me write that equation: gamma = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

Wait, but wait, the equation is gamma = 1 + (½ k A²)/(m c²). So ½ k A² divided by m c squared is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me solve for v. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let's call it beta or something. Let me let b = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So gamma = 1 + b.

But wait, this would require that 1 + b >=1, which makes sense because gamma is always greater than or equal to 1.

So gamma = 1 + b. So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + b.

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root: 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + b)^2.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + b)^2.

So v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + b)^2] = [ (1 + b)^2 -1 ] / (1 + b)^2.

Expanding the numerator: (1 + 2b + b² -1 ) = 2b + b².

So v²/c² = (2b + b²) / (1 + b)^2.

Factor numerator: b(2 + b) / (1 + b)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Alternatively, note that 2b + b² = b(2 + b) = b (1 + (1 + b)).

Wait, not sure. Maybe it's better to write in terms of b.

Wait, perhaps to simplify this expression:

v²/c² = (2b + b²)/(1 + b)^2.

I can factor numerator as b(2 + b) and denominator as (1 + b)^2.

Wait, maybe let me factor numerator as b(2 + b) = b ( (1 + b) + 1 ).

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me compute (1 + b)^2: 1 + 2b + b².

So, 2b + b² = (1 + 2b + b²) -1 = (1 + b)^2 - 1.

So, [ (1 + b)^2 -1 ] / (1 + b)^2 = [ (1 + b)^2 / (1 + b)^2 ] - 1/(1 + b)^2 ) = 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2.

Wait, that's not helpful. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as b(2 + b) = b(1 + b +1).

Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to substitute back b = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, perhaps I can factor the expression differently.

Wait, let me compute:

[2b + b²] = b (2 + b) = b (1 + b + 1).

But I don't see a clear way. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (1 + b)(b) + b.

Wait, not sure. Maybe proceed numerically.

Wait, perhaps I should express v in terms of (1 + b).

Wait, let me try to compute 2b + b²:

2b + b² = b (2 + b) = b (b + 2).

Hmm, maybe another way. Let me try to write the entire expression:

v²/c² = [ b(2 + b) ] / (1 + b)^2.

So, v = c * sqrt( [b (2 + b) ] ) / (1 + b).

Wait, perhaps I can write this as c * sqrt( b (2 + b) ) / (1 + b).

Alternatively, maybe factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me think about the expression [ sqrt( b (2 + b) ) ] / (1 + b).

Hmm, perhaps rewrite it as sqrt( [b (2 + b)] ) / (1 + b).

Wait, perhaps express it as sqrt( b/(1 + b) ) * sqrt( (2 + b)/(1 + b) ) ).

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the substitution.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's compute v_max in terms of b.

We have:

v²/c² = (2b + b²) / (1 + b)^2.

So, v = c * sqrt( (2b + b²) ) / (1 + b).

Let me factor the numerator inside the square root: 2b + b² = b (b + 2).

So,

v = c * sqrt( b (b + 2) ) / (1 + b).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor further. Let me see: b + 2 = (b +1) +1.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor as:

sqrt( b (b + 2) ) = sqrt( (b +1)^2 -1 )

Because (b+1)^2 = b² + 2b +1, so (b+1)^2 -1 = b² + 2b = 2b + b².

So,

sqrt( (b+1)^2 -1 ) = sqrt( (b+1)^2 -1 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (b+1)^2 -1 ) / (1 + b )

= c * sqrt( [ (b+1)^2 -1 ] ) / (b+1 )

= c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(b+1)^2 )

Oh wait, because sqrt(a² - b²) = a sqrt(1 - (b/a)^2 ) when a> b.

Wait, let me think. Let me consider:

sqrt( (b+1)^2 -1 ) = sqrt( (b+1)^2 (1 - 1/(b+1)^2) ) )

= (b+1) * sqrt( 1 - 1/(b+1)^2 )

So then,

v = c * [ (b+1) * sqrt( 1 - 1/(b+1)^2 ) ] / (b+1 )

The (b+1) terms cancel, so:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(b+1)^2 )

Now, substituting back b = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( [ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ] +1 )^2 )

Hmm, let me compute the denominator as [ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) +1 ].

Which is (k A² + 2 m c² )/( 2 m c² )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 2 m c²/(k A² + 2 m c² ) ]^2 )

Wait, because 1/(denominator)^2 is [2 m c²/(k A² + 2 m c² )]^2.

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right way to express it. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )]^2 )

Which is the same as:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + b )]^2 )

Which is the same as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (1 + b )^2 -1 ] / (1 + b )^2 )

Which brings us back to where we were earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I should express it in terms of (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Wait, let me write it as:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 )

Hmm, looking at the answer options, option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Wait, yes. Because option D is:

D) v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which matches what I have here.

Wait, let me recheck the options.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )]^2 )

Yes, that's what I derived.

Now, looking back at the options, let me check each one.

Option A: sqrt(1 + ... ) which would imply a higher speed, but that can't be because in relativity, speed approaches c but doesn't exceed it.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ... )) which seems to not match.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which is invalid here.

Option D is what I derived, so that's the correct answer.

Wait, wait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistakes in the setup?

When x = A, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy. That is, E = mc² + (1/2) k A².

Then, when the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, E = gamma mc². So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + ( (1/2) k A² )/(m c² )

Which simplifies to gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as before.

So solving for gamma, then for v.

So yes, option D is correct.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \). At \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

At \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by the relativistic expression:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is related to the speed \( v \) by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) into this equation, we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
\]

Inverting and rearranging:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** suggests a speed exceeding \( c \), which is unphysical.
- **Option B** has an incorrect denominator structure.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which is invalid here.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
