Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, so I need to find out which is the correct product.

First, I'll start by analyzing the spectral data given. The IR has peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H stretches, maybe from a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester, but since there's a broad peak in the NMR around 10.5 ppm, which is typical for a carboxylic acid's -OH proton, I think it's a carboxylic acid. The other IR peaks at 1610 and 1450 might be due to aromatic C=C stretching.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's likely the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid, broad because it's exchanging.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest a para-substituted ring. So, two protons on the aromatic ring, each as a doublet. The upfield shift (like 7.2 ppm) suggests an electron-donating group, but wait, if it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent, maybe it's a methyl or another group. Wait, but wait—if the carbonyl is at 1720, could it be a benzoic acid? Because the position of the substituent would affect the protons. For example, in para-methyl benzoic acid, the ring protons would be as two doublets. Yeah, that makes sense.
- Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be a CH group attached to something, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl. Like maybe a CH2CH2 group or a substituent on the benzene attached to a CH2COOH or something.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This is a multiplet, probably a CH2 group next to a branching point or another group. Maybe part of a butyl chain.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet—wait, maybe a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps a -CH(CH3) something. Hmm, a doublet with three protons could be a methyl group attached to a CH that's next to another group. Like a sec-butyl group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal CH3, probably from an ethyl or propyl chain.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. The substituent is probably a -COOH group because of the IR and NMR. So the structure would be something like a benzene ring with a COOH group in the para position and another substituent. But looking at the substituent's NMR signals. So the substituent is attached to the benzene and has a structure that gives the other peaks.

The substituent: The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be a CH next to a carbonyl. So maybe it's a propyl group attached to the benzene via a CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, because the 1.7 ppm is m, 2H—maybe a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group or something like that.

Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group attached to the benzene. Let me think: the substituent is a butyl group. The 0.9 ppm t (3H) is the end of an ethyl chain, so maybe a -CH2CH2- group. Let me see, so the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be like benzene with a -COOH in the para position and a sec-butyl group in the para position as well? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the substituent on benzene is a group that includes a carbonyl. Wait, no, the compound is X, which has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl, perhaps making it a ketone or an acid.

Wait, I thought earlier it's a carboxylic acid because of the IR and NMR. So the substituent is a -COOH group attached to the benzene ring. But then, what's the other substituent? Wait, maybe the benzene has two substituents: one -COOH and another group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which suggests that they're para to each other. So if the substituent is -COOH in position 4, then the other substituent would be in position 1, but that might not be possible. Oh wait, maybe the substituent is a group that includes the carbonyl, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative with a substituent in the para position. So if the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOH, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me try to imagine the structure. So the benzene has a -COOH group and a substituent that's a branch. Let's think of it as the benzene ring with a COOH at position 1 and a substituent at position 4, which is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Let me try to draw this out mentally. The benzene ring has a COOH group in the para position relative to another substituent. The substituent is a branched chain. So maybe it's a -CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH3) group. Or perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm, I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR again: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH that's connected to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH, making it a sec-butyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene. Wait, but how does that connect?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH3) group. Let me count the hydrogens. If the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, that might not add up. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group. Wait, maybe it's a propyl group attached to a benzene but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me check the NMR for that. The CH2 attached to the benzene would have protons at lower ppm, maybe around 2.9. The CH(CH2CH3) would have a triplet or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the entire structure. The IR shows a carbonyl, which is either an acid or another carbonyl group. The NMR has a broad singlet at 10.5, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid's -OH. So, if it's a benzoic acid derivative, the substituent on the benzene would be another group. Let's say, the benzene has a -COOH group and another substituent, maybe a substituent that's a butyl group or a branched alkyl.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggests a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO- group. Wait, but the substituent is on the benzene, so maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a propyl group attached to a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a -CH2-COOH group attached. But then the substituent would be in the para position relative to the COOH group.

But the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, which suggests that the substituent is in the para position relative to COOH. So, perhaps the structure is 4-(substituent)benzoic acid.

Now, looking at the substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. So maybe a CH2 group next to a COOH. But then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH at 2.9. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, but if it's a propyl or butyl group, the substituent would be longer. Let me think: maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that would be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be a CH attached to the benzene, which has a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a -COOH group at one position and a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group at the para position.

Wait, but let me count the protons. The substituent would be -CH(CH2CH2CH3). So the CH would have one H, but the NMR shows 1H at 2.9 ppm. That fits. The CH2 groups would have their own signals. The CH2CH2CH3 part would have the 0.9 ppm triplet as the terminal CH3, the 1.4 ppm doublet as the CH2 adjacent to the CH, and the 1.7 ppm as the next CH2. So that seems to fit.

So the structure of compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that's one possibility.

Now, the reaction: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus with HI is typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, that's not a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the compound has an est
