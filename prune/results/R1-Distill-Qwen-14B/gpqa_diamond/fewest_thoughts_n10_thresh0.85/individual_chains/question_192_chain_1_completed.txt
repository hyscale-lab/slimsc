Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both bigger than R, and there's an angle theta between l and s.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. Let me visualize it. So, imagine a big sphere (the conductor) and a smaller cavity inside it. The cavity isn't at the center because it's shifted by s. Inside this cavity, there's a charge +q. Now, point P is outside the big conductor, so the field there would depend on the charges outside, right?

But wait, the conductor is uncharged. Oh right, because when you have a conductor and you put a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's outer surface must adjust to keep the charge neutral. Wait, no, wait. The conductor is initially uncharged. When you put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Let me think, when you have a conducting shell with a cavity, and you put a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an equal and opposite charge, and the outer surface will have none because the shell is neutral. Wait, no, the shell is uncharged. So the inner surface would have a charge -q, but wait, wait, no. The conductor itself is neutral. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. But the conductor as a whole is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I got that wrong. Because the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q, because the conductor's material's free electrons will move to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, no. No, wait. The conductor is neutral overall. So the inner surface has a charge -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge zero (-q + (+q) = 0). Hmm, that makes sense.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to all the charges outside the point P's Gaussian surface. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the total charge outside would be +q. But wait, wait, no, the outer surface's charge would be +q? Because the conductor is neutral, so inner is -q, outer is +q.

Wait, but when you're outside the conductor, you're outside both the conductor and the cavity. So the electric field at P would be as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor, but wait, no. Because the outer surface's charge distributes spherically symmetrically if there are no other charges nearby. Wait, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface would have a spherically symmetric charge distribution. So the field outside would be the same as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but wait a second. The cavity is off-center. Oh, right, the cavity is shifted by a distance s from the center. So the charge +q is inside the cavity, but the cavity is not at the center. So does that affect the outer surface's charge distribution?

Hmm. Because the charge +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge distribution. But because the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface's charge distribution won't be symmetric. So the inner surface's charge will be more on the side opposite to the cavity, or something. But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution must still be symmetric because the conductor is a sphere and any external fields would cause the charges to rearrange, but in this case, there's no external charge except the +q inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor.

Wait, wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform only if the charge inside the cavity is at the center. Because if the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge isn't uniform. But the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge must be uniformly distributed. Because any non-uniformity on the outer surface would cause the field inside the conductor to not be zero, which contradicts the conductor's properties.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The conductor's inner surface must have a charge distribution that exactly cancels the field from the +q inside the cavity. So if the +q is off-center, the inner surface's charge will be non-uniform. But the outer surface must still have a uniform charge distribution because there's no external field to perturb it. So the outer surface's charge is spherically symmetric, with a uniform surface charge density.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, the inner surface (-q) and outer surface (+q) sum to zero. But wait, that can't be right because then the total charge would be zero, but the outer surface would have +q. So when you're outside the conductor, the field would be due to the +q on the outer surface, acting as if it were at the center.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so the field there is due to the outer surface's charge. Since the outer surface is a sphere with charge +q, the field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), where L is the distance from the center to P. Because the field outside a uniformly charged sphere is same as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

So looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). That seems to fit.

But wait, let me think again. The presence of the off-center cavity might affect the outer charge distribution. Wait, but the outer surface is a conducting sphere and the only charge on it is +q. So the field outside would be as if the charge were a point charge at the center. So yes, the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²).

Wait, but the problem gives some other variables like l, s, and theta. How do they factor in?

Ah, maybe I'm missing something. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. The angle between l and s is theta. So maybe I should model this as the field due to the charge in the cavity, but considering the induced charges.

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface is +q, and it's spherically symmetric, the field outside is as if the charge is at the center. So the position of P relative to the cavity's center might not matter as much as its distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but let me imagine. The conductor's outer surface is a sphere with +q. So the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L², regardless of where the cavity is. Because the outer charge is uniformly distributed.

So the correct answer would be option B, which is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²).

Another way to think about it: Using Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface outside the conductor. The total charge enclosed is the +q on the outer surface. So the flux through the surface is E * 4πL² = q/(ε₀). So E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²).

So the answer is option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor and Cavity Setup**: The spherical conductor of radius $R$ is initially uncharged. A small spherical cavity of radius $r$ is present inside the conductor, with its center separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.

2. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (closest to the cavity) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the total charge.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The point $P$ lies outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field outside a charged spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface and not on the distribution of charges inside the conductor. Since the outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, the electric field at $P$ is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

4. **Gauss's Law Application**: Using Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through a Gaussian surface of radius $L$ centered at the conductor's center is:
   \[
   \Phi = E \cdot 4\pi L^2 = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}.
   \]
   Solving for $E$, we find:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Relevance of Other Variables**: While the problem introduces variables such as $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, these do not affect the electric field at $P$ because the outer surface of the conductor ensures spherical symmetry in the charge distribution. The field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center.

Thus, the correct expression for the electric field at $P$ is given by option **B**.

Answer: B
