Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule's energy states. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. Alright, I'll need to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model, treats the molecule as a rotating dumbbell with a vibrating bond. So the energy levels here involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, wait—the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think this might involve a change in either the vibrational or rotational quantum numbers, or maybe both.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I believe the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state. For a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state is usually the state where the vibrational quantum number v is 0, and the rotational quantum number J is also 0 or 1, depending on the molecule. But wait, for a rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0, but in a non-rigid rotor, I'm not sure. Maybe the model here is similar to the rigid rotor's approach but with some considerations for bond length changes.

Wait, so the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh right, that's the first excited state. So the molecule is in the ground state, and we want it to move to the next state, which is probably the first excited vibrational state, or maybe a change in rotational state.

But wait, the photon absorption would cause a transition. In quantum mechanics, when a photon is absorbed, it must supply the exact energy difference between the two states. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait a second, but in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve changes in both rotation and vibration. But in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and the vibrational levels as well. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be either v=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state). But which transition has the lower energy?

Because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon should cause the transition to the state with the least energy increase possible. So I should compare the energy gaps for these possible transitions.

Wait, the energy levels for vibration and rotation are different. The vibrational energy gap is given by the quantum harmonic oscillator formula: E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω. The rotational energy is from the rigid rotor: E_rot = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

So for the transition, the molecule could either change v by one (v=0 to v=1) or J by one (J=0 to J=1). But which of these requires less energy? Because the question is about the next lowest energy state, so whichever requires the smaller energy jump.

Wait, but the problem says it's in the fundamental state. So the initial state is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. So I need to calculate the energies for the possible transitions.

So let's calculate both possibilities.

First, calculate the energy difference for the vibrational transition: from v=0 to v=1.

ΔE_vib = E(1) - E(0) = [ (1 + 1/2) ħω ] - [ (0 + 1/2) ħω ] = ħω.

Now, the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1.

ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = [ (1*(1+1) ) * ħ²/(2I) ] - [ (0*(0+1) ) * ħ²/(2I) ] = (2 * ħ²)/(2I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

So which is smaller between ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot? If ħω is less than ħ²/I, then the vibrational transition is lower in energy. But in reality, for diatomic molecules, the rotational transitions are usually in the microwave region, and vibrational in infrared. Since infrared photons have higher energy than microwaves, maybe the vibrational transition requires higher energy than the rotational. But wait, that depends on the specific molecule.

Wait, let me compute both ΔE values numerically.

Given:

Masses Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

Angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So let's compute I, the moment of inertia: I = μ R².

I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = approx 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot: ħ²/(I) where ħ is h/(2π). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. The rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). For transition from J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rot = ( (2 * ħ²)/(2I) ) - 0 = (2 * ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ² / I.

So ΔE_rot = (1
