Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass in such a system. 

Alright, the setup: it's a one-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, so the force is F = -kx. But wait, it's relativistic, so I can't use the classical equations directly. I remember that in relativity, momentum isn't just mv; it's gamma times mv, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the classical case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv²_max. Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which would be option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are different.

Relativistically, the total energy includes rest mass energy. The total energy E should be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy. But in a harmonic oscillator, the energy oscillates between kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement, all energy is potential, and at the equilibrium position (x=0), it's all kinetic.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, I think the equation of motion is different. The force is still F = -kx, but the momentum isn't just m v. So, the equation would involve the relativistic momentum. The equation of motion for a relativistic oscillator is probably more complex than the classical one.

Alternatively, maybe energy considerations are a better approach. The total energy in the system is the sum of the rest energy and the oscillatory energy. Hmm, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But relativistically, I'm not sure if that's the same.

Wait, let's think about the energy. At the maximum amplitude A, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is zero. All the energy is potential, which would be (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of rest energy and classical mechanical energy. Or wait, maybe in this context, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, perhaps the total mechanical energy E (kinetic + potential) in the oscillator is the same as in the classical case, but the kinetic energy is gamma m c² - m c². Because kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1) m c². So when the mass is at x=0 (the equilibrium point), all the energy is kinetic, and E = (gamma) m c².

Wait, no. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy and the mechanical energy. Or maybe the mechanical energy is the same as before, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Let me try to model this. The total energy E should be the sum of the rest energy and the mechanical energy. Wait, no, in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA², which is all potential at maximum displacement. But in relativity, I think the energy stored in the spring is the same as the classical case because the force is F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)k x². But the kinetic energy is relativistic. So at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, which is (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all that energy is kinetic, but relativistic.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So if the maximum potential energy is (1/2)k A², then at the equilibrium point, that energy would have to equal the kinetic energy.

So, (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c². Because the total mechanical energy is the same as the maximum potential energy.

So, solving for gamma: (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) 

Wait, because (1/2 kA^2) = (gamma-1) m c^2 → gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but let me double-check the algebra.

Yes: (gamma -1) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but that might not be correct. Because (gamma -1) equals (k A^2)/(2 m c²), right?

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides
