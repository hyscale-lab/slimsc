Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Oh, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Interesting. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's probably related to their temperatures. Because the peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's Law, right? Which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 equals T2. Got it.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. I'm not sure how that affects luminosity, but maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps it's used in another part, but the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So since both have the same temperature, the luminosity depends on the radius squared.

Wait, so Star_1 has R=1.5 R2. So R1 is 1.5 times R2. So what's the luminosity ratio L1/L2?

Let me compute that. L1 is proportional to R1² * T1⁴, and L2 is R2² * T2⁴. Since T1 = T2, the T part cancels out. So L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5)² = 2.25. So that would suggest the factor is 2.25, which is option A. But wait, the options have A as ~2.25, D is ~2.23, etc. Hmm, but wait, let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that the luminosities were computed assuming blackbody radiation. But wait, the radial velocities are given. How does that come into play? Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh, right! So even if their rest wavelengths are the same, if one is moving towards or away from us, we might observe a different wavelength. But the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm.

Wait, in the problem statement, the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So observed lambda_max. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, perhaps we need to correct for its Doppler shift to find its actual temperature. Because the observed wavelength is different from the rest wavelength.

Wait
