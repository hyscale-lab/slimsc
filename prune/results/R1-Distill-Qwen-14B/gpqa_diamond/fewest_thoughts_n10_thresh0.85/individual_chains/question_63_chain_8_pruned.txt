Okay, so I have this problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the molecule is made of atoms X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about the momentum a photon should have when it's absorbed so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. But wait, what's the next state with the lowest possible energy? Oh, right, when dealing with both rotation and vibration, the energy levels are quantized for each mode.

But wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model—so it's a combination of rotational and vibrational energy states. So the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can go to a higher state. But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm, I think that refers to the next higher energy state, which would be the first excited state. But which comes first—vibrational or rotational changes?

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels combine both rotation and vibration. The energy levels for rotation are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and for vibration, E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy, which would be v=0 and J=0. So the next state would be either an increase in J (rotational excitation) or an increase in v (vibrational excitation).

But the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. Which transition would be the next lowest energy? Because vibrational transitions usually require higher energy than rotational ones. So the photon could cause a rotational transition, which would be a lower energy jump than a vibrational one.

So the molecule is in the state with v=0 and J=0. The next possible state would be either J=1 (since J can only increase by 1) or v=1. But which requires less energy? Because vibrational energy is typically higher than rotational.

Let me think about the energies. The vibrational energy levels are quantized, each step requires h w. The rotational energy difference between J and J+1 is 2 B (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So if B is small, the rotational transitions are lower in energy than vibrational.

So the photon would cause the molecule to go from J=0 to J=1, which is a rotational transition. But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule can change either vibrationally or rotationally, but which has a lower energy increment.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be the next higher energy state, which is either the next rotational state or the first vibrational excitation, whichever requires less energy.
