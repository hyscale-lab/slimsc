Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit.

So the question is comparing two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter periodâ€”three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so if the period is shorter, that means it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. Closer planet, smaller orbit.

They also mention that both have circular orbits. So no eccentricity to worry about. The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. Oh, but same radius. So the stars are more massive but same size? That seems a bit odd because usually more massive stars are larger. Maybe these are subgiant or something.

The key factors for transit probability are the orbital distance and the size of the planet relative to the star. The probability (P) is roughly (R_planet / R_star) squared, multiplied by (a/(2a)) where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, actually, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (d), where d is the impact parameter. But I think the main factors are the relative size of the planet and how likely the orbital plane is aligned to our line of sight.

Wait, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a * (1 + m_star / M_planet)^(1/3)))), no, wait, maybe not. Actually, the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a * sqrt(1 - e^2))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, another approach: the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * sin i)), but since sin i is 1
