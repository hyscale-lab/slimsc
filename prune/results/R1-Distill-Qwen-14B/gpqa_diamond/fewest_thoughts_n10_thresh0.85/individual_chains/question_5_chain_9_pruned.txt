Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator corresponding to a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, let's think this through.

The operator given is P, and it's a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is expressed as (ℏ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. The question is asking for the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n, lying in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ℏ/2.

Wait, so I need to find the eigenvalue equation for the operator P · n, right? Because the operator in the direction n is the dot product of P and the unit vector n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it's like n = (nx, 0, nz), because y-component is zero.

But wait, first, I should probably write down each of the components of P. Let me note them down:

P_x = (ℏ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ℏ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ℏ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each component is a Pauli matrix scaled by ℏ/2.

The operator along direction n would be P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Wait, since n is in x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute. So the operator is (nx P_x + nz P_z) multiplied by something? Wait, no, because each P component is (ℏ/2) times the matrix, so P is the sum of the components multiplied by their respective directions.

Wait, but let me correct that. The direction vector n is a unit vector, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in x-z plane. So the operator P·n is n_x P_x + 0* P_y + n_z P_z. Oh, right, because P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n_y is zero, P_y doesn't contribute.

So, P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But each of these P components is (ℏ/2) times their respective matrices. So plugging in:

P·n = (n_x * (ℏ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]) ) + (n_z * (ℏ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Hmm. Alternatively, factor out ℏ/2:

P·n = (ℏ/2) * [ n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

That simplifies to:

(ℏ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because when you add the two matrices, the (1,1) element is n_z*1, the (1,2) is n_x*1, the (2,1) is n_x*1, and (2,2) is -n_z.

So the matrix for P·n is (ℏ/2) multiplied by the 2x2 matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for the eigenvalue +ℏ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = λ |ψ>, and λ is given as +ℏ/2.

So the matrix equation is:

( ℏ/2 ) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = (ℏ/2) [a'; b']

Divide both sides by ℏ/2 to simplify:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = [a'; b']

So we have the eigenvalue equation:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = [a'; b']

And the eigenvalue λ is 1, since (ℏ/2) * λ = ℏ/2 → λ = 1.

Wait wait, no. Because the operator is (ℏ/2) * matrix, and the eigenvalue is given as +ℏ/2. So (ℏ/2) * matrix multiplied by the eigenvector equals (ℏ/2) times the eigenvector. So the matrix multiplied by eigenvector equals the eigenvector. So the matrix's eigenvalue is 1.

Wait, yes. So the matrix M = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] must have eigenvalue 1.

So, to find [a;b], we need to solve (M - I) * [a;b] = 0.

So the matrix M - I is:

[[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]

The determinant should be zero, but for eigenvectors, we can solve the equations.

Alternatively, write the equations:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a + (-n_z -1 ) b = 0

Let me write these as:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0

Let me try to solve these equations.

From equation 1: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Because n is in x-z plane, no y component.

So, n_x² + n_z² =1.

Let me express a in terms of b.

Let me rearrange equation 1:

a = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] b

Wait, because (n_z -1) = -(1 - n_z), so (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ n_x / (1 - n_z) ) ] b

Wait, maybe it's better to write a in terms of b.

Assuming n_x isn't zero (if n_x is zero, the problem is different, but perhaps we can handle that later).

So a = [n_x/(1 - n_z)] b.

Now substitute into equation 2:

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0

Substitute a:

n_x [n_x/(1 - n_z)] b + (-n_z -1) b =0

Factor out b:

[ (n_x^2)/(1 - n_z) ) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0

Multiply both sides by (1 - n_z) to eliminate denominator:

n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) =0

Compute (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z):

= (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)

= -n_z + n_z^2 -1 + n_z

Simplify: (-n_z + n_z) cancels, so we have n_z² -1.

So:

n_x^2 + n_z^2 -1 = 0

But wait, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, so this becomes 1 -1 =0, which is 0. So this equation holds, meaning that the solution is consistent.

Therefore, the eigenvectors are given by a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b. 

So the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ n_x/(1 - n_z) ; 1 ] * b, but we can parametrize it as [n_x, (1 -n_z)]^T, scaled by some factor.

Wait, because if a = (n_x)/(1 - n_z) * b, then [a; b] = [n_x/(1 - n_z); 1 ] * b. To make it simpler,
