Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 -x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that in 2D, a metric like this might represent some kind of surface. Oh, right, metrics can describe spaces with different properties like curvature.

Pseudosphere... wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid. But wait, in this case, the metric seems to be written in 2D coordinates. So perhaps it's a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some way?

Wait, the question mentions the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudospheres have infinite area, don't they? Because if you think about it, as you go further out, the surface area just keeps increasing. But wait, maybe the metric here has some kind of cutoff?

Looking at the metric: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so as long as x² + y² < 4, this is positive. Once x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric blows up. So the space described by this metric is only defined where x² + y² <4. So maybe the region is a disk of radius 2, since 4 is 2 squared. Oh, because 4 is 2², so radius 2.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface of revolution. Oh wait, maybe this metric is for a 2D surface that is topologically a sphere but with negative curvature. Or is it a hyperbolic plane?

Wait, the metric resembles that of a hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic geometry has negative curvature. But what about the area? The hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but if this metric is defined only over a certain range, does that change things?

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Wait, pseudosphere is a surface with finite area and infinite perimeter. But how does that apply here?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the hyperbolic plane and a pseudosphere. The hyperbolic plane is a 2D space with constant negative curvature and has infinite area. But when you have a pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, it's a surface embedded in 3D space with finite area but infinite perimeter.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm. Or maybe it's referring to the area of the surface described by the given metric.

Wait, the metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me think about the geometry here. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so the region where x² + y² <4 is allowed. So it's a disk of radius 2 in x-y coordinates. But what's the area of this surface?

Wait, the area of a surface in 2D is computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the coordinates. But for a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric here is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². Since both dx² and dy² have the same coefficient, the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² ?

Wait, no, because for a metric in 2D, the off-diagonal terms are zero, so the determinant is just (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²), but since g_xy is zero, it's g_xx * g_yy. Here, g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 -x² -y²), so determinant is (32/(4 -x² -y²))².

Wait, so the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, but in this case, the determinant is (32/(4 -x² -y²))². So sqrt of that is 32/(4 -x² -y²). So dA = [32/(4 -x² -y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but the maximum allowed x² + y² is 4, so the integration domain is x² + y² <4. So the area A is the integral over this disk of the area element.

So A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, integrated over x² + y² <4.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can switch to polar coordinates. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes (4 - r²), so the integrand becomes 32/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ.

So A = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

The θ integral is 2π, so A = 2π ∫(0 to 2) [32 r/(4-r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r²; then du/dr = -2r. So -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r/(4-r²)] dr = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) ) = 32 * ∫ (-du/2)/u.

So 32 * ∫ (-du/2u) = -16 ∫ (1/u) du = -16 ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2. When r=2, u=4-4=0. Oh wait, that's a problem because u approaches zero as r approaches 2. So the integral from 0 to 2 would be from u=4 to u=0. The substitution needs to be carefully considered.

Wait, when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from above. Let me think about the limits.

So when r=0: u=4.

When r=2: u=0.

So the integral in terms of u is from u=4 down to u=0.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2) /u ] = 32 * [ (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du ) ]

Which is 32 * ( (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0 )

= 32 * ( (-1/2) ( ln 0 - ln4 ) )

Wait, but ln0 is negative infinity. So (ln0 - ln4) is negative infinity.

So the integral becomes 32 * (-1/2) ( -infty - ln4 ) = 32 * (1/2) ( infty + ln4 ). Which would go to infinity.

Wait, because ln0 is negative infinity, so ln0 - ln4 is negative infinity. Then you have negative times that, which is positive infinity. So the integral diverges. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says 'infinite' except option D, which is +infty.

But wait, the question is about the pseudosphere. Maybe the metric represents a pseudosphere, but from the calculation, the area is infinite. So the area is infinity, which would make option D the correct answer.

Wait, but pseudospheres, like the tractricoid, have finite area. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. The tractricoid is a surface of revolution with finite area but infinite length. So perhaps the metric given here is that of a pseudosphere, but in this case, the calculation shows that the area is infinite, which would imply that the answer is D) +infty.

But wait, the options don't have +infty as an option unless D is that. Let me check the options again.

Yes, option D is +infty.

So the area is infinite, so the correct answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This metric describes a 2D surface embedded in a region where \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \).

To compute the area, we use the area element \( dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( \det g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\det g = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element transforms to:

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then given by integrating over the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \) (or \( r \in [0, 2] \)):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[ \ln u \right]_4^0 = -16 \left( \ln 0 - \ln 4 \right).
\]

Here, \( \ln 0 \) is \( -\infty \), so \( \ln 0 - \ln 4 = -\infty \). Thus, the integral diverges to \( +\infty \), meaning the area is infinite.

The pseudosphere, as described by this metric, has infinite area. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
