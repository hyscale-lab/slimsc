Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars with spots and exoplanets causing brightness variations. Hmm, I need to figure out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same light curve signal as the spotted star. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when a star has spots, the brightness changes as the spots rotate into and out of view. These spots are cooler than the rest of the star, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. The same effect happens when a planet transits in front of a star, blocking some light.

The question says the star has a radius equal to the Sun. So Rstar is about the same as our Sun, R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of the hemisphere is spots. But since it's one hemisphere, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spots are at 5000K. The temperature difference affects the brightness. I think the flux from the spots is lower because they're cooler.

The problem says that the photometric variations look like an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness change should be the same. So I need to calculate the change in brightness due to the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

Let me break it down. The star's total brightness without spots is based on its entire surface. But with spots, part of the light comes from cooler regions, reducing the overall brightness when those spots are visible.

The brightness variation due to the spots would be the difference between the star's normal brightness and the brightness when the spots are in view. But wait, because only one hemisphere is spotty, as the star rotates, spots come into and out of view. So the maximum and minimum brightness would be when the spot hemisphere is fully facing us or fully away.

Wait, no. The star is observed from Earth, and as it rotates, the spots rotate into and out of the view. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less light, causing a dip. The brightness variation caused by the spots depends on how much less light they emit compared to the rest of the star.

Let me model this. The star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = σTeff^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π D²) ), but since we're looking at relative changes, perhaps I can work with the ratio.

Wait, but when calculating the change in brightness, it's the difference in flux when spots are present versus when they're not. So the spotted hemisphere contributes less flux. Let me think in terms of the area and the temperature difference.

Each spot has a lower temperature, so each spot's flux is (T_spot / T_star)^4 times the flux of the surrounding area. The total flux from the star when the spots are facing us is F = F0 * (1 - f + f*(T_spot^4)/(T_star^4)), where f is the filling factor of the hemisphere.

Wait, no. Let's model it correctly. The entire star emits F0 when the spots are not there (or when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us). When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, part of the star's surface has lower flux.

So, the total flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 * ( (1 - f) * 1 + f * (T_spot^4)/(T_star^4) ), because f fraction of the hemisphere is spots, each emitting (T_spot^4)/(T_star^4) times the normal flux.

So the change in flux is ΔF = F0 * ( (1 - f) + f*(T_spot^4)/(T_star^4) ) - F0 * (1 - f) )? Wait, no. Wait, when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 (1 - f) + F0 f (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 )

Without the spots visible (or when the unspotted side is visible), the flux is F0. So the variation is F = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ) ].

So the change in flux compared to F0 is F - F0 = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ) - 1 ].

Simplify that: F0 [ -f + f (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ) ] = F0 f ( (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ) - 1 )

So the relative change is (F - F0)/F0 = f ( (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ) - 1 )

Wait, but wait, that's the change when the spots are on the side we're seeing. But when the star rotates, the spots come into view and go away. So the maximum dip in brightness would be when the maximum number of spots are visible. But since the star is rotating, the spot area moves, but in this case, it's a hemisphere. So when the star rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (non-spotty) is facing us. The maximum brightness change would be when the entire spotty hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the non-spotty is visible.

Wait, no. The star's brightness varies because when the spotty side is facing us, the spots reduce the flux. The maximum dip is when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible. The minimum dip is when the non-spotty side is fully visible.

Wait, but the problem states that the star is observed to have brightness variations because of the spots. If only one hemisphere is spotty, as it rotates, the spots come into view. The maximum brightness dip would be when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible. So the relative dip would be:

ΔF = F0 [ (1 - f) + f ( (T_spot / T_star )^4 ) ] - F0 (1 - f) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When the entire hemisphere with spots is facing us, the flux is F = F0 * [ (1 - f) * 1 + f * ( (T_spot / T_star )^4 ) ]

But when the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us, the flux is F0, because all areas are at Teff.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere. If you have one hemisphere covered with spots, the other hemisphere is unspotted. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is the sum of the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the spotted part. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the star's surface is a sphere. If one hemisphere is entirely covered with spots, then when that hemisphere is facing us, the entire face we see is spots. The other hemisphere (non-spotty) is on the back.

Wait, no. The problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. Oh, wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So, 20% of the surface area of that hemisphere is spots. So, when that hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the visible area is spots (cooler) and 80% is normal (hotter). But when the other hemisphere is facing us, none of the spots are visible.

Ah, that makes more sense. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, 20% of the visible area is spots, which are cooler. So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotty = F_unspotted * (1 - 0.2) + F_spots * 0.2

Where F_unspotted is the flux from the normal surface (Teff=6000K), and F_spots is the flux from the spots (5000K).

The flux from a spot area is (T_spot / T_star)^4 times the
