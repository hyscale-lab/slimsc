Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf ψ_f  (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not entirely sure what that term signifies, but I think it's about how the boson X interacts with fermions. The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV, and the question is about kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

So, the first thing I remember is that for a boson to decay into fermions, the fermion mass must be less than half the boson's mass. Because in decay processes, the energy and momentum have to be conserved, and each fermion must have enough energy to account for their rest mass. Since the boson is at rest when it decays, each fermion pair (like a quark and antiquark) must each have energy at least equal to their rest mass.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, each fermion in the decay products must have a mass less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV). Because each fermion and anti-fermion would need to have at least their rest mass energy each.

Now, let me list the known fermion masses. I think the top quark is the heaviest, but others vary. Let me recall:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV
- Quarks: up (u), down (d) are light, maybe ~0.003 GeV each. Strange (s) is heavier, around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV), but I might be mixing up with the charm quark. Wait, no, the charm (c) is about 1.5 GeV, and bottom (b) is around 4.5 GeV. Top quark is way heavier, around 173 GeV.

Wait, so for X to decay into a fermion pair, each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV. So let's go through each fermion:

- Electron: 0.0005 GeV → allowed (since 0.0005 < 3)
- Muon: 0.1 GeV → allowed
- Tau: 1.78 GeV → allowed
- Up quark: ~0.003 GeV → allowed
- Down quark: same as up, allowed
- Strange quark: ~0.1 GeV (I think it's about 100 MeV, so 0.1 GeV) → allowed
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV → allowed
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV → wait, 4.5 is greater than 3, so not allowed. So X can't decay into b quarks because each would require more than 3 GeV each (since bottom is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. Wait, wait, no. Because the mass of X is 6 GeV, so each fermion pair has to have a combined mass up to 6 GeV. For each pair, each particle must have mass less than (6 GeV)/2 = 3 GeV. So for the b quark (mass ~4.5 GeV), each b would need 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So can't decay into b bbar.

So the allowed fermions are those with m < 3 GeV. So let's see:

Electron (e+ e-): allowed
Muon (mu+ mu-): allowed
Tau (tau+ tau-): allowed
Up, Down, Strange, Charm quarks.

Wait, but wait! The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, so each would require 1.5 GeV, which is under 3. So
