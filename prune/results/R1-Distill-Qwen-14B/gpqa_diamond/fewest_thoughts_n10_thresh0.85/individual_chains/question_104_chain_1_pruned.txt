Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The method used is radial velocity (RV), which measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

So, the RV method detects the star's movement towards and away from us. The shift in the spectral lines corresponds to the velocity of the star. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think. Or maybe it's the other way around? Wait, no, the velocity is related to the mass and the orbit. Let me think.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)))

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for the Doppler shift. Oh right, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I remember is:

K = ( (2πG) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But wait, since both planets have similar masses and the stars have the same mass, and the orbits are circular (so e=0), the equation should simplify. Because when e=0, the (1-e²) terms drop out.

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / T^(1/3) )

Wait, no. Let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (T) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (c
