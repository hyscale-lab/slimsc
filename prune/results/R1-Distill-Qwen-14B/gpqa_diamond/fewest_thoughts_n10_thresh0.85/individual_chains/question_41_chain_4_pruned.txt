Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. So, the setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities in different frames, especially involving light, I should probably use special relativity principles. Oh wait, but this is about the speed of light in the glass, which is a medium. So normally, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the vacuum speed of light. But here, the glass is moving, so I think it's a case of relative velocity.

But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. Oh, and the beam is moving towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards them, along the same direction as the light.

Wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So for the lab frame, the glass is moving towards them, and the light inside the glass is moving towards them as well, but within the glass.

But I'm a bit confused. Let's think about this step by step.

In the rest frame of the
