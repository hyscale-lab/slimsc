Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to handle these infinities so that you can renormalize the theory, making physical predictions finite and manageable.

So, when a theory requires regularization, it often means it has these divergences that need to be tamed. But some theories might not have such issues, or perhaps they don't need regularization because they're already free from divergences.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, and it's a candidate for a theory that unifies all forces. But wait, doesn't string theory have its own issues with divergences? Or maybe it's a theory that doesn't require the same kind of regularization because it's a different framework. Or perhaps it's because string theories are background-dependent and require different methods, but I'm not sure if they need regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, making perturbative methods applicable. But wait, does that mean it requires regularization? I think all quantum field theories might need regularization to handle loop divergences, but maybe QCD is non-perturbatively manageable because of confinement, but I'm not sure if regularization is needed for it.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established theory and is known to be renormalizable. So QED definitely requires regularization because it has divergences that need to be handled during renormalization. So it's not the answer because the question is looking for a theory that doesn't need regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version, right? So it doesn't involve the quantum aspects where divergences occur. In classical E&M, you don't deal with things like infinities in the same way because it's a classical theory. For example, point charges have issues with self-energy, but in the classical framework, maybe these aren't handled the same way as in quantum theories. So classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same quantum divergences.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. Does that affect anything? High energies in classical theories might not be an issue because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So classical
