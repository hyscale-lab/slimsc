Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power, or 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I need to figure out the relationship between the number of stars and the distance. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance (d) is 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So the number of stars, let's say N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in should help. Let's see: plx = 1/d, so 1/plx is d. Wait, so 1/(plx^5) is (d)^5. Because plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5. Taking the reciprocal, 1/(plx^5) becomes d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, that's the differential. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N with respect to d (dN/dd) would be proportional to 5d^4. But that's the rate of change. But the question asks how the number changes with distance, per unit of distance. Hmm, maybe they're looking for the relation between N and d, not the derivative.

Wait no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, so perhaps the differential. Because the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr would be N = k * (4πd² dr) * some factor, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, wait, the initial statement is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when parallax decreases (distance increases), the number of stars increases as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is same as N ∝ d^5. But wait, in reality, the number of stars expected to be in a given volume depends on the volume, which is proportional to d^2 dr for a spherical shell. But this question is a bit abstract, perhaps they're directly considering how N scales
