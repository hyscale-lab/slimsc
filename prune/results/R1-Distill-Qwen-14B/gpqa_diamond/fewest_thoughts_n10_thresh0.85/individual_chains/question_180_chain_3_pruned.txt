Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in a system of charges. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. But wait, since they're identical particles, I need to consider how their charges interact with each other.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where one charge is, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P. But wait, does that mean each of the 12 is 2 meters away from P, or are they all 2 meters apart from each other? Hmm, I think it's the former because it says each is at 2 m from P. So the 12 charges are all located 2 meters away from point P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, but how are these 12 arranged? Are they equally spaced on a sphere? Like a regular dodecagon on a sphere? Or does their arrangement not matter? Because for potential energy, I think only the distances between the charges matter. But in this case, since all 12 are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances might vary. Oh wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system. So maybe we're only considering the potential energy between the charges at P and the others, not the energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Because the 12 charges would be interacting with each other as well. Oh wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system, which would imply we're considering all interactions. Hmm, but maybe the problem simplifies it, perhaps only considering the interaction between the fixed charge and the others. Let me read the question again.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. So maybe the 12 charges are free to move except for being constrained at 2 meters from P. Oh wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 others are each at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other might vary. But since the problem says they're constrained, perhaps their positions can't change, so their mutual distances are fixed. Or maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, not between the 12 others.

Wait, but if all 12 charges are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P, then the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 and the 13th, plus the potential energies between all pairs of the 12. But considering that the 12 are fixed, perhaps their mutual distances are fixed as well. Hmm, but the problem says "the minimum energy of this system". So maybe the system's potential energy is the sum of all interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge at P and the other 12. That would make things easier. But I'm not sure. Let's think again.

The problem states that 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. The 13th is fixed
