Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The state vector is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I should probably normalize this state because probabilities require it. Also, the operator in question has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, such a matrix is usually a spin or Pauli matrix. Wait, the Pauli X matrix has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal. But here, the elements are hbar/2 when i≠j. So is this operator related to the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2?

Let me think. The Pauli X matrix, σ_x, is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if each element is multiplied by hbar/2, the operator A would be [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says Aij is hbar/2 when i≠j. So the diagonal elements would be zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So yes, A is proportional to σ_x.

Now, the task is to find the probability of measuring the eigenstates of operator A. Oh wait, operator A's eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_x multiplied by some factor. Because eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of σ_x, but the eigenvalues would be ± (hbar/2).

Wait, but when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the eigenstates in the given state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenstates of A and express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates to find the probabilities.

But wait, maybe I should consider that operator A is in the basis of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of σ_z. So perhaps the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are |+> and |->, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So first, I need to write |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->. Then the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, I can diagonalize A to find its eigenstates, but I think that's more work. Let's think about the eigenstates of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Or wait, is it the other way around? Let me recall. The eigenstates of σ_x for eigenvalue +1 are (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2), so in our notation, |up> and |down> correspond to spin up and down along z. So for σ_x, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), perhaps.

Wait no, wait. σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. The eigenstate for +1 is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and for -1 is (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2) as well. So yes, that's correct.

So, any state can be expressed in terms of these |+x> and |−x> states. Once I express |alpha> in this basis, the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients.

But wait, let me get back. Our state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization first.

The state is (1+i) |up> + (2 - i) |down>. The norm is the inner product of this with itself.

So the inner product is (1+i)(1-i)* |up><up| + (2 - i)(2 + i)* |down><down| + cross terms.

Wait, but since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their cross terms are zero. So the norm is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Compute |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm is 2 +5 =7
