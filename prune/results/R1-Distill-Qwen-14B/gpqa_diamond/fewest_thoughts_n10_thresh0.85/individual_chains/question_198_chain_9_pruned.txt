Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

We've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes (which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 or maybe another complex) among all cobalt species.

Wait, the question says "dithiocyanato," which usually refers to two SCN- ligands. But the complexes could be different. Let's think about the possible complexes. The stability constants are given for complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands, right?

The stability constants are in order β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because β4 is lower than β3. Hmm, so the order of stability is β3>β2>β1, and β4 is the least except for β1. Wait, no, β4 is 16, which is higher than β1 (9) but lower than β2 (40) and β3 (63). So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ligands (β3=63), followed by β2=40, then β4=16, and β1=9. Wait, no, because β4 is for the four-ligand complex. Hmm, maybe I should list them:

β1: [Co(SCN)]+ → β1=9
β2: [Co(SCN)2] → β2=40
β3: [Co(SCN)3]^- → β3=63
β4: [Co(SCN)4]^3- → β4=16

Wait, that can't be right because β4 is lower than β3. So the most stable is β3, then β2, then β4, then β1. Hmm, but that would mean that the [Co(SCN)3]^- is more stable than the [Co(SCN)2], which is more stable than [Co(SCN)4]^3-? But that seems odd. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the stability constants.

Wait, stability constants (formation constants) are given in order for the complexes. So for each n, βn is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge). Let me think: for Co(II), the charge is +2. Each SCN- is -1, so [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) because Co is +2 and each SCN is -1. So for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ (charge +1), β1=9. For n=2: [Co(SCN)_2], neutral, β2=40. n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- (charge -1), β3=63. n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^3- (charge -2?), β4=16. So the complexes are:

1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9
2: [Co(SCN)_2] → β2=40
3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63
4: [Co(SCN)_4]^3- → β4=16

Wait, so the β values are in the order β3>β2>β4>β1. Hmm, but that's a bit unexpected because β4 is lower than β2 and β3. So the order of stability is: β3 (
