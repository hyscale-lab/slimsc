Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, but often approximated as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ. 

So, the uncertainty in energy depends on the lifetime of the state because the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be measured because there's more time to observe it, leading to a smaller uncertainty. Alternatively, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

The question is asking for the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two states. So, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the measurements might not distinguish them clearly.

Wait, but wait. Each state has its own uncertainty. So for E1, which has a lifetime of 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 would be roughly ħ divided by the lifetime. Similarly for E2, ΔE2 would be ħ divided by 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but hang on. The energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps each of them needs to have the difference larger than their own uncertainty. Or maybe, the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The Heisenberg principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 is ħ/(1e-9). For E2, ΔE2 is ħ/(1e-8). Oh, wait, because Δt is the lifetime, which is inversely related to ΔE. So E2 has a longer lifetime, which means a smaller uncertainty in energy. Because the longer you can measure, the more precise the energy measurement.

So, the uncertainty for E1 is larger than for E2. So for the two energies E1 and E2 to be clearly distinguishable, the difference between E2 and E1 (let's say ΔE = E2 - E1) must be greater than the uncertainty in each. But wait, no. Because each state has its own uncertainty. So the minimal detectable ΔE should be the sum of the two uncertainties? Or maybe the maximum of the two?

Wait, I think I need to model this. Let's say E1 has a width (uncertainty) ΔE1, and E2 has a width ΔE2. To resolve them, their energy levels must be spaced so that the separation is greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Or perhaps the maximum of the two? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait another thought: when you have two peaks in an energy spectrum, the separation between the peaks must be larger than the sum of the half-widths (which are the uncertainties) to be distinguishable. Because each peak has its own uncertainty, so the minimal separation is when the peaks just touch. So the separation should be greater than the sum of the half-widths. But wait, maybe each half-width is the uncertainty divided by two? Or is it the full width?

Ah, I think the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is often used for line widths. The FWHM is related to the uncertainty by a factor. But for simplicity, maybe the question is assuming that ΔE is approximately the uncertainty.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the natural line width formula. The natural linewidth is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime. So the energy uncertainty is about ħ divided by the lifetime.

So, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or is it the maximum uncertainty?

Wait, maybe I should compute the uncertainties for each. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Given that ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But the options are in eV. So I should convert ħ to eV·s.

1 eV = 1.60217663e-19 joules.

So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.60217663e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.58e-16 / (1e-9) ) eV = 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = 6.58e-16 / (1e-8) ) = 6.58e-8 eV.

So the uncertainty for E1 is 6.58e-7 eV, and for E2 it's 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, that's a big difference. So, for the two levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the larger uncertainty, the two levels might not be resolvable.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Let me think.

Suppose we have two lines, each with their own widths. The minimal separation for them to be distinguishable is when their lines just barely don't overlap. So typically, the separation should be at least the sum of the half-widths. Oh wait, but the half-width is the standard deviation, which is about 0.5 times the FWHM. Hmm, but perhaps for this problem, we're being told that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of each, but perhaps it's better to take the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, let me think: if E1 has a ΔE1 of 6.58e-7 eV and E2 has ΔE2 of 6.58e-8 eV, which is about 1/10th of ΔE1. So the dominant uncertainty is from E1. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than ΔE1 to be distinguishable.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the two states are separate. Let me think again. The energy difference between the two states (ΔE) must be larger than the uncertainty in each state's energy. Or perhaps the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties from each state. So, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

In this case, ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. Adding those gives approximately 7.24e-7 eV. So ΔE must be greater than about 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is smaller than 7e-7 → too small.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → much larger than 7e-7 → yes, it's bigger.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → about 10 times smaller than 7e-7 → so no.

So only option C is bigger than 7.24e-7 eV. So the correct answer would be option C: 1e-4 eV.

Wait a second, but another thought: the energy difference required to be resolved isn't necessarily the sum of the uncertainties. Maybe the energy difference just needs to be larger than each individual uncertainty. Because if the energy difference is bigger than each of the uncertainties, then the separation would be clearly visible.

In that case, let's calculate each ΔE:

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV; ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV.

So, the energy difference must be larger than both. So, it just needs to be larger than the larger of the two. The larger is ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be >6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV (which is 0.0001 eV) → 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4 = 10000e-8, which is way larger than 6.58e-7. So that's fine.

Option D is 1e-8 eV → that's smaller than 6.58e-7, since 1e-8 is 1e-8, and 6.58e-7 is 658e-8. So 1e-8 is way smaller.

So in that case, the minimal energy difference required is about 6.58e-7 eV. So any option larger than that would be acceptable. So the options are:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-8 → too small.

B) 1e-11 → 0.00001e-9 → way too small.

C) 1e-4 → 100,000e-8 → way bigger than 658e-8 → acceptable.

D) 1e-8 → 10e-9 → smaller than 658e-8 → not acceptable.

So option C is the only one that's bigger than the required 6.58e-7 eV.

But wait, maybe I confused the approach. Because the question says the two states have a lifetime of 1e-9 and 1e-8. So, the uncertainty for each is ħ/tau. So, for E1, the uncertainty is about 6.5e-7 eV, and for E2, it's 6.5e-8 eV.

If the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, then the two states can be distinguished. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than each individual uncertainty. Which is more appropriate?

Wait, let's think about two energy levels. Each has its own width. If the spacing between the levels is much larger than the widths, then they are clearly distinguishable. So, the minimal spacing for them to be resolved is when the spacing is equal to the sum of their half-widths. Or perhaps, just the larger of the two half-widths.

Alternatively, considering that if the energy difference is smaller than the maximum uncertainty, they might not be distinguishable. But if it's larger than both, then they are clearly separated.

Wait, perhaps another way. Imagine each state has a Gaussian-shaped energy distribution. The standard deviation for each is their uncertainty. The separation between the means (E2 - E1) must be at least the sum of the standard deviations for the peaks to be resolvable. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the peaks would overlap.

So in that case, the energy difference should be greater than the sum: ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Which, as I calculated earlier, is approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 7e-7 eV. Let's check the options again.

Looking at option C: 1e-4 eV is 1e-4. Which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 ≈ 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Let me compute 7e-7 eV in terms of exponentials. 7e-7 is 0.0000007 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 0.0000007 eV. So it's way more than required.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4. That would more than satisfy the condition of ΔE >7e-7.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). The lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Calculating the uncertainties for each state:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference (\( \Delta E \)) between \( E_2 \) and \( E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \). Adding these uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy difference must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than Option A. Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
