Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with dibromides, it might cause an elimination reaction. Wait, wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dibromide because the bromines are on adjacent carbons. So, when you heat it with KOH, it probably undergoes elimination to form an alkene. That makes sense because elimination reactions typically form alkenes, and the product would be a diene maybe? Or perhaps just an alkene here.

The product 1 is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination usually gives alkenes, which don't have carbonyls. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong here. Oh, wait, could it be a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else? Or maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, no substitution here, because KOH is a base. 

Wait another thought—maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement. Oh, wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, perhaps when KOH is added, both bromides leave as Br- and the two carbons form a double bond. So it would form 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe the product is an enol? No, wait, elimination would form a double bond. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone instead. How?

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting the reaction wrong. Oh, no, wait. Another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH in an E2 mechanism, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr to form a double bond. But since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, the elimination of two HBr molecules would lead to an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds) or perhaps a more substituted double bond. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the structure. Adamantane is like a diamond structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons of the adamantane framework. When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent H's are abstracted, leading to a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-diene? Or maybe it's getting dehydrohalogenated to form an alkene. But then, how do we get a carbonyl group?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions. Another possibility: maybe it's not elimination but substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, not a nucleophile in substitution. Unless it's an SN2, but with vicinal dihalides, perhaps a double substitution could occur, but that would form a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's not matching.

Wait, another thing: maybe the reaction is a Dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then maybe another reaction. Or perhaps the KOH is acting as a base for elimination, but the product is a ketone. That doesn't make sense because elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, looking at the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet or maybe a doublet. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H), which suggests some equivalent protons maybe in a ring. Then 1.94 (2H). Wait, but wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a ketone group. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane produce a ketone when heated with KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's an intramolecular elimination. Let me think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on C1 and C3. Heating with KOH would cause the Brs to leave, and the adjacent Hs to be abstracted, leading to a double bond between C1 and C3. But wait, that would form an allene (a conjugated diene), but that doesn't explain a ketone.

Oh wait a minute, maybe the reaction is a Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution. Wait, but that's more common with aromatic systems, like in the synthesis of phenols from nitro compounds using H2O and a catalyst. Not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amides, which we don't have here.

Hmm. Maybe the product is not an alkene but a diketone. But how? Oh wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a cleavage reaction. Wait, if KOH cleaves the C-Br bonds, but how? Maybe if each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would be diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and if it's opened, perhaps leading to a more open structure with carbonyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not carbonyl groups.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters and forms rings. Not sure that's applicable
