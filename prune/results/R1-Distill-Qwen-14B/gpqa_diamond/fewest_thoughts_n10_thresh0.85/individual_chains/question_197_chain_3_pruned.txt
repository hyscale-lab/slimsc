Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about a compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the product is from the given IR and NMR data. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since the other options don't have nitrogen, it's likely an O-H stretch. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks might be aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, maybe the compound has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an acid, and an aromatic ring.

Next, the NMR data. The peaks are at:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which often corresponds to an aldehyde proton, but also could be an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid would typically be around 10-12 ppm and a singlet. Alternatively, an aldehyde is usually around 9-10, but the broadness suggests exchange, like in an -OH group. Hmm, maybe it's a phenolic OH, but if it's a strong acid, like a carboxylic acid, that might fit too.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. So maybe two groups on opposite positions of the ring.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group or in a cyclic structure. Maybe a secondary alcohol or an adjacent CH to a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl or another group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet with 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. Like a CH(CH3)₂ perhaps, or a methyl adjacent to a CH that's part of a branch.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet at the end of a chain, probably a methyl group attached to a CH₂ that's near another group.

Let me try to piece this together. The aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene. So groups are in the para positions. Looking at the substituents, the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe one of the substituents is a carbonyl group.

One substituent is something with a carbonyl. The 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid, but then the 1720 cm⁻¹ would make sense as a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Wait, if it's a ketone, the O-H wouldn't be present. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, in the IR, O-H would have a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which matches a carboxylic acid's O-H. But wait, sometimes, if the acid is deprotonated, but that's probably not the case here.

So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent in the para position. Oh, but wait, the NMR doesn't have a triplet for a CH₂ next to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, another thought: The IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is a strong, probably ester or ketone or carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be around 2500-3000, which the IR shows. So maybe that's a possibility.

Looking at the NMR again, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be a CH next to a carbonyl. Let's think about a structure where a benzene ring is attached to a chain that includes a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone, like a propionyl group. Hmm, but the IR doesn't show strong O-H, so perhaps it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) which is typical of a CH₂CH₂CH3 group, like an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl next to a CH group. So maybe we have a substituent like CH₂-C(O)-something.

Let me try to think of substituents. So, the substituents on the benzene are one group that's a carbonyl-containing group and another that's an ethyl or similar.

Putting this together, perhaps the compound is a benzene with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a branching, perhaps a propyl group attached.

Wait, another approach: the NMR has two sets of aromatic protons. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) suggests electron-withdrawing groups. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl (like a ketone or acid) and the other is an alkyl group.

The substituents are in para positions. So, structure could be:

Phenyl ring with a carbonyl group (like CO-) and an isobutyl group, perhaps.

Wait, looking at the substituents, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a CH(CH3) group. So maybe the substituent is a CH₂CH(CH3) group attached to
