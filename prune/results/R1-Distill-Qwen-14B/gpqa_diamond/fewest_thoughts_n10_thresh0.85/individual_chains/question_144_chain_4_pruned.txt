Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me a meson X with production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the decay length is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula, I think, is something like decay distance L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But how do I get τ from the given parameters?

Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty and Δt is the time uncertainty. For a particle, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy (Γ = ΔE), and the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait. I also recall that there's a relativistic thing to consider for the velocity. Because the particle's lifetime is in its rest frame, but the decay length depends on the speed at which it's moving. So the distance is v multiplied by the lifetime multiplied by the speed. Or wait, actually, the time experienced in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the particle's velocity v can be found from its energy and mass. But wait, the production energy E_X is the total energy, right? So E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). Then, the velocity beta is v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Oh wait, but maybe it's easier to use the relation between energy, mass, and velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the particle's velocity using relativistic equations. Let's think. The energy E is given as 8 GeV
