Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. 

The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as ħ/2 multiplied by specific 2x2 matrices. The question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. The options provided are A, B, C, D.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for a particle's momentum along a direction n is given by the dot product of the vector of momentum operators (like P_x, P_y, P_z) and the direction vector n. So the operator P along n would be P · n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Wait, the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane. So that means the y-component of n is zero, right? Because any vector in the x-z plane has n_y = 0. So, n can be written as (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² = 1 since it's a unit vector.

So the operator P along n is P_x n_x + P_z n_z. Because n_y is zero, the P_y term doesn't contribute.

Let me write down each component matrix:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, when we take P · n, it's (P_x n_x + P_z n_z) multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no. Because each component already includes the ħ/2 factor. So P_x is (ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]], so when we compute P·n, it's n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because P_y term is zero.

So operator P can be written as:

P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
= (ħ/2) [n_x [ [0,1;1,0] ] + n_z [ [1,0;0,-1] ]

Let me compute this matrix. Combining the terms:

The (1,1) element is (n_z)(1) + (n_x)(0) = n_z.
The (1,2) element is (n_x)(1) + (n_z)(0) = n_x.
Similarly, the (2,1) element is n_x.
The (2,2) element is (n_z)(-1) = -n_z.

So the matrix P becomes:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

But wait, actually, each P_x and P_z already have the ħ/2 factor. So when we add them, we can factor out ħ/2.

So P = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
                [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, no. Let me clarify. P_x is (ħ/2) times that matrix, and P_z is (ħ/2) times that matrix. So adding them gives:

n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which equals (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

So the matrix representation of P is that. Now, since the operator P has eigenvalue +ħ/2, we're looking for the eigenvector |ψ> such that P|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Wait, that's the eigenvalue equation. So:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

But since P is (ħ/2) times the matrix we wrote, substituting that in:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2), we get:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives the system of equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me rearrange the first equation:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b.

Similarly, second equation:

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = [ (n_z +1) / n_x ] b.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to write the matrix equation as (M - I) v = 0, where M is the matrix and I is the identity matrix. So let's compute M - I:

M - I = [ [n_z -1, n_x],
          [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So determinant is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 = 0.

Expanding: (n_z^
