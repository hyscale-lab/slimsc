Okay, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The question gives four options, and I have to choose which combination is correct. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I remember that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Operators in the SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz symmetric, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from it. So symmetry 1 is definitely required.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Operators in SMEFT are built in a way that they transform covariantly under the Poincare group. Wait, but wait. SMEFT is a effective theory that often includes higher-dimension operators. But I think that the operators are local, so they should respect Poincare symmetry. Because if they didn't, you might have non-local terms, which are not part of the usual SMEFT setup. So symmetry 2, Poincare, must also be respected.

Third, CP symmetry. Hmm. I'm not so sure about this. The Standard Model itself doesn't respect CP symmetry in general; for example, the CKM matrix in QCD leads to CP violation. So, can the SMEFT operators violate CP? I think yes. SMEFT can include operators that break CP. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Oh, but wait, the operators in the SMEFT are constructed in such a way that their coefficients can be complex, which would allow CP violation. So, the operators themselves don't have to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, symmetry 3, CP, is not a must. So not all operators respect CP.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. I know that in quantum field theories, CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement because it's tied to the unitarity of the theory. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and so does SMEFT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. That means symmetry 4 is required.

Putting it together: which symmetries must be respected by all operators? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if Poincare is respected, Lorentz is automatically respected. So the question is whether both 1 and 2
