Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

We have acetic acid being diluted with water, and then titrated with NaOH. I'm supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values and choose the correct pair.

First, let's break down the problem. Acetic acid is a weak acid, CH3COOH, and NaOH is a strong base. When titrated, they react to form the acetate ion, CH3COO^-.

The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the volume doubles, which will affect the concentration.

Wait, right. When you dilute a solution, the concentration changes with the dilution factor. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles/volume. Moles are same, so 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate that. 0.02 L * 0.05 M is 0.001 mol. Volume is 40 mL, which is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH needed: same, since it's 1:1. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / conc. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question isn't asking about the equivalence point volume directly, but about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So for 25% titration: 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of
