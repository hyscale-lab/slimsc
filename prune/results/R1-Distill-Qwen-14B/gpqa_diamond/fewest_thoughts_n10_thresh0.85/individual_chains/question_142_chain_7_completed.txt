Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, let me try to remember what I know about density matrices. I think a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For pure states, the density matrix is a projection operator, but for mixed states, it's a statistical mixture.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because each of the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ is equally weighted with probability 1/2. So this state has equal probability in both states, right?

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit hazy on how exactly density matrices correspond to points in space. I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, often using the Bloch sphere representation. But wait, Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? How does that work for mixed states?

Oh, right. For mixed states, the density matrix is a point in the space of all possible density matrices, which might be a higher-dimensional space. But the options given are 3-dimensional vectors, so maybe the problem is using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Bloch vector representation, which is a way to visualize the state on a sphere.

Wait, I think the Bloch vector for a mixed state is either the same as a pure state or perhaps scaled somehow. But wait, in the case of a maximally mixed state, I think the Bloch vector would be at the origin because it's an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Let me think about the Bloch sphere more carefully.

In the Bloch sphere representation, a pure state |ψ⟩ is represented as a vector (x, y, z), where x = ⟨x|ψ⟩, etc., and the state is on the surface of a unit sphere. For mixed states, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find r. Let's compute.

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute this. Each of |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are diagonal matrices. |0⟩ is [1,0], so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait a minute, so ρ = (I + 0·σ)/2. Because I is equal to (I +0*σ_x + 0*σ_y + 0*σ_z)/2? No, wait, because (I + r·σ)/2 would expand to (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

But in our case, ρ is (I)/2. So that implies that r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. Oh, so the density matrix is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer must be C.

Wait, but let me just confirm. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as:

ρ = (1 + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

Wait, no, wait. The correct expression is:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

But wait, no, because when you have a pure state |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩, then the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). So when the state is maximally mixed, like (I)/2, that would correspond to r being zero because the state is a uniform mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, so there's no preferred direction in the x, y, or z axes. So the Bloch vector is zero, which would place it at the origin.

Alternatively, if I compute ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, and set it equal to (I)/2, then r must be zero. Because:

(I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 + (r·σ)/2.

So for ρ to be I/2, r must be zero.

So yeah, the correct geometric position is r=(0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is an equal statistical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch vector representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can generally be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the term \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) must vanish, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Thus, the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere representation.

From the options provided:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state with a specific Bloch vector.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a different mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** Correct, as this matches the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state with a specific Bloch vector.

Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
