Okay, let's tackle this problem. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. So, the question is about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, let's outline the information given:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**: Shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740-1760 cm⁻¹. So, the compound must have an ester group.

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - Six signals in total.
   - Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern will determine the number of unique aromatic protons. Di-substituted rings can have either ortho, meta, or para substitution. For para, there are two sets of equivalent protons, each giving a singlet or a doublet. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the substituents are para, the ring has two sets of equivalent Hs. For example, in para-substituted benzene, you might have two doublets because of coupling, but wait, no, in ortho, meta, or para substitution, the splitting varies. Wait, but wait, the structure could be such that the substituents cause each aromatic H to be unique, but perhaps in this case, maybe it's a substituent that causes two sets of Hs. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent that leads to two different types of Hs. Hmm, maybe the ring is part of a larger structure, like being attached to an ester group.

   - Two signals correspond to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, so maybe there's an alkene group attached to the benzene ring. The coupling patterns can tell us about the structure around them. A doublet suggests each H is coupled to one other H. A doublet of quartets suggests that each H is coupled to two different sets of Hs? Or perhaps it's a more complex splitting. Maybe it's part of a substituent like an ester group with a vinyl group attached.

   - Two signals for -CH3 groups. So, there are two different methyl groups in the structure. Since they give two separate signals, these methyl groups are not equivalent. So, probably attached to different parts of the molecule.

   - No signals for -CH2 groups. So, the molecule doesn't have any methylene (-CH2-) groups. That suggests that any aliphatic chains are either single CH3 groups or perhaps other substituents without CH2.

So, putting this together, the compound has an aromatic ring with two substituents. One of them is an ester group, perhaps. So the substituents might be an ester group and another group that has vinyl and methyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the ester group. The ester functional group is R-O-CO-R'. So, maybe the aromatic ring is attached to an ester, like a benzyl ester or something else.

But wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so perhaps each substituent is an ester group? No, wait, the ester group is a substituent that includes an oxygen. But the question says it's a di-substituted ring, so two substituents on the benzene ring.

Hmm, another possibility: maybe one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R or something), and the other substituent is a vinyl group with methyl substituents. Wait, that might complicate things. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a group that itself has a vinyl and methyl group, like maybe an allyl group or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester (like an acetyl group) and another group that has both vinyl and methyl protons. For example, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (-O
