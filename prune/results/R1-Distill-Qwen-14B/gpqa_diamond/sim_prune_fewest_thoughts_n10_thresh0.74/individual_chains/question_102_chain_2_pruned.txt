Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the mice after the experiment. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

First, the setup: They have a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. That means the vector has two genes, ligand and receptor, under different promoters or something. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. There are stop cassettes with different lox sites between them.

Wait, so the vector probably has the ligand ORF followed by a stop with loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF with another stop using lox2272. Because when Cre is present, it will recombine the lox sites and remove the stop cassettes, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed.

But in this case, they used SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think. So when you breed the mice that are homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes in the neural crest cells. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed in those cells.

The problem is that after using the Cre, they don't see the green signal, which is from the receptor-eGFP fusion. So why isn't eGFP showing up?

Looking at the options:

Option A says the ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, not autocrine. But I'm not sure how that affects the expression of the fluorescent markers. Maybe if the ligand is secreted, it's not in the same cell as the receptor, but I'm not sure how that affects the Western blot or the GFP expression. The question is about the expression in the construct itself, not the function of the ligand-receptor pair.

Option B suggests the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the receptor is a transmembrane protein, it would be processed through the Golgi. However, if it's stuck, maybe it doesn't get to the cell surface, so we wouldn't see the GFP. But the problem is in the mice after breeding, so they'd be looking at the expression in the offspring's cells. Also, the Western blot didn't show the expected bands? Or did it? Wait, the user says after plasmid transfection, the Western blot was done, but the mice were then crossed and looked at under confocal. So maybe the Western blot is a separate check, but in the mice, the issue is elsewhere.

Option C is about missing enhancer. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think, so perhaps if the enhancer is missing, the ligand isn't expressed. But the problem is with the receptor-eGFP. The receptor is under an IRES element, which is a weaker promoter perhaps, but IRES is often used to drive expression in the same mRNA as another gene. Wait, in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, then stop, then IRES, then receptor. So the receptor is under the same CBA promoter, but after an IRES. Wait, no, IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, meaning that it allows for the translation of the second gene without the need for the ribosome to terminate. So the same mRNA would have the ligand and receptor, with the IRES allowing the receptor to be translated. But in this case, the stop cassettes are in between.

Wait, the vector is ligand (CBA promoter), then a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then IRES, then receptor, then stop (lox2272-stop-lox2272). So without Cre, the ligand is expressed
