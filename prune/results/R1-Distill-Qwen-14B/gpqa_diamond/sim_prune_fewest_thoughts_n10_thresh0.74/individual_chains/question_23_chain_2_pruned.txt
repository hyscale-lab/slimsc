Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound in the experiment is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmm, I need to visualize that structure. So the benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached. The other part of the ether is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me draw that. But-3-en-1-yl would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 3, right? So structure-wise, it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? Wait, maybe I should number it properly. But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Oh wait, that can't be right because but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be: the main chain is four carbons, double bond starts at 3, so positions 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but wait, that doesn't make sense because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 but I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with substituents. Oh wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the but-3-en-1-yl group would be:

Position 1: the oxygen is attached here. So position 1 is CH2- attached to O. Then position 2 is CH(CH3)2 because it's 2,2-dimethyl. Wait, no. Let me think. But-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the substituents are on C2, right? Because it's 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure would be
