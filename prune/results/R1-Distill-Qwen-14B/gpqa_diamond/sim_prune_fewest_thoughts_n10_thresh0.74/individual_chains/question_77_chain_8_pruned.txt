Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my Cope, but let me think through this.

The question has two parts, each involving a reaction leading to product A and B. I need to figure out which option correctly identifies both products.

First, let's look at the first reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, right? It's typically used for deprotonation. But wait, in some cases, like in the Cope rearrangement, maybe it's used to deprotonate to form a more reactive species. Oh, wait, no, the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. So maybe the starting material isn't a 1,5-diene yet. Let me draw the structure.

So the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Let me parse that. So, the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3). Wait, no, but the butenyl group is but-2-en-1-yl. So the chain is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, butenyl starts from the first carbon, so but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- attached via the first carbon. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, structure of (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. So the group attached is OCH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- with the double bond starting at C2.
