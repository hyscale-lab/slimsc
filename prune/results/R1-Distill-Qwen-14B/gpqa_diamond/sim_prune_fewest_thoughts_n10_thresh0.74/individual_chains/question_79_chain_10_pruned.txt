Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound X based on the NMR data of its product after a reaction. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. Compound X is C₁₁H₁₂O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and we need to find out what Compound X is from the options A to D.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh, right, that's a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Or wait, actually, I think it's used in some kind of ring-opening reactions. Oh, or maybe it's a base used in certain eliminations. Wait, no, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalyst or part of a reaction mechanism. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. The solvent is nonpolar, and temperature is 403 K, which is around 130°C. That's quite hot, so maybe a Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe some kind of elimination.

But wait, the product has NMR data. Let me look at that. The 1H NMR has signals at δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So that's six signals. Let's break them down.

The singlet at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups, perhaps adjacent to something deshielded, like maybe an oxygen? Or perhaps they're attached to carbons with different environments. Wait, but why two singlets? Maybe they are on different carbons, each with three Hs, and
