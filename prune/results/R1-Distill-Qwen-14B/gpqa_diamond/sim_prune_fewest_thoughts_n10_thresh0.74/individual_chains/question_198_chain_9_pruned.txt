Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the blue one? I think the blue complexes are the ones with two SCN- ligands. So I'm guessing that's the Co(SCN)_2²+ complex, which is the dithiocyanato complex. So the question is asking for the fraction of Co that's in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]²+ compared to all possible cobalt species.

So, stability constants are involved here. Stability constant (β) tells us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The general formula is β_n = [Co(SCN)_n²+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^n). So for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]²+, the concentration is given by β_n multiplied by [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: Co²+ plus each complex. So we need to calculate the concentration of each complex, then find out what fraction is the [Co(SCN)_2]²+.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Write expressions for each complex concentration in terms of [Co²+].
2. Sum all these concentrations to find the total [Co].
3. Solve for [Co²+] because total [Co] is equal to c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

Wait, but the problem says c(Co) is 1e-2 M. So that's the total cobalt, including all complexes and free Co²+.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial concentration of Co²+ is 1e-2 M? Or is it that the sum of all Co species is 1e-2 M? I think it's the latter because the problem says "total cobalt concentration" is 1e-2 M.

So, let me define the species:

- Co²+ (free)
- [Co(SCN)]+ (monosubstituted, n=1)
- [Co(SCN)_2]²+ (n=2, blue)
- [Co(SCN)_3]³+ (n=3)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4)

Wait, but wait—charge on the complexes. Let me think. Cobalt(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}, the charge is +2 -n.

So n=1: +1, n=2: 0, wait no, wait: n=1 would be Co(SCN)²+? Wait, wait no: wait, the complex would be [Co
