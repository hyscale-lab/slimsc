Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and going through several transformations to give a final product. Let's break down each step.

First, the first reaction: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitration is a common electrophilic substitution reaction. H2SO4 acts as a catalyst, and HNO3 is the nitric acid which provides the nitronium ion, NO2+. Benzene's highly activated ring undergoes this substitution. Since benzene is symmetric, the nitration should occur at the para position, but wait, benzene has only one substituent, so the product would have a nitro group in the para position? Or maybe ortho or meta? Wait no, for nitration of benzene, the major product is the nitro group entering the para position, but actually, wait, no. Benzene's nitration gives a mixture, but the major product is actually the ortho and para isomers, but since the ring is symmetric, it's a single product? Hmm, no. Wait, noâ€”benzene when nitrated gives mainly para-nitrobenzene, but actually, the initial product is a mix of ortho, meta, para, but since the starting material is benzene, which is symmetric, the nitration would give a mixture, but in reality, it's para and ortho. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene's nitration under typical conditions (like conc. HNO3 and H2SO4) tends to produce more para product because the meta is less favored due to steric hindrance. Or is it the other way around? I think I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration of benzene gives a meta director? No, nitro groups are meta directors. But wait, we're just adding the nitro group to benzene. Benzene is a symmetric molecule, so the nitro group can attach in any position, but when the first group is added, it can go para or ortho, but the major product is the para due to stability. So product 1 is nitrobenzene, but I'm not entirely sure about the position. Wait, nitro group is a strong meta director, but when
