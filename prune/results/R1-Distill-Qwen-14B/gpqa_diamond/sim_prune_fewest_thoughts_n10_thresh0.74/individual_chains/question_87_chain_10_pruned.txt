Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, I need to figure out what the structure looks like and then match it with the given NMR options.

Wait, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. So, two substituents on the ring. The total carbons are 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. But wait, each substituent could be a group that adds more carbons. Wait, hold on. Wait, no, the molecule has 8 carbons in total. So the benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents equals 8. So substituents contribute 2 carbons. But each substituent is attached to benzene, so maybe each substituent is a single carbon group? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is a single?

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about substituents. For example, if it's a para-substituted benzene, say with two substituents each attached to opposite positions on the ring. Each substituent could be a group like -OCH3, -Cl, etc. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent has a carbonyl (like maybe an ester, ketone, or aldehyde group), and the other is a halogen, like Cl or Br.

Wait, but the IR shows both a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen (like C-Cl or C-Br) stretch. So the substituents are a halide and a carbonyl group. But wait, halogens as substituents on benzene are common (like Cl, Br), but a carbonyl group in a substituent... So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, and another is a halogen.

Wait, but the substituents are attached to the benzene. So for example, maybe one substituent is a -COOR group, which is an ester, which has a carbonyl
