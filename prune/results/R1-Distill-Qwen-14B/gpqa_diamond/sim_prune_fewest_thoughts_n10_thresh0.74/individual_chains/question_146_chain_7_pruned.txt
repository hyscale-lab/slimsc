Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It says that 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride, and I need to find the major product. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my cycloaddition reactions, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile. Dienophiles are usually involved in Diels-Alder reactions. Oh right, the Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered cyclohexene derivative. So that's probably what's happening here.

The compound given is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Let me draw that out. So, the structure would have double bonds between C1-C2 and C3-C4, making it a conjugated diene in a ring. But wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have the double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions, so the ring would have two double bonds next to each other. Wait, no, that's not possible because in a five-membered ring, having 1,3-diene would mean double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, which are conjugated. Oh, but wait, cyclopentadiene is usually 1,3-cyclopentadiene. So in this case, the molecule is 5-fluoro, which implies a fluorine substituent at position 5. Let me number the ring: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 1 is the first carbon, then 2, etc. So the fluorine is on carbon 5, which is adjacent to the 4 position. Wait, but if the ring has double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, then the positions 4 and 5 are adjacent. So the fluorine is on the same side as position 4.

Wait, so when reacting with maleic anhydride, which is a good dienophile, the diene (cyclopentadiene) will act as the conjugated diene in the Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, the
