Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem says the interaction Lagrangian is given by L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between fields. So here, the boson X is interacting with fermions. The term (v + X(y)) suggests that v is the vacuum expectation value (VEV), which is usually around 246 GeV for the Higgs. Wait, but in this case, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, which is way less than the Higgs mass. Interesting.

The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have enough energy to be created. So I need to look at the possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into.

The mass of X is 6 GeV, so any decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because each fermion pair must have a rest mass less than half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV. Wait, no, because each particle in the pair must have a mass less than X's mass divided by 2. So for a pair like f and f̄, each must have a mass less than 3 GeV.

Wait, let me get that straight. The rest mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to m_X / 2. Because when a particle at rest decays, each product must have energy at least their rest mass. So for X → f f̄, each f must have a mass m_f ≤ m_X /2.

So m_X is 6 GeV, so m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Now, let's list the known fermion masses. The charged leptons: electrons are about 0.5 MeV, negligible. Muon is about 105.7 MeV. Tau is about 1.78 GeV. So tau has a mass under 3 GeV. Neutrinos are even lighter, but the question includes them? Wait, wait, the Lagrangian has ψ_f, which are presumably charged leptons and quarks because neutrinos are neutral. Wait, but in the interaction term, the fermions must be charged because X is neutral (since it's a boson field, probably a scalar). So the interaction is likely similar to the Higgs, which couples to charged fermions.

So, for each charged fermion, what's their mass?

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are about a few MeV. So definitely below 3 GeV.

Strange is about 100 MeV or so, but wait, no, I think strange is around 100 MeV. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: up and
