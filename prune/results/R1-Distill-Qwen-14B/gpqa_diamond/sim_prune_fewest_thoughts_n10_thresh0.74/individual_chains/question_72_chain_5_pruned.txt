Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a series of organic reactions, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Hmm, organic chemistry can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

First, let's look at the starting material. The first compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo structures are like norbornene derivatives. So, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornene structure, which is a bridged bicyclic compound. The 7-position has a tert-butoxy group. So tert-butoxy is a bulky substituent, which is O connected to a tert-butyl group.

Next, the first reaction: it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction scenario. Wait, sodium iodide is often a good nucleophile. But wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene... Let me think. The structure of this diene would have two cyclohexene rings? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene. Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, and at positions 5 and 6, each has a dibromomethyl group. So each of those positions has a CH2 group with two Br atoms? Wait, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2? No, wait, dibromomethyl would be Br2C-; but no, methyl is CH3, so dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2? Or is it CH2 with two Br substituents? Or maybe each CH2 has two Brs? Wait, no, maybe each substituent is a -CH2Br. Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) would be two CH2Br groups attached at positions 5 and 6 of the cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Wait, but the starting material is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So cyclohexa-1,3-diene has double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions. So, positions 5 and 6 are each attached to a CH2Br2? Or perhaps, each of the 5 and 6 positions have a CH2Br group. Wait, maybe each substituent is CH2Br. Because dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2, but that's not possible because a methyl group can't have two bromines attached if it's only CH2. Wait, no, wait, the substituent is -CH2Br, right? So, maybe 5 and 6 each have a CH2Br group. So each of those positions has a CH2Br. Hmm, but in the starting compound, it's 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so perhaps each of those is CH2Br2? But that can't be because a methyl
