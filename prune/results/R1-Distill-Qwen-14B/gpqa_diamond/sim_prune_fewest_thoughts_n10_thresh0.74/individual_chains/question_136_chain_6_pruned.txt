Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to tackle. Hmm, let's see. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and only has a radial component. 

Wait, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. So if I'm integrating the divergence over a volume, that should relate to something like the flux through the surface or maybe the sources inside the volume. Oh right, Gauss's Law! That connects the divergence of a vector field to the flux through a surface.

But wait, Gauss's Law in this context is ∇·E = rho/epsilon_0, but here I don't know if there's a charge involved. Oh wait, the problem isn't about electric fields, but the concept might be similar. The vector field here is f(r), which falls off as 1/r². The electric field of a point charge also does that, so maybe this is analogous.

Wait, in Gauss's Law, the integral of E·dA over a closed surface equals the enclosed charge. But that's E being the electric field. So if f(r) is similar to E, then maybe the integral of ∇·f over the volume would be the total "charge" or something similar. But in this problem, we're just told about the vector field, so perhaps the divergence itself gives the source term.

Let me think about the divergence in spherical coordinates since the field is radial. For a vector field that's purely radial and depends only on r, the divergence should be simpler. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component F_r is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r). 

So here, F_r is 1/r². Plugging that in: (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ). Simplify inside: r² * 1/r² is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence ∇·f is zero everywhere except maybe at r=0.

Wait, but wait a second. Because at r=0, the field isn't defined. So the divergence might be non-zero only at the origin. But when we integrate over the volume, including the origin, perhaps that's a point source. 

If the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral over any volume that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But if the volume does include the origin (as in this case, the sphere of radius R is centered at the origin), then the integral might not be zero. Because in that case, the divergence isn't a continuous function everywhere in the volume, but has a delta function at the origin.

Wait, so maybe the divergence of f(r) is zero except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So when you integrate ∇·f over the volume, you get the value of the divergence at the origin times the volume's contribution, but maybe that's not the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the divergence in more detail. Let's compute ∇·f. Since f(r) is purely radial and f(r) = 1/r², the vector field
