Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. We have a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and we need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I should probably look at the spectroscopic data provided to figure out what compound X is. Then, I can think about what reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. 

Starting with the IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1 suggests there's an alkyne or an alcohol, but wait, the high region is around 3400. Another possibility is an O-H stretch. The peaks at 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might indicate aromatic rings, possibly with some conjugation or substituents.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a pretty upfield shift, but wait, more accurately, 10.5 is a very high chemical shift. That could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, no. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, which is also around 10-12 ppm. But since it's a broad singlet (bs), it might be a carboxylic acid O-H. But wait, in NMR, carboxylic acids are usually broad around 10-12. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehydes are deshielded and appear as a singlet. But why is it broad? Maybe it's an acidic proton like in a phenol or an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, let's think again. The peak at 10.5 ppm is a singlet, broad. For a phenol, the O-H is usually around 5-7 ppm, so that might not fit. Wait, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl group? Or perhaps a ketone adjacent proton? No, those are usually lower. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but maybe this is a carboxylic acid. But in the NMR, the -OH of a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak, so that fits. So maybe compound X has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but I should look at the other signals. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are indicative of an aromatic ring with two substituents. Like a para-substituted benzene. For example, a para-substituted benzene would have two doublets in the aromatic region. So that's a benzene ring with two groups in the para positions. Then, what else?

The other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's break those down.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (t,
