Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I should figure out what the nucleus X is. Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Now, the problem relates to relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases, and the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. So I need to use the relativistic energy formulas.

The total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m_0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can compute gamma.

Let me plug in the numbers. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². Let's calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is... let me see, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. What's 1 divided by 0.28? Hmm, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me calculate more accurately. 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, but wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) so that's 1/0.28 which is 3.5714 approximately. But I should be precise here because the answer options are given to four decimal places. Let me use a calculator approach. Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2 = 0.0784. Square root is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Okay, so gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy for a Li-6 nucleus. What's the mass of Li-6? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact values, but I think the atomic mass of Li
