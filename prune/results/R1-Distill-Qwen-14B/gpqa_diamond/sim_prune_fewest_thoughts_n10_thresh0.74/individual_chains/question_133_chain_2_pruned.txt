Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I guess is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Orthophosphate ions are HPO4^3- or maybe PO4^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. The different forms are:

H3PO4 (triprotic) → can lose a proton stepwise:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So the species present in solution are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or maybe H3PO4 is called orthophosphoric acid, so the conjugate base would be H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-.

Wait, I think orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps orthophosphate refers to the H2PO4^- ion. Or wait, no, I think orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- form. Because when you have NaH2PO4, it's the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and Na2HPO4 is hydrogen phosphate. So maybe the ortho is HPO4^2-.

But wait, the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So I need to find [HPO4^2-] in the solution.

The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-; Na2HPO4 is Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So when these two salts dissolve, they contribute H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So the solution is a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. So the solution has both the dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4
