Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit so researchers should observe that one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on a few factors. The main idea is that the chance increases if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But how do we calculate that probability?

I think the formula for the transit probability is something like the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star to the planet, all squared. Wait, no, maybe it's the square of the star's radius divided by the cube of the orbital distance? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, that's the geometric probability, right? So P = (R*/a)^2 * (1/(1 - e²)^(3/2)), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), it simplifies to (R*/a)^2.

Wait, but wait, actually, the transit probability formula is (R_star / a)^2 times some other factors, but maybe in this question, since the planets are already detected via the RV method, the only thing we need to consider is (R_star / a)^2. Because the RV method gives the minimum mass and the orbital period (which relates to a via Kepler's third law).

So, the question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 /3.

Wait, Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) a³. Since the planets' masses are much smaller than the stars, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So P² ∝ a³/(M). So a³ = (G(M + m) P²)/(4π²), but since M is different for each star, let's think about each planet's semi-major axis.

Planet_1's host star has mass M1 = 2 * M2. Let me denote M2 as the mass of Planet_2's host star. So M1=2 M2.

For Planet_1: P1 = P2 /3.

Using Kepler's third law for each:

a1^3 = (G (M1) P1² )/(4π²)
a2^3 = (G (M2) P2² )/(4π²)

Divide a1^3 by a2^3:

(a1/a2)^3 = (M1 P1²) / (M2 P2²)
But M1=2 M2, P1 = P2/3. So substituting:

= (2 M2 * (P2² /9)) ) / (M2 P2² )
Simplify: (2/9) * P2² M2 / (M2 P2² ) = 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that exponent. 2/9 is about 0.222, cube root is around 0
