Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The problem says the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait—quantum states are supposed to be normalized, right? Oh, wait no, maybe not. I remember that the state vector needs to have a magnitude of 1. Let me check: the square of each component's absolute value sum should be 1. So |-1|^2 is 1, 2 squared is 4, 1 squared is 1. So 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the state is not normalized. That's a problem. So I think I need to normalize it first before proceeding. Because probabilities are based on the normalized state.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To normalize, I need to divide each component by the square root of the sum of squares. The sum is 6, so the normalization factor is sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T. I'll note that down: ψ = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].

Next, the observable is given by matrix P. The matrix P has rows: first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, so to find the probability of measuring 0, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are its eigenvalues.

So I should find the eigenvalues of P. Let's write down the matrix P:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Hmm, finding the eigenvalues might be a bit tricky. Maybe there's some symmetry here. Let me think. The matrix looks symmetric, so it should be diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.

Let me denote the matrix as P, and find its trace and determinant to find the eigenvalues. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. So 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0.

The determinant might be a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe I can guess the eigenvalues. Let's see, perhaps the matrix has some eigenvectors that are easy to find.

Wait, another approach: let me look for eigenvectors. Suppose v is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ. So Pv = λ v.

Let me consider some simple vectors. For instance, what about [1, 0, 1]^T? Let's apply P to it.

P * [1,0,1]^T = [ (0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1), ( (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 ), (0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1) ].

Calculating each component:

First component: 0*1 + 0 +0 = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)(1) + 0 + (1/√2)(1) )= (2/√2) = sqrt(2).

Third component: 0 +0 +0 =0.

So P * [1,0,1]^T = [0, sqrt(2), 0 ]^T.

Hmm, so [1,0,1] is an eigenvector? Let's see: if I compare to [1,0,1], the result is [0, sqrt(2), 0]. So this suggests that [1,0,1] isn't an eigenvector because the result isn't a scalar multiple of the original vector. Wait, unless I made a mistake. Wait, the original vector is [1,0,1], and the result is [0, sqrt(2), 0], which is not a scalar multiple of [1,0,1]. So that vector isn't an eigenvector.

Hmm, maybe try another vector. What about [1, 0, -1]? Let's compute P times that.

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) =0.

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1 -1)/√2 = 0.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) =0.

So P * [1,0,-1]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T. So that vector is in the null space of P. So it's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So that's one eigenvalue: 0.

So the corresponding eigenspace is at least one-dimensional. So the multiplicity of 0 as an eigenvalue is perhaps 1, but maybe more.

Now, considering the trace is zero, and one eigenvalue is 0, the sum of other eigenvalues must be zero as well.

Let me try to find another eigenvector. Maybe consider a vector orthogonal to [1,0,-1], like [0,1,0].

Applying P to [0,1,0]^T:

First component: 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 = 1/√2.

Second component: (1/√2)*0 + 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 = 0.

Third component: 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 = 1/√2.

So, P * [0,1,0]^T = [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]^T.

Hmm, let's see if this is a scalar multiple of [0,1,0]. It doesn't look like it. So [0,1,0] is not an eigenvector. Maybe I can find another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix has two eigenvalues, say, a and -a, besides 0, because the trace is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0. Let's test this hypothesis.
