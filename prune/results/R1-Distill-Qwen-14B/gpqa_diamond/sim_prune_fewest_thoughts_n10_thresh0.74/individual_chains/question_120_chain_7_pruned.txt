Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax in arcseconds (like plx) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit of plx. So, if we consider a unit increase in parallax, how does the number of stars in that range change?

I think I need to model this. Let's imagine that the stars are uniformly distributed in space, which probably means that their number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

But parallax is 1/d, so let's express distance d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. 

Wait, but when plx increases, d decreases. So higher plx means closer stars. So, the volume element when considering a change in plx would involve the distance. Let me think about how the volume changes with plx.

In three dimensions, the volume around a star at distance d is a spherical shell. The thickness of the shell would be a small change in d, say dd. The volume of that shell is about 4πd² dd. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πd² and multiplied by the thickness dd.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, maybe we need to express the volume in terms of plx instead.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Because taking derivative: d/d plx (1/plx) is -1/plx².

Wait, so dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Oh, so the change in distance (dd) is proportional to 1/(plx squared) times the change in plx.

But the volume element is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, and dd from above:

Volume =
