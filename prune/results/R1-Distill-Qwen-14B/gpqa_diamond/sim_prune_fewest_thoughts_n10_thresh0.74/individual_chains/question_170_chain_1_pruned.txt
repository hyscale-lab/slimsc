Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a particular spin state.

The spin state given is (3i, 4). Hmm, wait, I think that notation represents a two-component vector, right? So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. Oh right, because spin-1/2 particles like electrons have spin states that are two-dimensional.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨A⟩ = ⟨χ| A |χ⟩, where A is the operator. So for S_y, I need to find χ† (sigma_y) χ, where sigma_y is the Pauli matrix for y.

The Pauli matrix sigma_y is given as:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Wait, so sigma_y is that matrix. Right, and the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times sigma. So S_y is (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation value of sigma_y in the state χ.

Wait, no. Wait, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation of sigma_y. Because S = (ħ/2) σ. So, yes.

So first, I need to compute ⟨σ_y⟩, then multiply by ħ/2.

So let's compute ⟨σ_y⟩.

The state vector is (3i, 4). Let's denote this as a column vector, so χ = [3i; 4].

The adjoint of χ, χ†, is the row vector [3i*, 4*], which for real numbers is [ -3i, 4 ], but wait, 4 is real, so 4* is 4. Wait no, 3i is a complex number. 3i* is -3i because i* is -i.

So χ† = [ -3i, 4 ]

Now, σ_y is the matrix:
0   -i
i    0

So, χ† σ_y χ is χ† multiplied by σ_y multiplied by χ.

Let me compute that.

First, compute σ_y * χ.

σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, χ is 2x1.

Multiplying:

First component:
(0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i

Second component:
(i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0. Since i² is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So the second component is -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i; -3 ]

Wait wait wait, let me double-check that:

Wait, matrix multiplication: each component is row of σ_y times column of χ.

First row of σ_y is [0, -i]. So dot product with [3i, 4]^T:

0*3i + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) → -4i.

Second row is [i, 0]. So i*3i + 0*4 = 3i² + 0 → 3(-1) → -3.

So yes, σ_y χ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† (σ_y χ) is the dot product of [ -3i, 4 ] and [ -4i; -3 ].

Compute each term:

-3i * (-4i) → 12 i^2 → 12*(-1) → -12.

4 * (-3) → -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait wait, so χ† σ_y χ is -24.

Wait, no. Wait, the first term is (-3i) * (-4i) = (12)(i^2) = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term is 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding both terms: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24.

Wait, but the state vector is [3i, 4]. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let me write it as a matrix product step by step.

Compute χ† σ_y χ.

σ_y is:

[0  -i]
[i   0]

So χ is [3i, 4]^T.

σ_y χ would be:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 -4i = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) +0*4 = 3i² +0 = -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Then, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† (σ_y χ) is [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ].

Calculating each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*( -3 )= -12.

Adding: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24.

But wait, the state vector needs to be normalized. Because the expectation value calculation requires that the state is normalized. So, I should check if χ is a unit vector.

Compute the norm squared:
