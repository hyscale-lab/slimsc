Okay, so I need to figure out what Compound X is and then determine the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm. Let's start by analyzing the given IR and NMR data.

Looking at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests there's either an -OH group or maybe an -NH stretch. But looking at the other peaks, 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might indicate aromatic rings, maybe C=C stretching. So, putting that together, perhaps it's a substituted aromatic compound with a carbonyl group. Maybe a benzene ring with a ketone substituent?

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's parse each peak:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Broad usually means it's exchanging, so maybe an -OH proton. But wait, another thought: sometimes aldehydic protons can be around 9-10, but they're usually sharp. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12. But the IR had a strong peak at 1720 cm-1 which could be a carbonyl, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad. But wait, the IR also has a peak in 3400–2500, which often is a strong -OH stretch. However, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very strong. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde? But the 1720 cm-1 is more likely a ketone or ester.

Wait, but let me think again. The NMR peak at 10.5 is a singlet, broad. Could it be a phenol O-H? Phenols can be broad, but their protons are usually around 5-7 ppm. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, an acidic proton like in a carboxylic acid. Let me think: the IR at 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl, which fits with a carboxylic acid (since they have a strong carbonyl around 1700). Also, the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm, so that fits. So maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking further, the NMR has a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests para-substituted aromatic protons. So benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but in benzoic acid, the COOH would be a substituent on the benzene. So if the substituents are in para positions, perhaps the benzene has a COOH group and another substituent opposite to it. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester group, but then the NMR would be different.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These seem to be from an alkyl chain. The 0.9 triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group (like an ethyl). The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a CH(CH3) group. Wait, let me think. The triplet at 0.9 probably is a terminal CH2CH3. The 1.4 doublet with 3H: that's a CH3 attached to a CH. So maybe like a -CH(CH3)2 group? Or more accurately, perhaps a CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, but the integration is 3H, so it's a methyl group attached to a CH. So maybe a -CH(CH2CH3)CH3? Not sure. Also, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet integrating to 1H. So perhaps a CH group adjacent to another CH2 or something.

Putting that together, perhaps there's an ethyl group attached via a chain to the benzene ring. Let me think about the possible structure.

So, the benzene ring has a substituent which is a carbonyl group (from the IR at 1720), perhaps a ketone. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a ketone's neighboring protons. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would be something like benzene with a COOH group and another substituent. Let me see.

Wait, the NMR has 10.5 ppm as a singlet for 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would be the OH proton. But then, the 1720 cm-1 would be the carbonyl. So the structure could be a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent.

Looking at the aromatic protons: para-substituted. So perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene. So substituents are in the para positions.

So, the benzene has a COOH and another group at para positions. Let's think about the other substituent. The NMR shows peaks that suggest an alkyl chain.

Looking at the non-aromatic protons:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → perhaps a CH group adjacent to a branch.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → maybe CH2 groups.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → a CH2CH3 group.

Putting that together, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. For example, the substituent could be a CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3 or something like that. Wait, but the protons don't seem to add up directly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's think: the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That could be a CH attached to two different groups. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group para to an isobutyl group. So the substituents are COOH and an isobutyl group at para positions.

Wait, but the COOH would have a proton at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet. So the benzene would have substituents at positions 1 and 4. So, positions 1: COOH and position 4: an isobutyl group.

So the structure would be 4-(substituted)benzoic acid. Let me think about the substituent. The substituent must be an isobutyl group.

Wait, the isobutyl group has the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait: isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, when attached to the benzene, it would be -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but looking at the NMR:

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely the terminal CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) is the CH adjacent to the benzene.

So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Let's think about the structure.

If we have a benzene ring with a substituent that is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group, then the structure is a para-substituted benzene with substituents at 1 and 4. So, the substituent is an isobutyl group. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2 attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the NMR's substituent would then be a CH2CH(CH3)2. Let me break it down.

The isobutyl group is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2 → no, that's a tert-butyl group. Wait, no. Wait, isobutyl is CH2CH2CH3 but that's not right. Let me think: actually, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no. Isobutyl is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait. Let me clarify.

Butyl groups have four carbons. The iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, wait. The iso-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Let me get this straight.

The butyl group can be in several forms:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (straight chain)
- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3) - no, wait, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, no. Wait, iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the correct structure of iso-butyl is:

The iso-butyl group is a three-carbon chain where the second carbon is connected to two methyl groups. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- but that's not correct. Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) ? No, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the NMR data to figure out the structure.

The non-aromatic signals:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is a terminal methyl group, so a CH2CH3.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group adjacent to something else.

So, the structure is likely a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3 group, but that would be a pentyl group? Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but maybe it's part of a larger substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think.

If the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch at the second carbon, then the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But then, the NMR would show different patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a secondary carbon attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is -CH(CH2CH3)CH3. Wait, that would be a tert-butyl group. Let me see.

If the substituent is a tert-butyl group, then the structure would be -C(CH3)3 attached to the benzene. Then, the NMR would show a singlet for the 9H of the tert-butyl group. But in the given NMR data, I don't see any singlet except the 1H at 10.5 ppm. So tert-butyl is probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3)CH3 group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but another approach: the substituent is an ethyl group attached through a CH. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that might be a longer chain.

Wait, maybe it's a 3-methylpentyl group or something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene. Let me think about the NMR.

The 0.9 ppm triplet would be the CH2CH3 at the end. Then, the 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be the next CH2, and the 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH.

So, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let me draw it:

The benzene ring has a substituent at position 4 (para to COOH) which is an isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps it's better to think of it as a -CH(CH2CH3)CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that's not iso-butyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent would be a secondary ethyl group. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's imagine: the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. But that would have more hydrogens than accounted for.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (3H) is a CH2CH3.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene. But that would be a butyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, the chain is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But then, the NMR would have:

- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t) as it is a triplet because it's adjacent to a CH2.

The next CH2 would be the one attached to the CH(CH3), so that would be a quartet (from coupling with the adjacent CH(CH3) and the next CH2). But the data shows the 1.7 ppm as a multiplet for 2H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. So, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary carbon attached to the benzene. So benzene-CH(CH2CH3)CH3. So that's an isopropyl group attached. Wait, but let me think about the NMR.

If the substituent is an isopropyl group:

The substituent would be -CH(CH3)2. So, the NMR would show a septet for the CH3 groups attached to the CH. But in the given data, there's a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which would correspond to a CH3 attached to a CH. So, maybe that's the case.

Wait, but if the substituent is -CH(CH3)2, then the CH would have two adjacent CH3 groups. So, the CH would be a septet (splitting into seven peaks due to coupling with six protons from two CH3 groups). But in the given NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, not a septet. So maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent isn't an isopropyl but an isobutyl group. Let me think again about the substituent.

If the substituent is an isobutyl group, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that would make it a tertiary carbon. Alternatively, perhaps it's benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3. No, that's a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures given the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, okay, looking at the options, let's see which ones fit.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzene has a sec-butyl group at position 4 and a COOH at position 1. So, the substituents are para.

The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Wait, sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, perhaps I need to get this right.

Wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is: the substituent is attached to the benzene at the second carbon of a butyl chain. So, it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, wait.

Wait, butyl groups can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. The "sec-butyl" group is a secondary butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, that would be a tertiary butyl group.

Wait, no. The secondary butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3). No, wait, perhaps I should consider the structure.

Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl group is: the substituent is attached to the benzene at a carbon that has two other carbons attached. So, it's a -CH2CH(CH3)- group where the benzene is attached to the first carbon, which is connected to a CH group, which is connected to another CH3. So, the structure would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2 attached to the benzene? No, that would be a tert-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the substituent for option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, benzoic acid has the structure: benzene ring with a COOH group. The substituent at position 4 would be a sec-butyl group.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, no. Wait, the correct structure of the sec-butyl group is:

The substituent is attached to the benzene at the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is:

It's a four-carbon chain where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So, it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out. The benzene ring is attached to a carbon that is connected to two other carbons. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. I'm getting a bit stuck on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a three-carbon chain where the benzene is attached to the middle carbon. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, that's a tertiary butyl group again.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituent in option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, meaning the point of attachment is on the second carbon of a butyl chain.

So, the structure would be benzene-COOH at position 1, and at position 4, a substituent which is a butyl chain where the benzene is attached to the second carbon. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about how the substituent would appear in the NMR.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, that would be a four-carbon chain, which is a butyl group. The point of attachment is on the first carbon (primary), but if it's a sec-butyl, the point is on the second carbon. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3. That would be a secondary substituent, so the structure is benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3. But then that's a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. No, that's again a tertiary structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The non-aromatic signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH group adjacent to other groups.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH2CH3 group.

Putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3 group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Wait, but that would make it a isoamyl group? No, isoamyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. So, the structure would be benzene-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. But that would be a four-carbon substituent, which is a butyl group with a methyl branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary carbon connected to a methyl and a ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3 group, making it a pentyl group. But that might not fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that would be a tertiary structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group, making the substituent a butyl group with a methyl branch.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon chain with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

Wait, so the structure would be benzene-COOH at position 1, and at position 4, a substituent -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3. That can't be right because that would be a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, but that's a tertiary butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, for the substituent, it's a four-carbon chain where the benzene is attached to the second carbon. So, structure: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. But that would be a tertiary substituent.

This is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about what the reaction is. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I recall that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which is used to reduce carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) to methylene groups. But wait, wait, no, the Wolff-Kishner is for converting carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) into methylene groups, typically producing alkanes. Alternatively, in the presence of an acid like HI, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, another thought: if the compound has a carbonyl group, perhaps upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it forms a methyl group.

Wait, but the Wolff-Kishner reaction typically converts a carbonyl group (like ketone or aldehyde) into a methylene group (-CH2-), eliminating the oxygen. But I might be getting this mixed up with another reaction.

Wait, I think that when a carbonyl (like a ketone) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction known as the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction to eliminate the carbonyl group, forming a methylene group.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact reaction. Oh wait, in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, a carbonyl group (like ketone, aldehyde) is converted into a methylene group (-CH2-) by heating with a strong base and a source of hydrogen (like NH3, then H2O). Alternatively, using P and HI as a reagent could be a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a benzoin condensation or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the product. If the starting compound has a carbonyl group, and the reaction replaces it with a methylene group, then the product would have a CH2 group where the carbonyl was.

So, if Compound X is a benzoic acid, upon reaction, it might lose the COOH group and gain a CH2 group. Alternatively, if the carbonyl is part of an ester or ketone, perhaps it's converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, let's think about the data again. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl. The NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is likely an -OH, perhaps from a carboxylic acid.

So, if the compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, in a benzoic acid, the carbonyl is part of the COOH group. So, if we reduce the COOH group, what would that yield? Reduction of a carboxylic acid typically isn't straightforward. Carboxylic acids are generally resistant to reduction under most conditions. But perhaps in this case, with a strong reducing agent like red phosphorus and HI, the COOH group is reduced.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a benzoin condensation, but that's for aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products given the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If that's the starting material, and it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? If the carbonyl is reduced, perhaps the COOH would become a CH2OH group, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction would convert the COOH into a CH3 group.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but the reagents don't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a elimination, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, if Compound X is a benzoic acid (from the NMR and IR data), and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is converting the COOH into a CH2 group.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The COOH group would have a carbonyl (C=O). If it's reduced to a CH2 group, then the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group and the substituent.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group.

Wait, but looking at the options, the product isn't among them. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: if the starting compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone), the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a Witting reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me analyze the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the starting material is this, and the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl (COOH group) to a CH2 group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but toluene has a methyl group, but in this case, it's a CH2 group.

Wait, but the options don't include that. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution replacing the O of the carbonyl with something else.

Wait, another thought: HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ketone undergoing a substitution. For example, if the starting compound is a ketone, adding HI would lead to a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by I.

But in the given options, none of them are iodinated. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the carbonyl group.

Wait, considering all this, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene group, converting the benzoic acid into a toluene derivative.

But let's think about the product. If the benzoic acid is converted into a toluene ring with a substituent, then the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group and another substituent.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So that's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH3, making it a benzene ring with a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which is the same as option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the COOH is reduced to a CH3 group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which is option D.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option C as the starting material, and the product would be option D.

Wait, but the question is asking for the product, not the starting material. So, if the starting material is option C, the product is option D.

So, the answer would be option D.


To determine the final product of the reaction, we first analyze the given IR and NMR data to identify Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Indicate aromatic C=C stretching, confirming the presence of a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group adjacent to other groups.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from CH₂ groups.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely from a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a terminal CH₂CH₃ group.

From the NMR data, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The non-aromatic signals indicate the presence of an alkyl chain, likely a secondary butyl group (-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃). Combining this with the IR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions suggest a reduction of the carbonyl group in the carboxylic acid. Red phosphorus and HI typically reduce a carbonyl group (-C=O) to a methylene group (-CH₂). Therefore, the COOH group in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a CH₃ group, resulting in **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** (Option D).

### Final Answer:
The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C), and the product of the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** (Option D).

Answer: D
