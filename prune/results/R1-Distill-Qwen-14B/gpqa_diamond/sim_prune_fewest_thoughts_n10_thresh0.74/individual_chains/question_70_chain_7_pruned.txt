Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions and then asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, C2v, etc. Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules. So I need to figure out what E is and then determine its symmetry.

Let me break down the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C. The product C is bright red. I'm trying to think of bright red compounds. Oh, maybe something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal complex? Wait, when I think of a red product, I might think of something like sulfur, but sulfur is yellow. Alternatively, maybe a compound like MnO4^-? Oh wait, KMnO4 is a deep purple, but maybe another compound. Alternatively, maybe something like Fe(OH)3, but that's more of a reddish-brown precipitate. Hmm, not sure yet. Wait, another thought: maybe product C is SO3^2- or something else. Alternatively, perhaps a nitrate or sulfate? I'm not sure.

2. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Gas D reacting with C... Hmm, what gases are involved in such reactions? Oh, maybe D is something like chlorine gas (Cl2), which is a gas. Alternatively, it could be another halogen. Let's think: if C is a sulfite (like SO3^2-), and D is Cl2, then maybe E is SO2Cl2 or something similar. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if C is a nitrite, maybe reacting with Cl2 would form some chloride. Wait, but E is extremely hazardous, so maybe it's a highly toxic gas, like hydrogen cyanide? Or something like phosgene? Hmm, not sure.

3. Then, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is treated with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Let's think: if C is a sulfite (SO3^2-), then reacting with water might produce sulfurous acid (H2SO3), which is a weak acid, but wait, H
