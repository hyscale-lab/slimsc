Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine plants. Hmm, let's see. The setup is that they're looking for genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants: single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

The results they got from testing these mutants' resistance are given. The wild-type has 100% resistance. The mutants' resistances are as follows:
- g1:75%
- g2:0%
- g3:50%
- g1g3:10%
- g2g3:0%
- g1g2:0%

So the question is about what conclusion can be drawn about the interaction of these genes.

I remember that gene interaction can involve concepts like epistasis, pleiotropy, redundancy, etc. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but in this context, maybe it's about how the same gene affects multiple downstream genes. Redundancy means two genes have overlapping functions.

The question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. So if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes it regulates won't be expressed, which could impact resistance.

Looking at the data:

G2's single mutant has 0% resistance. So that suggests that G2 is crucial for resistance. If it's a transcription factor, then knocking it out would eliminate the production of certain downstream genes necessary for resistance.

G1's mutant is 75%, which is a significant drop, but not as severe as g2. G3's mutant is 50%, so it's contributing but not as much as G2.

Now the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, there's no resistance. But wait, G2 alone already gives 0%â€”so what's the effect of knocking out G1 in addition? Well, the resistance is same as when G2 is alone. So maybe G1's function is downstream of G2, or they're in the same pathway. Because if G2 is upstream, then without G2, G1 can't do anything. So the double mutant would have same effect as G2 single mutant.

g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is even lower than either single mutant. G1 is 75%, G3 is 50%, but together they're 10%. That suggests some kind of additive or synergistic effect? Or perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. Because knocking both out makes the situation worse.

g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as G2 single mutant. So when G2 is knocked out, G3's effect is nullified. That makes me think that G3 acts downstream of G2. Because if G2 is not there, then G3 can't function, so knocking out G3 in that case adds nothing.

So trying to map this. Let's think about the hierarchy.

G2 seems to be the most important. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then it might regulate G1 and/or G3.

Looking at the double mutants:

In g1g2, the resistance is same as g2. So without G2, knocking out G1 doesn't change anything. So G1's function might depend on G2. So maybe G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, in g2g3, the resistance is same as g2. So G3's function is also dependent on G2, or G3 is downstream of G2.

Now, what
