Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about two compounds, A and B, which when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce different diketones. I need to figure out which starting materials they are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when compounds undergo certain reactions, like maybe a von Braun degradation or something similar, they can form diketones. Wait, sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid... Oh wait, that's the nitrous acid environment. Nitrous acid is often involved in reactions like the diazotization of amines, but maybe in this context, it's a different reaction. Oh, right! I think that when a ketone or aldehyde is treated with nitrous acid (HNO2) under acidic conditions, it might not do much, but wait, perhaps this is a case of the Stephen reduction or another kind of reaction. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a geminal diol or something else.

Wait, another thought: the reaction conditions are HCl, NaNO2, and water. That sounds familiar for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide, but no, that's with H2O and acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a situation where an alcohol is being converted into a ketone. Oh wait! I think I remember something about the oxidation of secondary alcohols. Oh wait no, secondary alcohols oxidize to ketones, but that typically uses something like KMnO4 or CrO3.

Wait a minute, perhaps this is a case where an amino group is being converted into a carbonyl. Oh, right! The hydrolysis of an imine or something like that. Wait, but the reaction is HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh, I think that's the reaction where a nitro compound is involved, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of the HNO2 being used in a substitution reaction, but I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, another angle. The products are diketones. So, each starting material must have a functional group that, upon reaction with HCl, NaNO2, and water, forms two ketone groups. How can that happen?

Wait,
