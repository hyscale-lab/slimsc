Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density among the options given. Hmm, remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So I need to calculate or compare the density for each option.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is known. Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So this planet would have the same density as Earth. So density here is 5.5.

Option b) has 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait, no. The option says the planet has a density of 5.5. Oh, but wait, the question is asking which has the highest density, so I need to see the actual density for each case.

Wait, no, no. Let me not get confused. Option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So what is its density? Oh, wait no, the question gives the density. So no need to calculate, it's 5.5. So same as Earth.

Option c) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm. Same composition implies same density, right? Because composition affects density. So if it's the same composition, density is same. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet would also have 5.5. But wait, what about the mass? If it's more massive, but same radius? Or maybe the radius increases. Wait, but if the composition is same, the density is same regardless of mass. Because density is mass per volume, and if the mass increases but volume increases proportionally, then density remains same.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let's say Earth has mass M and radius R. The planet in option c has mass 5M. Since it's same composition, the density (mass/volume) is same as Earth, which is 5.5. So its density is 5.5. Wait, but wait, wait, perhaps the volume scales with mass in a certain way. Or maybe not? Because density is mass divided by volume. If the planet is more massive but same density, then its volume must be (5M)/(density), which would be larger than Earth's. So yes, same density as Earth.

Option d) is a
