Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here. Itâ€™s about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, and it's radiating power. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that oscillating charges can emit radiation, especially in certain configurations. The problem mentions the symmetry axis is along the z-axis, so I guess the shape is sort of like a prolate spheroid, elongated along z.

The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function f of lambda and theta. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction at theta = 30 degrees and the form of f.

Wait, the options give different fractions and power dependencies on lambda. So I think I need to recall how the radiation pattern of such a dipole or charge distribution looks. Oh right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is typically a function of cos(theta) squared. Because the power usually falls off as (sin(theta))^2 or something similar.

But wait, the problem isn't exactly a dipole. It's a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating. Hmm, but maybe it's a dipole-like oscillator. Alternatively, maybe it's a quadrupole? No, I think for an oscillating charge distribution, the dominant term is the dipole radiation. So dipole radiation patterns usually have a sin^2(theta) dependence.

Wait, no, dipole radiation's intensity in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to (sin(theta))^2. So the maximum intensity is when theta is 90 degrees, right? Because sin(90) is 1. So if the maximum is A, then at theta=90, it's A. But the question is asking about theta=30 degrees.

Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the power is integrated over all solid angles, and the maximum is A. So the fraction at 30 degrees would be f(theta=30) divided by the integral of f over all solid angles, but wait, no. The maximum power A is the maximum value of f, but wait, no, the total power is the integral of f times dOmega, and A is the maximum value of f times dOmega? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says
