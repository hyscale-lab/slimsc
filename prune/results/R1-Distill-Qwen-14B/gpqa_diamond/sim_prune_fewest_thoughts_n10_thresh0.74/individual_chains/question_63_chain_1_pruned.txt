Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule's transition after absorbing a photon. Hmm, let's see. So the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. The question is asking about the momentum of the photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state—so that's the lowest energy state, right? For a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state would be the state where both vibrational and rotational energy are at their lowest levels. So the molecule is in its ground state. Now, when it absorbs a photon, it's going to transition to the next possible state with the lowest energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

So, the options are all different momenta. Momentum p is related to the photon's energy. Because photons carry energy E = hν, and momentum p = E/c. Since c is the speed of light, which is a constant, the momentum depends on the frequency of the photon.

But wait, the question is about the molecule's transition. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The molecule's energy comes from both rotation and vibration. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either change its vibrational state, rotational state, or both. But the problem says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that implies the smallest possible energy increase, which would be a change in either rotation or vibration, whichever requires the least energy.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Wait, the rigid rotor model has quantized rotational energy levels with J being the rotational quantum number. For a diatomic molecule, the rotational state can't be J=0 because of the zero-point energy, but wait no, J can be zero, but for a rigid rotor, the energy is (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So the ground state is J=0, which has energy 0, but that's not possible because in real molecules, rotation can't be zero due to the bond length and the angular momentum, but I think in the model, J=0 is allowed.

Wait, but maybe the molecule is in its lowest energy state
