Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options are about the possible transition routes and their probabilities.

Wait, dipole transitions are governed by the selection rules, right? From what I remember, for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen, the selection rules are: Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the transition is only allowed if these rules are followed.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It goes to n=1, l=0, m=0. But wait, that's a big change in n. So it must go through an intermediate state, hence the two-step transition.

First, the state |3,0,0⟩ can transition to a state where l is 1, because Δl can only change by ±1. So for the first step, the possible l is 1. So the first transition goes from l=0 to l=1. Then, from l=1, the next transition must go to l=0, since that's the final state.

So the first transition: n=3, l=0 → n=?, l=1. The second transition: n= ?, l=1 → n=1, l=0.

Wait, but the energy levels depend on n. So the first step must have a lower n than 3 because you can't go to a higher energy level in a decay. Wait no, actually, the atom is decaying, so it emits photons, so energy decreases. So the first transition must go to a higher energy state? No, wait, no. When an electron transitions down, it emits a photon. So the initial state is higher energy, so to get to a lower energy state, it might go through an intermediate.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is in the n=3 shell, l=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, which is n=1, l=0. So the energy is lower in the final state, so the atom is decaying from a higher to a lower state. But since it's a two-step transition, it must go through a state in between, probably from n=3 to n=2, or n=3 to n=1 in two steps.

Wait, but wait. The first transition must follow the selection rules. So from n=3, l=0, m=0, possible transitions are to states where l is 1 (because Δl=+1) and any m that changes by 0, ±1.

So the possible first transitions would be to |3,1, m⟩ where m= -1, 0, +1.

But wait, wait, n can change by any amount as long as the energy is correct. So from n=3, l=0, can the electron transition to n=2, l=1, and then from n=2, l=1, transition to n=1, l=0.

Because for the first step, l changes from 0 to 1, which is allowed. Then, in the second step, l changes from 1 to 0, which is also allowed (Δl= -1).

So the possible intermediate state is |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the initial state |3,0,0⟩ can transition to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩, each with some probability. Then from each of those, can they transition to |1,0,0⟩?

Wait, let's look at the second transition. From |2,1,m⟩, the transition must go to l=0, so Δl must be -1. Also, for each m, the change in m (Δm) can be 0, ±1.

So from |2,1,0⟩: possible m changes are -1, 0, +1. So in the second transition, m can go to -1, 0, +1. But the final state has m=0. So from |2,1,0⟩, you can transition to |1,0,0⟩ via Δm=0.

Similarly, from |2,1,1⟩, can you go to |1,0,0⟩? Let's see: initial m is 1, final is 0, so Δm = -1. Which is allowed. And from |2,1,-1⟩, m is -1, so Δm=+1 is allowed to reach m=0.

So all three possible intermediate states can transition to |1,0,0⟩.

Now, the question is about the probability of each path.

But wait, the options only list two-step transitions. So the possible paths are:

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. Probability 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option D: Looks like it's missing the first state in the option, but the text says → 2,1,0 →1,0,0 and 2/3.

Wait, I think the options have some typo, but probably D is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3.

Wait, but how to calculate the probabilities. Hmm.

The transition probabilities depend on the square of the dipole matrix elements. The matrix element for a transition from state |n1,l1,m1⟩ to |n2,l2,m2⟩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the spherical harmonics overlap.

Wait, the selection rules for the dipole transitions are that the matrix element is non-zero only if Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

But the actual probability also depends on the transition dipole moment, which often involves the integral of the wavefunctions.

For hydrogen, the transition probability depends on the square of the dipole matrix element. The matrix element for a transition is proportional to certain integrals involving the associated Legendre polynomials.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck on the exact calculation. Maybe I can think in terms of possible transitions and their probabilities.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It can transition to any |2,1,m⟩ where m is -1, 0, +1. So three possible intermediate states. Each of these has an equal probability? Or is there a different probability for each transition.

Wait, the matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ depends on the value of m.

Wait, the dipole matrix element ⟨2,1,m | r | 3,0,0⟩.

But r is proportional to the position vector, which in spherical coordinates is r = r (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ ). So when you expand r in spherical harmonics, it involves terms with l=1, m= -1, 0, +1.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when m is 0, ±1 because r contributes l=1.

Wait, when you have the initial state |3,0,0⟩, which is an s-orbital (l=0). The transition dipole moment would be ⟨2,1,m | r | 3,0,0⟩. Since r involves l=1, the integral will be non-zero only if m is 0, ±1. So the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

Now, the probability for each transition is proportional to the square of this matrix element.

But how much is each m?

I recall that the expectation for the matrix element squared for each m can be calculated. For the transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1.

The dipole matrix element for each m is proportional to certain factors. Let me think.

In the case of a transition from l=0 to l=1, the expectation values for m are as follows.

The matrix element is proportional to √[(l1 + l2 +1)(2l2 +1)] * something.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the possible m transitions. For each m in the intermediate state, the transition probability can be computed.

Wait, the matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get m.

Wait, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=m. So the coefficient is zero unless m is -1, 0, +1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=m is:

For m=1: √( (1 - 0)(1 + 0 +1) ) / 2? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for 0,0 and 1,m are zero except for m=1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the exact values:

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for 0,0 and 1,1 is zero because 0 +1 =1, but actually, no. Wait, no, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (l1, m1) and (l2, m2) combine to (l, m). So in our case, l1 =0, l2=1, and we want to combine to l=1, m=m.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for (0,0) and (1, m) is:

⟨1, m | 0,0; 1, m⟩.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to recall that when you combine l=0 and l=1, the possible m's are the sum of m1 and m2. So the possible m's are m = m1 + m2.

But since m1 is 0 (from l=0), m can be -1, 0, +1 (from l=1).

Wait, but for the transition dipole moment, the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{1 m}^* Y_{0 0} Y_{1 0}, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to remember that the transition probabilities from l=0 (s-orbitals) to l=1 (p-orbitals) have equal probabilities for the different m states. Or do they?

Wait, no. The probability isn't necessarily the same for each m. Because the dipole matrix elements depend on the product of the wavefunctions and the position vector, which has components in all directions.

Wait, let's think of the position vector in spherical coordinates. The components of r are proportional to sqrt(4π/3) Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,-1}.

So when you compute the matrix element ⟨2,1,m | r |3,0,0⟩, it's proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m}^* * Y_{1,0} * Y_{0,0}.

Wait, Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π), so the integral becomes ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Which is zero unless m=0, because Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,0} is orthogonal unless m=0.

Wait, no. Because Y_{1,0} is even, right?

Wait, the integral of Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,0} is zero unless m=0? Hmm, no. Wait, Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,0} is a product of spherical harmonics. The integral ∫ Y_{l1,m1} Y_{l2,m2} Y_{l3,m3} dΩ is zero unless certain conditions are met, like triangle inequality for l's and m's summing to zero.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the matrix element ⟨2,1,m | r |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero only for m=0 because the initial state has m=0 and the position operator has m components of 0, ±1.

Wait, but the position vector has Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,-1} components. So when you multiply Y_{1,m}^* (from the final state) with Y_{1, any} (from r), the integral might be non-zero.

Wait, let's imagine the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m}^* * (Y_{1,0} + Y_{1,1} e^{-iφ} + Y_{1,-1} e^{iφ}) ) * Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π), so we can ignore it for proportionality.

So the integral becomes the sum of three terms:

1. ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ
2. ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,1} e^{-iφ} dΩ
3. ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,-1} e^{iφ} dΩ

Each of these integrals is zero unless m meets certain conditions.

For the first term, ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ is non-zero only if m=0, because the integral of Y_{l,m} Y_{l',m'} is zero unless l=l', m=m'. So here, l=1 for both, m must equal 0.

For the second term, ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,1} e^{-iφ} dΩ. Let's change variables perhaps. Y_{1,1} = sqrt(3/(8π)) (x + iy). Hmm, but in terms of φ, Y_{1,1} = sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{iφ}.

Wait, so Y_{1,1} = sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{iφ}.

So the second term becomes ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,1} e^{-iφ} dΩ.

= ∫ Y_{1,m}^* (sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{iφ}) e^{-iφ} dΩ.

= sqrt(3/(4π)) ∫ Y_{1,m}^* dΩ.

Because e^{iφ} e^{-iφ} =1.

So this is sqrt(3/(4π)) times the integral of Y_{1,m}^* which is zero unless m=0.

Wait, but Y_{1,m}^* is zero except for m=0? No, Y_{1,m}^* is non-zero for any m, but the integral of Y_{1,m}^* over all solid angles is zero unless m=0. So this integral is zero unless m=0.

Similarly, the third term is ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,-1} e^{iφ} dΩ.

Y_{1,-1} is sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{-iφ}.

So substituting:

= ∫ Y_{1,m}^* (sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{-iφ}) e^{iφ} dΩ.

= sqrt(3/(4π)) ∫ Y_{1,m}^* dΩ.

Again, this is zero unless m=0.

So putting it all together, the only non-zero term is when m=0, because that's the only time any of the integrals contribute.

Wait, but that can't be right because then only the m=0 transition would be allowed. But earlier I thought that m can be -1, 0, +1.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should think in terms of the matrix elements for each m.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the position vector has components in all directions, so the transition can change m by 0, ±1.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is allowed for m=-1, 0, +1. So the squared matrix elements for each m would sum up to the total transition probability.

So the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each m.

But how much is each m's contribution?

In the case of a dipole transition, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. The dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,-1}.

When you compute the matrix element ⟨2,1,m | r |3,0,0⟩, it's the sum of three terms:

⟨2,1,m | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0⟩,
⟨2,1,m | Y_{1,1} |3,0,0⟩,
⟨2,1,m | Y_{1,-1} |3,0,0⟩.

Each of these terms is non-zero only for specific m values.

Wait, Y_{1,0} is symmetric under φ rotation, so when you have ⟨2,1,m | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0⟩, the integral would be non-zero only if m=0, because Y_{1,0} has m=0.

Similarly, Y_{1,1} has m=1, so when you multiply by Y_{1,1}, the integral would be non-zero only if m=0 +1 =1.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the matrix element ⟨2,1,m | Y_{l',m'} |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero only if m' = m because the initial state has m=0.

Wait, the matrix element is ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{l',m'} Y_{3,0,0} dΩ.

Since Y_{3,0,0} is Y_{0,0}, which is 1/sqrt(4π), the integral becomes ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{l',m'} dΩ.

So this is non-zero only if l' =1, and m' equals m.

Wait, but in the dipole operator, Y_{l',m'} can be 0, 1, or -1. Wait, no, the dipole operator's components are Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,-1}.

So for each component in the dipole operator, the matrix element would be non-zero only if m' equals m.

In this case, for the dipole operator Y_{1,0}, m' is 0. So the matrix element would be non-zero only when m=0.

Similarly, for Y_{1,1}, m' is 1 → matrix element non-zero only when m=1.

For Y_{1,-1}, m' is -1 → non-zero when m=-1.

So each of the three components (x, y, z) of the dipole operator contributes to different m transitions.

Thus, the matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is the sum of three terms: each term corresponds to a component of the dipole operator (Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,-1}) and contributes when m=0, m=1, m=-1 respectively.

So the squared matrix element for each m is the sum of the squares of each contributing term.

Assuming that each of these terms is of equal magnitude (since the dipole operator's components are symmetric), then the probability for each transition (m=0, m=1, m=-1) would be the same.

Wait, but in reality, the contributions might not be the same. For example, the Y_{1,0} component is real and even, while Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1} are complex and might have different overlaps.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the three terms contributes equally, making the probabilities for each m the same.

If that's the case, then the total transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ with m=-1,0,+1 would be split equally among the three possibilities. So each has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, but wait. The matrix element is the sum of three terms, each for m=0, m=1, m=-1. If each term's contribution is the same, then the sum of their squares would be three times the square of one term. But the probability is |sum|^2, which would be the sum of the squares plus cross terms.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the possible paths.

Each of the three m states in the intermediate step has a certain probability. From each of these, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ can occur.

So the overall probability is the sum over all possible paths.

For each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the probability of transitioning from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is P1(m), and then the probability of transitioning from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is P2(m).

The total probability would be the sum over m of P1(m) * P2(m).

Assuming that each P1(m) is equal (each 1/3), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each m in the first step is proportional to (2l+1)δ_{m,0}, but that might not apply here.

Wait, another approach. The dipole transition probability is given by Fermi's Golden Rule, which states that the transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element and the density of final states.

But in this case, since we're going from n=3 to n=2 (assuming), and then to n=1, perhaps each step's matrix element contributes.

But maybe it's more straightforward to think about the possible paths and their probabilities.

Each of the three possible intermediate states (m= -1, 0, +1) can transition to the final state.

But the probabilities for each of these first steps (to m=-1, 0, +1) are not necessarily the same.

Wait, I think the transition probabilities are proportional to the square of the matrix elements. The matrix element for each m is ⟨2,1,m | r |3,0,0⟩.

Assuming that each of these is the same (which might not be the case), the probability for each transition would be the same.

But I'm not sure if the matrix elements are equal for each m. Let me think about the matrix elements.

The matrix element for m=0 would involve terms where the dipole operator Y_{1,0} is present. The matrix element for m=1 would involve Y_{1,1}, and for m=-1, Y_{1,-1}.

The matrix elements for each m are given by:

⟨2,1,m | r |3,0,0⟩ = ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* r Y_{3,0,0} dΩ.

But r is in the direction of the position vector, which can be expressed in spherical harmonics as r = r (Y_{1,0} + Y_{1,1} e^{-iφ}/sqrt(2) + Y_{1,-1} e^{iφ}/sqrt(2)) ) multiplied by some constants.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix elements.

The matrix element for m=0 is:

⟨2,1,0 | r |3,0,0⟩.

Since the initial state has l=0, and r has components l=1, the matrix element is non-zero only for transitions where the final m is 0.

Similarly, for m=1, the matrix element is non-zero because r has a component with m=1.

Wait, but the initial state has m=0, so the matrix element would involve the product of Y_{1,0} (from r) with Y_{2,1,m} and Y_{3,0,0}.

But Y_{3,0,0} is Y_{0,0}, so the integral becomes ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Which simplifies to ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

This integral is non-zero only when m=0, because Y_{2,1,m}^* and Y_{1,0} would require that m =0.

Wait, no. Because Y_{2,1,m} is for l=2, m= m.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the selection rules again.

Wait, the integral ∫ Y_{l2,m2}^* Y_{l1,m1} Y_{l3,m3} dΩ is zero unless certain conditions are met. Specifically, it's non-zero only if l1 + l2 ≥ l3, and |l1 - l2| ≤ l3, and m2 + m3 = m1.

Wait, in this case, Y_{l2,m2} is Y_{2,1,m}, Y_{l1,m1} is Y_{1,0}, and Y_{l3,m3} is Y_{0,0}.

So l1=1, m1=0; l2=2, m2=m; l3=0, m3=0.

Wait, no, the integral is:

∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π), so it's a constant.

So the integral becomes ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Which is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. So this is non-zero only if m=0, because for the product Y_{2,1,m} Y_{1,0} to have an l=0 component, the m's must add to zero. So m + 0 = 0 → m=0.

Wait, that suggests that this integral is non-zero only when m=0.

Similarly, for the matrix element to m=1:

When you have Y_{2,1,1}^*, Y_{1,0}, the integral would require that m + 0 = 0 → m=0, but you're considering m=1. So the integral is zero. Therefore, the matrix element for m=1 is zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because earlier I thought that m could change by ±1.

Ah, I think I made a mistake. The dipole operator has components that can cause m to change by ±1 or 0.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the matrix elements for each m.

Wait, when you have the dipole operator, which has components in l=1, m=-1, 0, +1. The matrix element for each m is:

⟨2,1,m | r |3,0,0⟩.

But r involves all three components (x, y, z), which correspond to m=0, +1, -1.

So for each component of r, the transition can change m by -1, 0, +1.

Wait, let me think of the dipole operator as having three components: r_x, r_y, r_z.

Each of these corresponds to m = 0, +1, -1 respectively.

So the matrix element is the sum of three terms:

⟨2,1,m | r_x |3,0,0⟩,

⟨2,1,m | r_y |3,0,0⟩,

⟨2,1,m | r_z |3,0,0⟩.

Each term is proportional to ⟨2,1,m | Y_{1,m'} |3,0,0⟩.

Wait, Y_{1,0} corresponds to r_z.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express each component in terms of spherical harmonics.

r_x = sqrt(4π/3) Y_{1,1} Y_{1,-1}^* /2 + ... Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, r_x is proportional to (Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1}) / sqrt(2), and r_y is proportional to (Y_{1,1} - Y_{1,-1})/(i sqrt(2)), and r_z is proportional to Y_{1,0}.

So, the matrix element becomes:

⟨2,1,m | r_x |3,0,0⟩ = ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* [sqrt(4π/3) (Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1})/(2 sqrt(2)) ) ] Y_{3,0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{3,0,0} is Y_{0,0}, so it's a constant.

So the integral becomes sqrt(4π/3)/(2 sqrt(2)) ) * ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* (Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1}) dΩ.

Which is sqrt(4π/3)/(2 sqrt(2)) ) [ ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{1,1} dΩ + ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{1,-1} dΩ ].

Each of these integrals is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The integral ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{1,1} dΩ is non-zero only if 1 and 2 can combine to make some l, but wait, actually, when you multiply Y_{1,1} and Y_{2,1,m}^*, the resulting function must have m= m -1.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach: if the dipole operator allows transitions where m changes by 0, ±1, then for each m in the intermediate state, whether it can be reached depends on the matrix element.

But perhaps the key point is that the transition can go to any m between -1 and +1, but the probabilities might not be the same for each m.

In particular, the transition probabilities for m=0 might be higher than for m=±1.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the options.

Looking at the options, only options A, B, C, and D have specific m's and probabilities.

Option A: goes through m=0, probability 1/3.

Option B: goes through m=1, probability 1/4.

Option C: goes through m=-1, probability 1/4.

Option D: goes through m=0, probability 2/3.

Wait, the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths. Since each path has a certain probability, the sum should be 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question says the transition is via two dipole transitions. So the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible two-step paths.

Each path goes through one intermediate m. But the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

Assume the probability for each m in the first step is P(m), and then from each m, the probability to reach the final state is Q(m).

So the total probability is sum over m of P(m) * Q(m).

But what are P(m) and Q(m)?

If the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ has probability P(m), and then from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ has probability Q(m), then the total is the sum of P(m)*Q(m).

But what are these probabilities?

If we can compute the ratio of the matrix elements, perhaps we can find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps all three possible paths have the same probability, leading to a total of 3 * (probability of each path) = 1, so each path has 1/3. But looking at the options, option A has 1/3, but others have 1/4 or 2/3.

Wait, but the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability.

The options list specific transition routes, each with their own probability. So the correct option would be the one that correctly identifies the two-step transition and the correct probability.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

In the first step, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is allowed for m=-1, 0, +1. The probability for each m is the square of the matrix element for that m.

Assuming that the matrix elements for m=0 is larger than for m=±1, then the probability for m=0 would be higher.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the probability for m=0 is three times that of each of m=±1.

Wait, considering that the dipole operator allows for three possible m transitions, but the matrix element for m=0 is different.

Wait, another approach: the transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is proportional to |⟨2,1,m | r |3,0,0⟩|^2.

The square of the matrix element for each m is:

|⟨2,1,m | r |3,0,0⟩|^2 = |(⟨2,1,m | r_x |3,0,0⟩ + ⟨2,1,m | r_y |3,0,0⟩ + ⟨2,1,m | r_z |3,0,0⟩ )|^2.

But since r_x, r_y, r_z are real functions, the matrix elements are real or imaginary.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the possible m values.

Wait, perhaps each of the three possible m states has the same probability. So the probability for each m in the first step is 1/3.

If that's the case, then the total probability would be the sum over m of [1/3 * Q(m)].

But what is Q(m), the probability for each m to transition to the final state.

From |2,1,m⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed if m=0, because m can change by 0, ±1.

So from |2,1,0⟩, you can go to m=0.

From |2,1,1⟩, m=1 can only go to m=0 (Δm=-1).

From |2,1,-1⟩, m=-1 can go to m=0 (Δm=+1).

So the transition from each intermediate state to the final state is allowed.

The probability for each transition would depend on the matrix elements.

Assuming the same reasoning as before, the matrix element for each transition is non-zero only when the change in m is allowed.

But perhaps each of these has the same probability.

So if each of the three paths has a probability of (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps each transition from the intermediate state to the final state has a probability of 1/3 as well. So the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) =1/9, and the sum of all three paths would be 3*(1/9)=1/3.

But the question states that the total transition probability is given in the options. So looking at the options, option A has 1/3, which could be the sum of all paths. But the option A only shows one path, not all.

Wait, no. The options list specific transition routes, each with their own probability. So the correct option must be the one that correctly pairs a specific two-step route with its correct probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct transition is only through m=0, but that can't be right because m can change by ±1.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the possible options.

Option D says the probability is 2/3, but the path is |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩. If that's the only possible path, but I thought there were other possibilities.

But other options have lower probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps only m=0 is allowed. But that can't be right because the dipole transitions allow m changes of 0, ±1.

Wait, another approach: the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ must change l by 2 (from 0 to 0), which isn't allowed in a single dipole transition. So it must go through two transitions, each changing l by 1.

So the first transition must change l=0 to l=1, and the second must change l=1 to l=0.

So the intermediate state must have l=1.

But for the final state to have l=0, the second transition must change l=1 to l=0, which is allowed.

Now, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,m⟩, since n can decrease by 1 (from 3 to 2), and then from 2 to 1.

Wait, but the n could change by more than 1. For example, n=3 → n=1 is possible in two steps, but each step must change n by 1.

Wait, no. Wait, in hydrogen, the selection rule for n is Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but for dipole transitions, the selection rule is Δn = ±1.

Wait, no, dipole selection rules don't impose a restriction on Δn, but in practice, the transition probability decreases with larger Δn because the matrix elements become smaller.

Wait, no, the selection rules for hydrogen are Δn = 0, ±1 (for dipole transitions) but that's not correct. Actually, the selection rules for hydrogen are Δl = ±1, and Δn can be any integer except 0 and ±l, but wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen (non-relativistic) are:

Δl = ±1,

Δn = any integer except 0 and ±(n') where n' is the new principal quantum number.

Wait, so for a transition from n=3, l=0 to n=1, l=0, it requires two steps because a single step would require Δl =0, which is not allowed (since Δl must be ±1).

So the only way is via an intermediate state with l=1.

So the first step could be from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1 (Δn= -1, Δl=+1). Then, from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0 (Δn= -1, Δl= -1).

Thus, the only possible paths are through |2,1,m⟩ states.

Now, the question is about the probability of each path.

But the options don't include all possible paths, they just give specific transition routes and their probabilities.

So perhaps the correct option is D, which has a probability of 2/3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the probability for a transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is higher than to |2,1,1⟩ or |2,1,-1⟩.

Because the matrix element for m=0 is larger.

I think the transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is higher because it's the same m, and the dipole operator includes a m=0 component.

So if the first transition's probability for m=0 is 1/3 and for each of the others is 1/6, then the total would be 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/3.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each m in the first step is the same. So each has a 1/3 chance. Then, from each m, the transition to the final state has a certain probability.

But from |2,1,0⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed with m=0, so the matrix element is non-zero.

Similarly, from |2,1,1⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ can occur with m change of -1.

And from |2,1,-1⟩, the transition can occur with m change of +1.

Assuming that each of these transitions has the same probability, then each path (m=0, m=1, m=-1) contributes 1/3 * 1/3 =1/9 to the total.

Wait, but then the total probability would be 3*(1/9)=1/3. But the options don't show a 1/3 for any option except A and D (but D says 2/3).

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently.

The probability for each m is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that m.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 and m=0 is sqrt( (1+0+1)(1+0+1-2*0) )/(2*(1+1)) ) → Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the CG coefficients.

The CG coefficient for combining Y_{0,0} and Y_{1,m} to get Y_{1,m} is given by:

⟨1,m | 0,0; 1,m⟩ = sqrt( (2l +1)(2l'+1) )/(2l''+1)) ) * [ ( ... ) ]

Wait, I'm not remembering the formula exactly. Alternatively, the CG coefficient for 0,0 and 1,m is:

It's non-zero only for m=0, ±1.

The values are:

For m=1: sqrt( (1 - 0)(1 + 0 +1) ) / something.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to recall specific values. The CG coefficient for |1,0⟩ is sqrt( ( (1 -0)(1 +0 +1) ) ) / something. 

Alternatively, I think the CG coefficients for combining l=0 and l=1 are:

For m=0: sqrt( ( (1+1)(1+1-0) )/( (1+1+1) choose (1, m=0) )) ) → Not sure.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think that the matrix element for m=0 is larger than for m=±1.

So the transition probability to m=0 would be higher than to m=±1.

If the probabilities are in the ratio 1:1:1 for the three m's, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are in the ratio of (2:1:1) for m=0, m=1, m=-1.

But I'm not certain.

Assuming that the probability for m=0 is higher, the path through m=0 (option A and D) would have a higher overall probability.

Looking at the options, options A and D have probabilities of 1/3 and 2/3, respectively.

If the sum of all possible paths is 1, and the path through m=0 has probability 2/3, and the others have 1/6 each, then option D would have a probability of 2/3.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: The transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ has a higher probability because the dipole operator's m=0 component is the only one that contributes when the initial and final m are the same.

Wait, but in the matrix element, as we discussed earlier, the ⟨2,1,m | r |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero for m=0, 1, -1.

But considering that the dipole operator's matrix element for m=0 is larger than the others, the transition to m=0 would have a higher probability.

Thus, the path through m=0 would have a higher probability than the others.

Looking at the options, option D states the probability is 2/3 for the path via m=0. But I'm not sure where 2/3 comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps the only allowed transition is via m=0, but that can't be right because m can change by ±1.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula or an example.

Wait, another approach: the transition probability is given by the square of the dipole matrix element.

The matrix element for each m is given by:

⟨2,1,m | r |3,0,0⟩ ∝ ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Which is the same as ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

This is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The CG coefficient for combining l=1 and l=2 to get l=1 is non-zero only when m=0, because m=0 +0=0.

Wait, no. The CG coefficient ⟨1, m | 1, 0; 2, 0⟩ is zero unless m=0.

Wait, no, perhaps the integral is non-zero when m=0.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should give up and make an educated guess.

The correct answer is likely option A or D. Since the question says the probability is given, and the options are specific.

But wait, another thought: the probability for each m in the first transition is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The CG coefficients for |2,1,m⟩ are:

For m=0: sqrt( ( (2+1)(2-1 +1) )/(2+1) ) ) → Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, from the formula, the CG coefficient is:

⟨j', m' | j1, m1; j2, m2⟩ = ?

In this case, j1=1 (dipole), j2=0 (initial state), j'=1 (intermediate state), m1=0 (since initial state is m=0), m'=m, m2=0.

So the CG coefficient is:

sqrt( (2j' +1) )/(2j1 +1) ) * something.

Wait, probably not.

Alternatively, the CG coefficient for adding l=1 and l=0 to get l=1 is:

For m=0: sqrt( ( (1 + 0 +1) ) * ( ... ) )

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe it's better to look for a standard integral.

The integral ∫ Y_{2,1,m}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ is zero unless m=0, because the integral of Y_{l1,m1} Y_{l2,m2} is zero unless l1=l2 and m1=m2.

Wait, Y_{2,1,0} is a function, and Y_{1,0} is another. Their product integrated over all angles would be zero unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, but wait, the product Y_{2,1,0} Y_{1,0} can be expressed as a sum of spherical harmonics. The integral would be non-zero only if there's an l=0 component in the product.

But Y_{2,1,0} Y_{1,0} = sum_{l, m} coefficients Y_{l,m}.

The integral ∫ Y_{2,1,0}^* Y_{1,0} Y_{1,0} dΩ would be non-zero only if the product Y_{2,1,0} Y_{1,0} has an l=0 component.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the only non-zero term is when the product Y_{2,1,0} Y_{1,0} includes Y_{0,0}.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=2, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=0 to get l=1, m=0 is sqrt( ( (1+2+1)(2-1+1) )/( (2+1)(1+1) ) ) ) → Wait, I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficient for |1,0⟩ from |2,1,0⟩ and |1,0⟩ is sqrt( ( (1+2+1)(2-1+1) ) / ( (2+1)(1+1) ) ) )... Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is allowed (m=0), and the probability is higher than the others. So the path via m=0 would have a higher probability.

Looking at the options, option D says the probability is 2/3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is 2/3 because the path via m=0 has twice the probability of each of the other paths.

But without knowing the exact probabilities, it's hard to choose.

Wait, in some references, the transition probabilities from s states (l=0) to p states (l=1) have higher probabilities for m=0.

Thus, option A, which has m=0 and probability 1/3, might be correct if the three paths sum to 1/3 each.

But the options don't show summing, they list individual paths.

Wait, the question states that the transition occurs via two dipole transitions. So the correct option must be the one that correctly identifies the transition route and the corresponding probability.

I think option D is incorrect because the probability is 2/3, which would imply a much higher chance for that path, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: the probability for the transition via m=0 is higher because the selection rules allow it without any change in m, making it more probable.

But I'm not certain. Given the confusion, I think the correct answer is option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

But I'm not confident.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis revolves around the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The decay must proceed through an intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1. The transition probabilities depend on the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Final State**:  
   The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0), and the final state is |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0). Since a single transition cannot change l by 2 (Δl = ±1 only), the decay occurs in two steps:
   - First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ (Δn = -1, Δl = +1).
   - Second transition: |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ (Δn = -1, Δl = -1).

2. **Possible Intermediate States**:  
   The intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ can have m = -1, 0, +1. Each of these states can transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩ because Δm = 0, ±1 is allowed.

3. **Transition Probabilities**:  
   The transition probabilities depend on the square of the dipole matrix elements, which are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The matrix element ⟨2,1,m | r | 3,0,0⟩ is non-zero for m = -1, 0, +1. However, the probabilities for these transitions are not necessarily equal:
   - The transition to m=0 is generally more probable because the dipole operator includes a component with m=0, and the matrix element for m=0 is larger compared to m=±1.
   - The total probability of the decay is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ for m = -1, 0, +1.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This is plausible if the probability of the m=0 path is 1/3, assuming equal probabilities for all three paths.
   - **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is less likely because the transition to m=1 is generally less probable than to m=0.
   - **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. Similar to Option B, this is less likely because the transition to m=-1 is generally less probable than to m=0.
   - **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is plausible if the m=0 path dominates the decay, with a much higher probability than the other two paths.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the reasoning that the transition to m=0 is more probable due to the symmetry of the dipole operator, Option D, which assigns a higher probability (2/3) to the m=0 path, is the most likely answer. This aligns with the idea that the m=0 transition dominates the decay process.
