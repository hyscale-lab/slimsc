Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, let's see. The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, no, wait. The question says p + p_bar → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh right, so a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two A+ and two A- particles.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, wait, no, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. So its speed is low compared to the speed of light. That probably means we can approximate using non-relativistic equations, maybe? Or wait, but since it's an annihilation process, perhaps relativistic effects are important. Hmm, not sure yet.

The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. I'm supposed to find the velocity of particle A. The options are 0.77c, 0.96c, etc. So these are all fractions of the speed of light, but pretty high. So maybe relativistic effects are significant here.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, but what about the proton? Oh, wait, in the problem statement, the antiproton is the one that's moving slowly. So maybe the proton is at rest? Or perhaps in the center-of-momentum frame, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the annihilation process, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is low? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about conservation laws. In any annihilation process, both energy and momentum must be conserved.

But I'm not sure about the frame of reference. The problem might be assuming that the initial system is in the rest frame of the proton. Wait, no, wait. The antiproton is moving slowly. If it's moving slowly, its kinetic energy is low, so maybe its total energy is close to its rest mass energy. Hmm.

Wait, the proton and antiproton have equal rest masses. So m_p c² is about 938 MeV each. But wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So their rest masses are each about 938 MeV, but the problem doesn't specify their energies. Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest energy. So maybe
