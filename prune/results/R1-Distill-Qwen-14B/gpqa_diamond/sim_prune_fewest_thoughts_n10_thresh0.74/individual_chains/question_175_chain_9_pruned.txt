Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It's radiating, and we're supposed to find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle and the form of the function f, which represents the power per unit solid angle.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation has certain characteristics depending on the distribution and the frequency. Since the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating along the z-axis, I think this has something to do with dipole radiation, maybe electric dipole or magnetic dipole. Wait, but the problem mentions an oscillating charge distribution, so more likely it's an electric dipole.

For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field or radiation zone should have a specific angular dependence. I recall that the far-field radiation for an electric dipole varies as (1/r), but the intensity pattern is more about angles.

Wait, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) for an electric dipole in the far field is proportional to (sinθ)^2, right? Because the dipole's radiation is maximum perpendicular to the dipole axis. So, θ is the angle from the z-axis. At θ=90 degrees, sinθ is 1, so maximum. At θ=0 or 180, sinθ is zero, so no radiation.

So, in this case, the maximum power A is radiated at θ=90 degrees. But the question is about θ=30 degrees. The function f depends on lambda and theta. So, f would be the power per unit solid angle at a given theta and lambda.

Wait, but what about how the power varies with theta? I think the power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta). So, the maximum occurs at theta=90 degrees, which would be sin^2(90) = 1. At theta=30 degrees, sin(30)=0.5, so sin^2 is 0.25. So the intensity at 30 degrees is a quarter of the maximum.

But wait, the question mentions "the fraction of A
