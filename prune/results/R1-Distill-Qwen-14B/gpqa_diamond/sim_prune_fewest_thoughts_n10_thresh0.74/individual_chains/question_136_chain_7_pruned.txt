Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that vector calculus can be tricky, but maybe I can break it down.

The problem says that the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, volume integral of divergence. Oh right, that's related to Gauss's Law! Or maybe the Divergence Theorem. Because the divergence theorem connects the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. But wait, no, the question is specifically about the volume integral, not the flux. Hmm.

Wait, no, the divergence theorem says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the field through the surface enclosing that volume. So, if I can find the flux, I can find the integral of the divergence.

But wait, maybe I should just compute the divergence first. Since the field is radial and depends only on r, the divergence in spherical coordinates might be straightforward.

In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that's purely radial and depends only on r is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f(r)). Right? Because for a vector field A with only the r-component, divergence is (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² A_r). So here, A_r is 1/r².

So let's compute that. f(r) = 1/r², so A_r = 1/r². Then, the divergence ∇·f would be (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let me compute that derivative.

r² * (1/r²) is just 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is (1/r²) * 0 = 0. Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin?

Wait, but wait a second. If the field is f(r) = 1/r² radial, then the divergence is zero except at r=0. Because at the origin, the function is not defined (since 1/0 is undefined). So the divergence is
