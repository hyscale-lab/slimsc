Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that there are two planets around a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's in a circular orbit with an impact parameter of 0.2. The star has a radius 1.5 times the Sun's. The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. Now, they're asking about a second planet which is biggerâ€”2.5 Earth radii. What's the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still allowing both transit and occultation events? And the options are given as A to D.

Hmm. I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and an occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so it's hidden from view. For both events to happen, the planets must be aligned in such a way that their orbital planes allow for these events. But wait, the problem says they share the same orbital plane, so that's taken care of.

Wait, the orbital period of the second planet can't be just any value. Oh, right! It's about the relative orbital periods. Because for both transit and occultation to occur, the second planet must be able to eclipse the first (occultation) and be eclipsed by the star (transit). But actually, wait, no. The transit of the second planet in front of the star would require that it passes in front, and the occultation would be when the star passes in front of the second planet, blocking it from view. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. Transit is when a planet passes in front of the star, blocking some light. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet is hidden. So for a planet to have both events, it must be that the planet can sometimes be in front (transit) and sometimes be behind (occultation). But in this case, the question is about a second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events. So, the second planet must transit the star, and the star must occult the second planet. So, the second planet must be in a position where it can sometimes be in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind it (occultation).

Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital periods? Oh, right, it's about the orbital periods of the two planets. For both events to occur, the two planets must be in orbital resonance, I think. Or maybe more specifically, the orbital periods must be such that their orbital periods are in a ratio that allows them to periodically align in the right way.

Wait, no. Maybe it's about the Hill sphere? Or more about the synodic period. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The first planet has a period of 3 days. The second has a
