Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. Alright, the question is about figuring out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are A to D, with some decimal numbers. 

Wait, the key info given is the periods of the eclipses and the radial velocity amplitudes. Oh right, I remember that in binary systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method is used to detect exoplanets, but here it's about binary stars. 

So, the problem gives the periods as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The periods between primary eclipses would relate to the orbital periods of the stars around each other. So the period (P) is the same for both components in a binary system because they orbit each other. 

Then, the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have RV variations of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10. I think the RV amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so a smaller velocity, right? Since velocity is inversely proportional to mass in a binary system. 

Wait, the formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude K comes into play here. I remember the formula: K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ), but wait, perhaps I'm mixing some terms. Alternatively, I've heard that the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the masses. So if one star has velocity K1 and the other K2, then M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because they have to balance each other's momentum. 

Yes, that's right. Since M1 * K1 = M2 * K2 (because momentum is conserved), so M1/M2 = K2/K1. So in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So K1=10, K2=5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2? Wait, but wait—each system has two stars. So the total mass for system_1 is M1 + M2 = (M2 * 0.5) + M2 = 1.5 M2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 

Wait, for system_1: let's say the two stars have masses M1 and M2. Their velocities are K1 and K2. So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1. So K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half of M2. Then the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2. 

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So K1=15, K2=10. So M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So the masses are M1 = (2/3) M2, and M2 is the other star. So the total mass for system_2 is (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2. 

Wait, but wait, that's not right. Because in system_2, the stars are M1' and M2', with K1' and K2'. So M1' = (K2' / K1') * M2'. So M1' = (1
