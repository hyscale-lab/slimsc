Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is important for properties like chirality and optical activity, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think carefully.

First, I should recall what C3h symmetry means. From what I remember, symmetry point groups are categorized based on the symmetry elements they possess. C3h is one of the point groups, right? I think the 'C' stands for a cyclic group, and the subscript '3' indicates that it has a three-fold rotation axis. The 'h' stands for a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, point groups can have different types of symmetry elements. Let me think: C3h is a type of group with a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, sometimes the h can refer to a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must have a three-fold rotational symmetry and a mirror plane that's horizontal relative to the axis.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me get this straight. The C3h group has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule must have a three-fold rotation symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees around the C3 axis, and there's a mirror plane that goes through the axis, reflecting the molecule into itself.

Now, looking at the options, I need to evaluate each molecule for its symmetry. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I'm not very familiar with all these molecules, but I'll try to visualize each structure.

Starting with option C, triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO, right? The structure is a boron atom bonded to three isopropyl groups. So each isopropyl is a (CH(CH3)2) group. The molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry around the boron, but with three identical substituents. So the boron is the center, and each isopropyl group is symmetric.

Wait, so the molecule is symmetric. Let's think about the symmetry. Each isopropyl group is the same, so the molecule should have a C3 axis, right? If you rotate 120 degrees around the boron atom, the molecule looks the same. But does it have a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis? Or maybe a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, the isopropyl groups are bulky. Each isopropyl has its own structure. The borate ion is trigonal planar. So the entire molecule is trigonal symmetric. So for C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but the mirror plane in C3h is a horizontal plane perpendicular to the C3 axis. So in this case, if the C3 axis is going through the boron, a horizontal plane would be perpendicular to that. So imagine looking along the C3 axis (from top down). The mirror plane would be horizontal, cutting through the boron. But wait, the boron is a flat trigonal planar structure. So in such a case, the mirror plane would be in the same plane as the boron's structure. Wait, no—maybe the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So for a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes would be in the same plane as the structure, but if you have a horizontal plane, perhaps it's a different matter.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C3 axis but lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, triisopropyl borate—each isopropyl group is symmetrical, but the arrangement around the boron is symmetric. So if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. But would it have a mirror plane? Let me think: if you take the boron as the center, and the mirror plane is in the same plane as the boron, perhaps. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each isopropyl group is arranged symmetrically, so the molecule might have a C3 axis but no mirror planes. Or perhaps it does have a mirror plane. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Now, moving on to option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, I think. It's a cage compound, with a structure like bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, but with an amine group. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane amine, perhaps. Wait, let me think again. Quinuclidine has a structure that's a norbornane derivative, but with a bridge. So it's a bicyclic molecule with a bridge. I remember that quinuclidine has a certain symmetry. For example, it has a C3 axis. Because the molecule is symmetric in a way that allows for a three-fold rotation.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bridged bicyclic amine. So it's a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. The molecule has a three-membered bridge. So if you look along the bridge, perhaps the structure has a three-fold rotational symmetry. So, if you rotate 120 degrees about that axis, the molecule looks the same. But does it have a mirror plane?

Wait, quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry. Let me try to visualize the structure. Quinuclidine has a bridged structure with two methyl groups attached to the bridgeheads. Wait, maybe it's better to think about its symmetry. I think quinuclidine has a C3h symmetry because it has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, no, maybe quinuclidine has a higher symmetry. Alternatively, it might be a C2h symmetry or something else. Hmm.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Trifuran derivatives are compounds with three furan rings connected in some way. The names are a bit complex, but benzo... suggests a benzene ring attached. Wait, the name is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So the molecule is a trifuran (like three furan rings connected) and a benzo ring attached at specific positions.

Trifuran derivatives can have various symmetries. Let me think about the structure of benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. The numbering suggests that the benzo ring is fused to the trifuran in a specific way. If the molecule has multiple rings, maybe it has a three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it's a planar structure with multiple substituents arranged symmetrically. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule doesn't have C3h symmetry.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a more complex structure. Triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic compound with three benzene rings. So triphenyleno fused to a trifuran. Hmm. So this molecule probably has a more complex structure, perhaps with a higher degree of symmetry. Maybe it's symmetric enough to have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about each option again.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. It has three identical isopropyl groups around a central boron. The molecule has a trigonal planar structure around the boron. So, a three-fold rotation axis (C3) would be present. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The mirror plane would have to be perpendicular to the C3 axis. Since the boron is planar, there might be a horizontal mirror plane through the boron. So the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. The isopropyl groups are in the same plane as the boron. So, if the C3 axis is through the boron, a horizontal plane (which is perpendicular to the axis) would be the same as the plane of the boron. Hmm, but that's where the boron is located. So, the mirror plane would be in that same plane, cutting through the boron. But the isopropyl groups are on the same side of that plane, so reflecting across it would leave the molecule unchanged. So yes, it would have a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis.

So triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry. So option C.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule. I think its structure is a bridge with a three-membered ring, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. But I remember that quinuclidine is a chiral molecule. If it's chiral, then it cannot have a plane of symmetry, which would be required for C3h symmetry. Because having a mirror plane would make it achiral. So if quinuclidine is chiral, it can't have C3h symmetry. So that would rule out option D.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Quinuclidine has a bridge, which might mean that it has a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. Quinuclidine's structure is such that it's a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane with an amine. The structure is symmetric in some way. Let me think. If you look along the three-fold axis (the bridge), perhaps rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But does it have a mirror plane? If it's symmetric across a plane, then it would have a mirror plane. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine is actually achiral, which would mean it has a mirror plane. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here, but I'll put that on hold.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The structure has a benzo ring connected to a trifuran. The trifuran part would have three furan rings connected. The numbering suggests that the benzo is fused in certain positions. But I'm not sure about the symmetry here. Benzo rings are symmetric, but when fused to another structure, the symmetry could be lower. Maybe this molecule has a C2 axis or something else, but I don't think it has a three-fold axis.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene part is a tricyclic aromatic structure, and it's connected to a trifuran. The structure might be more symmetric than the others. For example, each phenyl group might be arranged symmetrically around a central axis. But I'm not certain about the exact structure. It might have a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to tell. So perhaps I should focus on what I know better.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. As mentioned earlier, the molecule has a central boron with three identical isopropyl groups. So it definitely has a C3 axis. Now, does it have a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the C3 axis? Let's imagine looking down the C3 axis. The mirror plane would be perpendicular to this, say, the xy-plane if the C3 is along the z-axis. So the mirror plane would be the x-y plane. The molecule's structure is such that each isopropyl group is in the same plane as the boron. So the mirror plane would pass through the boron. Now, when you reflect across this plane, each isopropyl group would remain in place because they're all in the same plane and arranged symmetrically. So yes, the mirror plane exists, and the molecule has C3h symmetry.

So that would make option C correct.

Wait, but option D is quinuclidine. I thought earlier that quinuclidine is chiral, which would mean it doesn't have a mirror plane. So if it's chiral, it can't have C3h symmetry because that requires a mirror plane. So option D is out.

So the correct answer must be option C: triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but I should double-check. Some sources say that triisopropyl borane (which is similar to triisopropyl borate) has C3h symmetry. But wait, triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO-, but the structure is similar. So yes, it should have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, another point: the isopropyl groups are all in the same plane, making the molecule planar. So the mirror plane is in that plane, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So yes, it has C3h symmetry.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. C₃h symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the rotation axis.

### Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with a triphenylene fused to a trifuran. While it may have some symmetry due to the aromatic rings, the arrangement of the substituents does not clearly exhibit a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, it does not have C₃h symmetry.

### Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a benzo ring fused to a trifuran. The structure is planar, but the arrangement of the substituents does not support a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it does not exhibit C₃h symmetry.

### Option C: triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar around the boron atom, with a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C₃ axis, which passes through the boron atom. Since the molecule satisfies both the C₃ and σh symmetry requirements, it has C₃h symmetry.

### Option D: quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bridged structure. While it has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), it is a chiral molecule, meaning it lacks a plane of symmetry. Without a mirror plane (σh), it cannot exhibit C₃h symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, only **triisopropyl borate** satisfies the symmetry requirements for C₃h symmetry. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The other molecules either lack the necessary symmetry elements or are chiral, ruling them out.

**Answer: C**
