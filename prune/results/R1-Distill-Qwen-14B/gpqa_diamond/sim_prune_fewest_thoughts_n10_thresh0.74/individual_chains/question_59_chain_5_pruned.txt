Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out how much acid and base are present and see if they neutralize each other completely or if there's some excess.

The problem gives me three solutions:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

Wait, wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So each mole of Ba(OH)2 would provide two moles of OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

I think the first thing I should do is calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Let me calculate the moles for each solution.

Starting with CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity Ã— Volume. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Next, HCl: 0.2 M, 400 mL (0.4 L). Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M, 300 mL (0.3 L). Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-, the total OH- moles would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when mixing, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. So I need to consider the total H+ and OH-.

So let's sum up the H+ ions first. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely, but HCl is a strong acid and will dissociate completely. So the H+ from CH3COOH is 0.05 moles (since it's a weak acid, but maybe we can't just add it directly? Hmm, wait. No, I think the moles of H+ from CH3COOH are 0.05, and from HCl it's 0.08. So total H+ is 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. CH3COOH is a
