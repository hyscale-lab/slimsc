Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct products of these Michael addition reactions. Hmm, Michael addition... I remember it's a type of conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think about each reaction step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, using NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH. So, sodium ethoxide is a strong base, probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a diester with two ester groups. Ester groups are electron-withdrawing, making the alpha protons acidic. So, in the presence of a base like NaOEt, the malonate would lose a proton to form an enolate ion. The enolate would then attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so 3-(p-tolyl) would imply the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Acrylate is propenoate: CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl) would mean that the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon, which would be the same as the beta position, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C-O-p-tolyl, but that might not make sense. Wait, no, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the central carbon. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=C(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that would be if the substituent is on the alpha position. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the Michael acceptor is the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, so as to be in the beta position of the double bond. Wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, but that's outside the double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, no, if it's 3-(p-tolyl), then the substituent is on the third carbon, but that's beyond the double bond, which is between C1 and C2. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the double bond. Let me think again. The structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but the 3-position is where the p-tolyl is attached. So, maybe it's CH2=C(C6H4-4-
