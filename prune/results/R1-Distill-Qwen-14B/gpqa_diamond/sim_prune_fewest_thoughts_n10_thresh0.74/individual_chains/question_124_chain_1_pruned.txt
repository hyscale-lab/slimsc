Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So, the current situation is 1/3 reach the walls, and they want to find the factor that would make it about 2/3.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and whether they decay before that. Because if the particles are moving at a certain speed, they'll take a certain time to travel the radius of the detector. If their lifetime is such that they decay before reaching the wall, fewer will make it. So, the Lorentz factor affects both the time experienced by the particle (their proper time) and the time observed in the lab frame.

Wait, right, the proper time for the particle is shorter. So from the lab's perspective, the particle's lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The proper time (τ) for the particle is τ = t0, and the lab frame sees the particle's lifetime as gamma times tau. So the lifetime in the lab is gamma * τ.

The distance the particle travels is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The speed of the particle is v, which is related to the Lorentz factor gamma. Since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and for large gamma, v is approximately c. So, v is almost c, but not exactly. But maybe for an initial approach, we can approximate v as c since gamma is about 20, which isn't extremely high but it's relativistic enough that v is a significant fraction of c.

So, the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. Let's assume v ≈ c. Then t = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds? Let
