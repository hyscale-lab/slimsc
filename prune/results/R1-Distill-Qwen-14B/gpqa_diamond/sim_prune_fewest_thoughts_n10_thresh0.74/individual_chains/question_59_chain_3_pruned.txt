Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably find out the moles of each acid and base involved because that will determine whether the solution is acidic, basic, or neutral in the end. Mixing acids and bases can get a bit tricky because they might neutralize each other.

Let me list out the given data:

- Volume of CH3COOH solution: 500 mL (which is 0.5 L), concentration 0.1 M.
- Volume of HCl solution: 400 mL (0.4 L), concentration 0.2 M.
- Volume of Ba(OH)2 solution: 300 mL (0.3 L), concentration 0.3 M.

Wait, but wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So it'll dissociate completely in water. Similarly, HCl is a strong acid and will completely dissociate. Acetic acid is weak, so it won't dissociate completely.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each substance.

Moles are calculated by Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters).

So let's compute each:

For CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M, volume = 0.5 L.
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, volume = 0.4 L.
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M, volume = 0.3 L.
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. Barium hydroxide is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

So moles of OH^- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the other acids: both CH3COOH and HCl are acids. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll donate H+ ions completely. CH3COOH is weak, so it'll donate some H+ but not all.

But in the mixture, the strong acids and the strong base will react first, and then any remaining acid/base will determine the pH. So I should calculate the net H+ and OH- after their neutralization.

But wait, let me think. The HCl and Ba(OH)2 are strong acid and base, so they'll react completely. The acetic acid is a weak acid, so I'll have to handle that separately.

So first, let's consider the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2.

The
