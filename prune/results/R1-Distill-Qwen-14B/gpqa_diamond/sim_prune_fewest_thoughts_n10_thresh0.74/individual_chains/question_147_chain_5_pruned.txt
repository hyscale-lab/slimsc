Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the velocity of particle A in this annihilation process. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two positively charged particles and two negatively charged ones. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of particle A is given as 300 MeV/c². The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with velocities around 0.77c up to 0.96c. 

Wait, I remember that in annihilation processes, a lot of energy is converted into the rest mass of the products. But wait, since the products are moving, I guess I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum here.

The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. But wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², so the antiproton's rest energy is the same. Since it's moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate its kinetic energy as negligible compared to its rest energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the initial momentum is dominated by the moving antiproton and the proton is at rest. Or wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is
