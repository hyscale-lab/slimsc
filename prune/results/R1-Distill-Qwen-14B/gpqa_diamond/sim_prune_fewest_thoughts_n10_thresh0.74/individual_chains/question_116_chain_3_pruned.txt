Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get tricky, but let's take it slow.

The question says that Compound A has two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and another is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, so maybe something like -CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The triplet could be from a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like if you have (CH2)3CH3, but wait, that would be a triplet for the end CH3 because it's next to the middle CH2. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm, which is usually where methyl groups (CH3) attached to something else appear. So maybe a triplet for 6H suggests two methyl groups each with 3H. Because a triplet would imply splitting from two neighboring protons. So, perhaps each methyl is next to a CH2 group. So maybe two CH2CH3 groups? Or perhaps a cyclopropane? No, wait. Let me think of structures with 6H and 4H in NMR signals.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group. Because diethyl
