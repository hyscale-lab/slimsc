Okay, so I've got this NMR question to tackle. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm, so it's not like they're splitting each other because of coupling. 

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. So, same mass but two separate peaks. 

What's that about? Well, I remember that if the compound is a mixture of enantiomers, they would have the same mass and same retention time if the method isn't chiral. Wait, but LC-MS can sometimes separate enantiomers if the column is chiral. But in this case, the peaks are clearly defined and of equal intensity. If the column isn't chiral, they'd elute together, so that's not it.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. If it's a diastereomer, the NMR would split into different signals because the environment is different. But if it's a pair of enantiomers, the NMR would look the same for each proton because the environments are mirror images. So, enantiomers wouldn't cause duplicate peaks in NMR unless something else is going on.

Wait, wait. The question says that the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So the same proton is appearing twice. If the molecule is a diastereomer, the protons would split differently. But if it's a pair of enantiomers, the NMR would show a single peak for each proton because the environment is identical in each enantiomer. So why are there two peaks for the same alpha-proton?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound is a racemic mixture. But in that case, the NMR would show a single peak because the alpha-protons are in identical environments. So that doesn't fit. Unless... Wait, maybe the diastereomer has different environments. So if it's a diastereomer mixture, the alpha-proton would split into different peaks. But why would two peaks with same shifts?

Wait, the shifts are similar but not the same. So the two peaks are
