Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have Br atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C... Hmm. KOH is a strong base. So I think this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with strong bases, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a 1,3-dihalide, not 1,2. Oh, but wait—adamantane has a structure where the positions 1 and 3 are adjacent in a certain way? Or maybe it's a bridged structure. Wait, no. I think in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others in a diamond-like structure. So 1 and 3 might be across a ring? Hmm. Wait, maybe it's more about the positions on the adamantane skeleton. Anyway, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, I think it's an E2 elimination. But wait, E2 requires anti-periplanar arrangement. So if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in a way that allows for elimination, then we'll get an alkene.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a geminal dihalide? No, because that would be same carbon. No, it's 1 and 3, so two different carbons. Oh wait, maybe it's a vicinal situation if the structure allows. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substitution that allows for elimination to form a double bond. So the product after KOH would be an adamantyl diene or something similar. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a ketone. Wait, no, KOH is a base, not a oxidizing agent. Unless elimination isn't possible, then maybe it would do something else. Hmm.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), then 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. That IR peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. Because 1720 is around where ketones and aldehydes absorb. So, wait—maybe elimination didn't happen, but instead, it's a substitution. But how?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the dibromide is treated with a strong base and undergoes a double elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, for that, I think it's the Corey-Fuchs reaction or some kind of elimination to form a ketone. Oh wait! Another reaction: When a geminal dihalide (X2C-) is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can eliminate to form a carbonyl group. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, not geminal. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide that undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. But in that case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe the first step isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. KOH is a strong base, so it can cause an SN2 reaction. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane—would that undergo SN2? Probably not, because adamantane is a very rigid structure with high strain for SN2. Unless it's a bridgehead substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and upon treatment with KOH, it loses HBr twice, leading to the formation of a ketone. But that would require the two Brs to be on adjacent carbons (vicinal), but I'm not sure about the structure.

Wait, another thought: When 1,2-dihaloalkanes are treated with a base, they eliminate to form alkenes. But if it's 1,3-dihalo, perhaps it's a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is such that when both Brs leave, a carbonyl is formed. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and each is removed, forming a double bond, but wait, that's elimination. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead and elimination leads to formation of a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's around where CH2 groups adjacent to electronegative atoms would show up. For example, CH2O groups. Wait, but 4.79 is more like a CH2 next to oxygen, maybe as in an ether or an alcohol. But wait, if the product is a ketone, then the 4.79 peak doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, because epoxide protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 that's adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an ether group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) must be from the adamantane structure, perhaps as CH2 groups. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group. Wait, but how does that fit with the IR carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol. But then the IR wouldn't have a strong carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. Let me think: If the product is a ketone, then in the NMR, the ketone's neighboring groups would be CH2 groups. Wait, but the 4.79 ppm peak is 2H, which could be adjacent to the carbonyl. So maybe it's a structure where there's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group. Like CH2-CO-R. But how would that form?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. Let me think: For each Br, elimination could produce HBr, and the two eliminations could lead to a double bond, but wait, that would form an alkene, not a ketone. Unless the elimination leads to a conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the product is an epoxide? No, I don't think so, because the IR wouldn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone? But then the IR would show a strong peak around 1720, but the NMR would have different features. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone.

Hmm. Let me think again. Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but for a bridged structure, maybe the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but adamantane's structure doesn't have bridgehead double bonds because of Bredt's rule, which says that bridgehead double bonds are not stable unless the bridge is large enough, like in norbornene. So maybe the elimination doesn't form a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution, but in such a rigid structure, maybe it's more likely to eliminate. But the product has a carbonyl group, which suggests elimination. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and upon elimination, both Br leave, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. So, each Br is on a bridgehead, and when they leave, the carbons they were on each lose a bond, forming a double bond between them and forming a ketone? Wait, maybe that's stretching it.

Wait, let me think about the product. If the product after KOH is a ketone, then 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules and form a carbonyl group. So maybe each Br is adjacent to a carbonyl, but that seems a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanone. Let me visualize the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. If a carbonyl group is at position 1, then perhaps the structure is such that upon elimination, a ketone is formed.

But how does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Maybe the mechanism is a double dehydrohalogenation, where each Br is removed with elimination, leading to a carbonyl. So maybe the product is an adamantane ring with a ketone group. Let's say that's product 1.

So product 1 is 1-adamantanone, perhaps. Then, when it's heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, product 2 is formed. What reaction would that be? Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But adamantane is a saturated structure, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't apply. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement? Or some kind of elimination or acylation.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is a ketone, maybe the next step is a conjugate addition or some kind of enol formation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: When a ketone is heated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, maybe it undergoes some kind of enolization or rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a aldol condensation, but that usually requires a base. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product 2 is a dienophile. Or maybe it's a cyclopropane formation. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second step is forming an enol ether or something. Or maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement. Wait, the pinacol rearrangement occurs when a 1,2-diol is treated with acid to form a carbonyl. But product 1 is a ketone, not a diol. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a dienone, and product 2 is the dienol. But I'm not certain.

Moving on, product 2 is then subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 3 would be the result of ozonolysis of product 2.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But what would the structure look like, and what would the NMR show?

Wait, let me try to piece this together. So product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1-adamantanone. Then, product 2 is formed when this ketone is heated with Al isopropoxide. What reaction would that be? Maybe the ketone undergoes some kind of elimination, perhaps forming an enone system or a conjugated diene.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is not a ketone. Let me rethink the first step. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH gives a product with an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the starting material is a dihalide, and upon treatment with KOH, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice, eliminating two HBr and forming a carbonyl group. So, the product would be 1,3-diketone? But that doesn't seem right because adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane structure, so adding two ketones might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination from each leads to a single ketone. So, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the carbons they were on form a carbonyl group. So, in the adamantane structure, the two bridgehead carbons each lose Br and form a carbonyl group. So, the product would have a single ketone in the structure. Let's say that's product 1.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Wait, perhaps this is for a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but adamantane is fully saturated. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement. Wait, the Claisen rearrangement is for allyl vinyl ethers to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But I don't see how product 1 would fit that.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a strained ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it forms an enol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether. But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think about product 2. Since the next step is ozonolysis, product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds. So, product 2 must have a double bond, which would come from product 1 via some reaction with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes an elimination to form a double bond. So, for example, if product 1 is a ketone, and adjacent to it are some hydrogen atoms that can be removed, leading to the formation of an alkene in product 2. So, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes a ring-opening to form an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone again. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and product 2 is a more strained structure with a double bond, allowing ozonolysis.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on product 2. Let me try another approach. After ozonolysis, product 3 is formed. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. So, the structure of product 2 must have a double bond. Let's say product 2 has a double bond somewhere in the adamantane structure.

If product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, looking at the NMR of product 3, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would be the ones attached to the carbonyl groups, perhaps, or near them.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the products are typically carbonyl compounds. So, for example, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyls. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. But in the context of adamantane, which is a very rigid structure, the cleavage would result in specific fragments.

Wait, but perhaps the ozonolysis is under specific conditions. Ozone at -78°C is a typical condition for ozonolysis that leads to reductive workup, sometimes leading to formation of aldehydes or ketones without over-oxidizing. Then, the workup with dimethyl sulfide (which is a mild reductant) would break the ozonides into carbonyl compounds.

So, in product 3, we'd have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were in product 2.

Now, let's think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is a bicyclic diene, perhaps a norbornene derivative within the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have two ketone groups in the structure.

But then, what's the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H? Those would likely be the ones adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in an adamantane structure, the carbons are highly symmetrical. So, if the ozonolysis cleaves a bridge, perhaps the resulting carbonyl groups are in positions that cause certain coupling patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis doesn't break the ring but adds groups. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling pattern in the NMR. The question asks about the most deshielded H, which would be near electronegative groups, like oxygen. So, perhaps these are protons adjacent to carbonyl groups.

In the NMR, the most deshielded (downfield) protons would be attached to carbons next to carbonyls. Those protons would couple with neighboring protons. Let's say each of these Hs is adjacent to two equivalent Hs. Then, what would the coupling pattern be?

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two different sets of Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, another angle: If the most deshielded H is adjacent to a CH2 group, which itself is adjacent to a carbonyl, then the H would couple with the two Hs on the CH2. That would give a triplet, because each H on the CH2 has one neighbor (so n=1, leading to a triplet).

Alternatively, if the H is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs, that could lead to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but the question specifies the coupling pattern, not the number of peaks. So, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. In that case, the Hs would be split by neighboring Hs.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid with IR 1720 cm-1). So, product 1 has a carbonyl.

2. Product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2.

3. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis → product 3.

Product 3's NMR: what's the coupling of the most deshielded H (excluding those exchanging with solvent)?

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Hmm.

Maybe product 1 is 1-adamantanone. Then, product 2 would be an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. But the IR doesn't show a peak for epoxide (around 1250 cm-1 for C-O-C). The IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone.

Then, product 2 is formed by treating the ketone with Al isopropoxide. What reaction is that? Maybe the ketone undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. For example, using a Lewis acid to facilitate the removal of a proton adjacent to the carbonyl, leading to an enol, which then tautomerizes back to the ketone. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement, but that requires an allyl vinyl ether.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bridged bicyclic ketone, and product 2 is an olefin formed by elimination. So, product 2 would have a double bond in the bridge. Then, ozonolysis would break that double bond.

So, let's imagine product 2 is a bridged bicyclic diene. Ozonolysis would cleave the bridge, forming two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have two ketones in the structure.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Let's say each of these Hs is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each of these Hs would be split by coupling with two neighboring Hs. So, each H would be a triplet because each is next to a CH2 (two Hs).

Wait, but if each H is next to a CH2 group, then each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But if there are other couplings, like if the CH2 is next to another CH2, that could complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, but that's less likely given the NMR data in product 1.

Wait, in product 1, the NMR shows a 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a CH2 next to an oxygen, like in an ether, but product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol, but the IR doesn't support that. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, like in an enol structure. But that would imply some conjugation.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone, but that seems unlikely given the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is an epoxide, but I'm not seeing how the IR would fit.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on what product 1 and 2 look like. Let me try a different approach: think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond, and product 3 will have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, looking at the options, the coupling pattern could be a triplet if each H is next to two Hs. For example, if a CH2 is next to a carbonyl, and the H's on the CH2 are next to another CH2 group, but that might not directly cause a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if a proton is coupled with two different sets of protons, each with a different coupling constant, the splitting could be more complex. For example, a triplet of triplets would arise if a proton is split by two different adjacent groups, each with two protons. So, if a H is next to a CH2 (coupling as a triplet) and also next to another CH2 with a different coupling constant, it could lead to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but product 3's structure after ozonolysis would have two carbonyl groups. So, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to one of these carbonyls. Let's say the structure after ozonolysis is two ketones connected in some way. Then, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl groups may be part of a CH2 group.

If each of those CH2 groups is next to another CH2, then each H would be split by two neighboring Hs, creating a triplet. But if each H is also split by another set of Hs (like from a neighboring group), the pattern might become more complex.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's next to two other CH2 groups. So, each H would couple with two Hs from each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe the H is in a position where it's coupled with two different sets of protons, each giving a triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm. Another thought: in the ozonolysis product, the protons near the carbonyl might be in a conjugated system, leading to coupling with more distant protons. But that's more about spin-spin coupling over longer distances, which can lead to more complex splitting.

In the case of product 3, if the carbonyl groups are in a structure that leaves the adjacent CH2 groups each coupled with two different sets of nearby Hs, then the splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

So, considering all this, perhaps the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, resulting in a light yellow solid product 1.  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group.  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom (likely oxygen). The other peaks (2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H and 1.94 ppm for 2H) are consistent with the adamantane framework.  
   - Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is identified as 1-adamantanone, where two HBr molecules are eliminated, forming a ketone.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 (1-adamantanone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid.  
   - This likely facilitates an elimination reaction, forming a double bond in the structure. The resulting product 2 is a bicyclic compound with a double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a workup with dimethyl sulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains two carbonyl groups.  

4. **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group that is coupled with two sets of neighboring hydrogens. The coupling pattern arises from interactions with two distinct groups of protons, leading to a triplet of triplets.  

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B
