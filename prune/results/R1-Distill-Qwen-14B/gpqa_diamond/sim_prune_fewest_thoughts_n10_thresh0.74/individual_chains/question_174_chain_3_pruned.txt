Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy differences between relativistic and classical calculations. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, I need to find the difference between the correct T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, okay, first, I need to figure out the rest masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. Given that one is twice the other, so m1 = 2*m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99*M.

Wait wait, wait. The sum is 99% of the initial mass M? But wait, in reality, during fission, some mass is converted into energy, but the problem says the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So, perhaps that 1% is the mass converted into kinetic energy or other forms, but I'm not sure yet.

So, let's do the math. Let me assign m1 = 2m2. Then m1 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99*M → m2 = (0.99*M)/3 ≈ 0.33M. So m1 would be 0.66M, and m2 is 0.33M.

Wait, but wait. The initial nucleus is M. After fission, the two fragments have rest masses summing to 0.99M, so the rest mass of the two fragments is less than M. So, the mass difference (0.01 M) must be converted into kinetic energy and other things like binding energy. But in the context of this problem, perhaps the kinetic energy is what we're focusing on.

But the problem mentions the rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV. So, the rest mass energy Mc² is 300 GeV. So, M = 300 GeV/c².

Wait, but in the problem, the rest masses of the two
