Okay, so I've got this question about the color absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, I think I remember something about conjugated pi systems and their relation to light absorption. Let me think this through.

The question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system and emits light at 2.3393 eV. Wait, when a compound emits light, that's fluorescence maybe? But the question is about the absorbed color, right? Oh wait, no, wait. The emitted light's energy is less than the absorbed, I think. Because when a molecule absorbs higher energy and then emits lower, that's fluorescence. So the energy of the emitted light is lower than the absorbed.

So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy must be higher than that. But wait, what's the relationship between energy and wavelength? Oh right, E = hc/λ. So higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength.

The visible spectrum is roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Let me calculate the wavelength for 2.3393 eV. 

Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But wait, eV to joules conversion: 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So 2.3393 eV would be 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J.

Let me compute that: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = approximately 3.746e-19 J.

Then E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
E = 3.746e-19 J

λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.746e-19)
Let me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divide by denominator: 1.9878e-25 / 3.746e-19 ≈ 5.31e-7 m, which is 531 nm. Wait, 531 nm is in the green part. Because green is around 500-570 nm.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the color absorbed. Oh no no, wait. The compound emits light at 2.3393 eV (531 nm, green), but what color is absorbed? So absorption is when the molecule goes from a lower energy state to a higher one. So the energy absorbed would be higher than emitted, but wait, the energy difference between the ground state and excited state is the energy absorbed, which is higher than the emitted because the emission is the drop from a higher to a lower state.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it returns to the ground state, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed photon because some energy is lost as heat or whatever.

So if the emission energy is 2.3393 eV (531 nm, green), the absorption must be at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So in the visible spectrum, that would be blue (around 450-495 nm) or violet (400-450 nm). But wait, the emission is green, so the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 531 nm.

So what's the visible color corresponding to higher energy than 2.3393 eV? Let's compute the wavelength for 2.3393 eV and then see what's the absorbed.

Wait, wait. Maybe I should think about it another way. The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. The energy absorbed is higher than that. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy, shorter wavelength.

If the emitted is 531 nm (green), the absorption is at a shorter wavelength than that. So what color would that be? Let's see: 531 nm is green. Shorter wavelengths than that are blue, then violet.

Wait, but the options are A) Red (longer wavelength), B) Violet (shorter), C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So if the emission is green, the absorption must be at a higher energy, so the absorbed photon is blue or violet.

But wait, what's the energy of the absorbed photon? Let me think. Suppose the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy than 2.3393 eV, so the wavelength is shorter than 531 nm.

So the absorbed photon's wavelength is less than 531 nm. So possible colors are blue (~450-500), or violet (~400-450). So the absorbed color is in the blue or violet range.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye absorbs a certain color, which is complementary to the color it emits. Because when a substance emits light, it's because it's returning to a lower energy state, so the emitted color is the one we see. But the absorbed color is what the dye takes in.

Wait, no, maybe I got it wrong. Wait, when a dye absorbs light, it's because it's absorbing a certain wavelength, so the color we see is the complementary color. For example, if a dye absorbs blue, it would transmit or emit red, perhaps. Or maybe not, because in fluorescence, it's a different process.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's clarify: The dye emits light at 2.3393 eV (531 nm, green). So when the dye is excited, it emits green. But the question is about the color absorbed by the compound. So the compound must have absorbed a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV, which means the wavelength is shorter than 531 nm. So the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet range.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. So what's the absorbed color? The question is about the color of light absorbed. Wait, the emitted color is green, but the absorbed light is the one that excites the molecule. So the absorbed color is in the higher energy range, so the compound absorbs either blue or violet.

But how do I determine which one?

Wait, extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps. Wait, the more conjugated the pi system, the lower the energy of the absorbed photon. Hmm, because with conjugation, the HOMO-LUMO gap decreases. So higher conjugation leads to lower energy absorption? Or higher?

Wait, no, more conjugation leads to longer wavelength (lower energy) absorption. Because the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is smaller with longer conjugation. So, for example, ethylene (small conjugation) absorbs at higher energy (shorter wavelength, maybe UV), while something like beta-carotene absorbs in the visible (orange or red).

Wait, but in this case, the emission is 2.3393 eV (green). So the energy difference between ground and excited state is the same as the emitted photon? Or not? Hmm, maybe not exactly because some energy is lost as heat, but perhaps in this question, it's assumed that the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference (ΔE) between the ground state and excited state is the same as the emitted photon's energy. So if the molecule absorbs a photon of energy ΔE, it emits a photon of energy less than ΔE. But wait, in fluorescence, the emitted photon is lower energy than the absorbed one. So the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, emits a lower energy photon, so the energy absorbed is higher than emitted.

So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy must be higher. So, wavelength absorbed is shorter than 531 nm (green). So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But the options are B) Violet and C) Blue. So which one?

Wait, let me find the exact wavelength for 2.3393 eV.

Calculating:

E (eV) = 1240 / λ (nm)

So for E = 2.3393 eV,

λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 531 nm (as I calculated earlier).

So 531 nm is green. The absorbed photon has higher energy, so shorter wavelength. Let's say the molecule absorbs at, say, 450 nm, which is blue, or 400 nm, which is violet.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So the compound must absorb either blue or violet.

Wait, but the question says the compound emits green upon excitation, which suggests that the absorbed light is of higher energy (blue or violet), causing the molecule to emit green.

So the absorbed light is the higher energy one, which is either blue or violet.

But looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

Which one is correct? How do I figure this out.

Wait, another angle. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy absorbed is higher. Let me think of the possible energies of the options.

What is the energy corresponding to violet? Let's calculate.

Violet is around 400-450 nm. Let's take 425 nm as an example.

E = 1240 / 425 ≈ 2.918 eV.

Similarly, blue is around 450 nm.

E =1240 /450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

So the absorbed energy must be higher than 2.3393 eV, so 2.756 or 2.918 eV.

Which of the options' colors have energy higher than 2.3393 eV?

So the absorbed color must be either violet (400-450, 2.756-3.1 eV) or blue (450 nm, about 2.756 eV).

Wait, but the options are A)Red (620-700 nm), B) Violet (400-450), C) Blue(450-495), D) Yellow (570-590 approx).

Wait, the emitted is green (around 531 nm), which is around 2.339 eV.

So the absorbed energy must be higher. So if the options are about the color absorbed, which color has higher energy than 2.339 eV.

So the options are:

A) Red: ~ 1.77 eV (since 1240/700 ≈1.77)

B) Violet: 1240/400=3.1 eV, 1240/450≈2.756 eV.

C) Blue: 1240/450≈2.756 eV, 1240/495≈2.5 eV.

D) Yellow: 1240/570≈2.175 eV, 1240/590≈2.102 eV.

So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.339 eV. So looking at the options, the colors that have E>2.339 eV are:

B) Violet (2.756-3.1 eV)

C) Blue (2.1-2.75 eV? Wait, no. Wait, 495 nm is blue, which is E=1240/495≈2.5 eV.

So blue's E is up to about 2.5 eV.

So 2.339 eV is the emission. So the absorbed energy must be higher than 2.339 eV.

Which options have E>2.339?

B) Violet: 2.756-3.1 eV.

C) Blue: depends, but the lower end of blue is around 450 nm (E=2.756 eV), but the higher end (like 495 nm) would be about 2.5 eV. Wait no, 495 nm is about 2.5 eV.

Wait, 2.5 eV is higher than 2.339 eV. So for blue at 495 nm, E=2.5 eV. So it's higher than 2.339.

So blue (option C) would have an energy of about 2.5 eV, which is higher than 2.339, so that's possible.

Wait, but violet is higher than blue in energy, so if the molecule has a conjugated system that absorbs at blue or violet?

But wait, the question says "extensively conjugated pi-electrons". Extensive conjugation typically leads to a bathochromic shift, meaning longer wavelength (lower energy) absorption.

So if the conjugation is extensive, the molecule absorbs at a longer wavelength (lower energy). Hmm, that suggests the absorption maximum is shifted to a longer wavelength (lower energy) compared to less conjugated systems.

Wait, but in this case, the emission is 2.339 eV (531 nm, green). So the absorption must be at a higher energy, which suggests a shorter wavelength, but extensive conjugation would imply lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between absorption and emission. Let me think again.

In conjugated systems, increasing the number of conjugated double bonds (extensive conjugation) decreases the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO, which means the molecule absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) photons. So the absorption maximum shifts to the red end (higher wavelength) as conjugation increases.

Wait, but in this case, the emission is in green. So if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption would be in the longer wavelength (lower energy) part, perhaps even into the red. But that would mean the emitted photon is higher in energy than the absorbed, which doesn't make sense because the emitted photon is usually lower in energy.

Wait, no, the energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed one. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, so shorter wavelength.

But if the compound has extensive conjugation, it absorbs at lower energies, longer wavelengths. But that would mean that the absorbed photon is in the visible range (like red or orange), but that would make the emitted photon even lower, which would be in IR, but that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the example of beta-carotene. It's a conjugated system with extensive pi bonds, and it absorbs in the visible (orange) and emits in the blue, maybe? Not sure. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, another approach. If the emitted photon is at 2.3393 eV (531 nm, green), then the energy difference between the ground state and excited state is 2.3393 eV. So the molecule absorbed a photon of higher energy, say 2.756 eV (440 nm, blue) or 3.1 eV (400 nm, violet), which would then drop to a state that emits green.

So the absorbed photon is either violet or blue. Now, considering that the molecule has an extensively conjugated system, which usually absorbs at longer wavelengths (lower energy), so which color is higher in energy (lower wavelength) but still in the visible.

Wait, extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So if the molecule's absorption is in the blue or violet, then it's a less conjugated system. Wait, no, that's not right. Extensive conjugation implies larger pi systems, which tend to absorb at longer wavelengths.

But wait, I'm confused. Let me try to think of some examples. For instance, benzene has a conjugated pi system and absorbs around 180 nm (UV), which is higher energy (shorter wavelength). Anthracene, with more conjugated rings, absorbs at longer wavelengths (like around 250 nm, still UV). But when you get to carotenes, they absorb in the visible range (around 500 nm).

Wait, this suggests that more conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So if a molecule has many conjugated double bonds, it absorbs at longer wavelengths.

So, if this dye has an extensively conjugated system, it would absorb at a longer wavelength, but that would be lower energy. But the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (531 nm), green. So if the absorption is in a longer wavelength (lower energy), but the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is higher than the absorption? That can't be.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me start over.

In fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon (higher energy), then emits a photon of lower energy. So the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed.

So, if the molecule emits at 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must have higher energy (lower wavelength, blue or violet). But if the molecule has extensive conjugation, it typically absorbs at longer wavelengths (lower energy). That's a contradiction because if the absorption is at longer wavelength (lower energy), then the emitted photon would have even lower energy (since emission is lower than absorption), which would be in the IR, which is not the case here.

So maybe I'm thinking this wrong. Perhaps the molecule's absorption is at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) when it's conjugated? That doesn't make sense because I thought conjugation leads to lower energy absorption.

Wait, perhaps the photon emitted is due to a different transition, not the same as the one absorbed. For example, the molecule could absorb a photon of higher energy, get into a higher excited state, then emit a photon of lower energy from that state to a lower excited state. So the emission photon's energy is lower than the absorbed one, but not necessarily the same as the HOMO-LUMO gap.

But I'm not sure. This is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. The emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed photon must have higher energy. That would be blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. Which one has higher energy than 2.339 eV?

As I calculated earlier, 440 nm (blue) is about 2.756 eV, which is higher than 2.339. Similarly, violet at 400 nm is 3.1 eV.

So both B and C options have higher energy than 2.339 eV. So the question is, which color is correct.

But the question states that the compound has an extensively conjugated pi system. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy absorption (longer wavelength). So if the molecule has a lot of conjugation, the absorption should be at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than in less conjugated systems. But wait, in this case, the emission is at 531 nm (green, 2.339 eV). So the absorption must be at a shorter wavelength (higher energy), which would be blue or violet.

But that's conflicting with the idea that extensive conjugation leads to lower energy absorption. So that suggests that the absorption is in the visible range, maybe blue or violet.

Wait, but perhaps the question is referring to the color we see. If the molecule is a dye, the color we see is the complementary color of the absorbed. So if it absorbs blue, it reflects the complement, which is orange. But wait, that's for color mixing. But in fluorescence, the emitted light is what we see.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule emits green, so it's absorbing a higher energy photon, which is either blue or violet. So the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

But the question is, which one is correct? Let's think about the energy.

If the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (531 nm, green), the energy difference between the states is 2.3393 eV.

But the absorbed photon must supply more energy than that. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 531 nm.

So the absorbed color is either blue or violet. But which one?

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the molecule absorbs blue, the option is C, and if it absorbs violet, option B.

But how to choose between them?

Hmm, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is in the blue region. Let me think: the maximum emission for a molecule that's conjugated is often in the green or red, but the absorption is usually in the UV for small conjugated systems, but for large, it's in the visible.

Wait, wait, an example: beta-carotene is a conjugated molecule. It absorbs in the blue-green region (around 450 nm) and emits in the red (around 620 nm). So in that case, the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

Wait, no, beta-carotene's absorption is around 450 nm (blue region), but the emission is in the red (around 620 nm?), which is lower energy. Wait, that can't be right because the emitted should be lower in energy than the absorbed. So maybe I'm getting the absorption and emission mixed up.

Wait, no, in fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon (higher energy) and then emits a lower energy photon. So beta-carotene absorbs in the blue and emits in the red. Because blue has higher energy than red.

So for beta-carotene, absorbed is blue, emitted is red. Then, in the question, the emitted is green. So the absorbed would be blue or violet.

Wait, but in the question, the emitted is green, which is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed must be higher than that. So blue (2.756 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

So which one is more likely for an extensively conjugated system?

Wait, beta-carotene has extensive conjugation. Its absorption is around 450 nm (blue), and emission is red. So the absorption is in the blue, which is higher energy than the emission.

So in our case, the emission is green (2.3393 eV), so the absorption must be higher, which would be blue (2.756 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

But beta-carotene's absorption is in the blue, so maybe the answer is blue.

Wait, but if the molecule has even more extensive conjugation, would it absorb in the violet? Or does it stop at blue?

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps for this question, the correct answer is blue or violet, but considering that extensive conjugation would lead to a lower energy absorption than less conjugated systems. Wait, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to know that the complementary color of the emitted is the absorbed. But no, that's not correct because in fluorescence, the emitted color is not the complementary. The emitted color is determined by the energy difference between states, which is lower than the absorbed.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted light is the same color as the absorbed, but that can't be right because the energy is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the colors in terms of their eV values.

Emission: 2.3393 eV → 531 nm → green.

Absorption: higher than 2.3393 eV → shorter wavelength (blue or violet).

So the color absorbed must be either blue or violet.

The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

So which one is correct?

I think the correct answer is B) Violet because extensive conjugation leads to lower energy absorption, but wait, that would mean the absorption is at longer wavelengths, but in this case, the absorption is at higher energy.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe the correct answer is B) Violet or C) Blue, but I can't decide. Wait, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the energy of the absorbed photon is higher. Let's pick the highest possible from the options.

Option B (violet) is 3.1 eV, which is higher than 2.3393, and option C (blue) is 2.756 eV, which is also higher.

If the conjugated system is extensive, the absorption would be at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than less conjugated systems. So maybe the absorption is at a longer wavelength than, say, benzene, which absorbs at 180 nm (UV). Extensive conjugation would lead to absorption in the visible, like 450 nm (blue) or 400 nm (violet).

But without more specific info, perhaps the answer is B) Violet because the energy 2.3393 is on the green side, so the absorbed would be on the blue or violet side. The question says the compound emits light when excited, which suggests that the absorbed photon is higher in energy.

Wait, perhaps the color absorbed is blue. Because 2.756 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon is blue.

Wait, but another example: if the emitted is green, the absorbed could be blue. So the correct answer might be C) Blue.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO determines the absorption. Perhaps a more conjugated system has a smaller energy gap, implying a lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. But if the emission is in green, which is higher energy than red but lower than blue, maybe the absorption is blue or violet.

Another approach: The energy between ground state and first excited state is the energy of the emitted photon. But wait, no, the emitted photon is from a higher energy state to a lower one. The absorbed photon would have to supply the energy to reach that higher state.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the two states. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than that.

But I'm stuck. Maybe I should just pick the answer based on the options.

The options are:

A) Red (1.77 eV) → lower than 2.339 → can't be.

B) Violet (3.1 eV) → higher.

C) Blue (2.756 eV) → higher.

D) Yellow (2.175 eV) → lower.

So the correct answer must be either B or C.

The question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi system. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So if the dye has a lot of conjugation, it would absorb at longer wavelengths. But in this case, the absorption is at a shorter wavelength (higher energy) since the emitted is 2.3393. Hmm, but that would suggest that the conjugation isn't that extensive. But the question states it's extensively conjugated.

I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should just go with the calculation. The emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed must be higher. The options with higher are B and C.

But the question is what color is absorbed. So the compound absorbs either violet or blue.

If the conjugated system is extensive, the absorption is at a longer wavelength than a less conjugated system. So if another compound with less conjugation would absorb at, say, 400 nm (violet), the more conjugated one would absorb at 450 nm (blue), a longer wavelength.

So with extensive conjugation, the absorption shifts to the blue region. So the color absorbed is blue. So the correct answer is C) Blue.


The question involves determining the color of light absorbed by a textile dye with an extensively conjugated pi-electron system, given that it emits light at an energy of 2.3393 eV (531 nm, green). To solve this, we analyze the relationship between energy and wavelength, as well as the implications of conjugation on absorption.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy and Wavelength Relationship**:  
   The energy of light is inversely proportional to its wavelength, as described by the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelengths, and lower energy corresponds to longer wavelengths.

2. **Emission and Absorption**:  
   In fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is lower than the energy of the absorbed photon. This means the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

3. **Emission Energy**:  
   The emitted photon energy is 2.3393 eV, corresponding to a wavelength of approximately 531 nm (green). Therefore, the absorbed photon must have an energy greater than 2.3393 eV, meaning its wavelength is shorter than 531 nm.

4. **Visible Spectrum and Options**:  
   - Red (700–620 nm): Energy ≈ 1.65–1.98 eV (too low, cannot be absorbed).  
   - Violet (450–400 nm): Energy ≈ 2.756–3.10 eV (higher than 2.3393 eV).  
   - Blue (495–450 nm): Energy ≈ 2.50–2.756 eV (higher than 2.3393 eV).  
   - Yellow (590–570 nm): Energy ≈ 2.10–2.175 eV (too low, cannot be absorbed).  

   Thus, the absorbed photon must correspond to either violet or blue.

5. **Conjugation and Absorption Wavelength**:  
   Extensive conjugation in a molecule typically leads to a bathochromic shift, meaning the absorption maximum shifts to longer wavelengths (lower energy). However, in this case, the emission is in the green region (531 nm), and the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength). This suggests that the absorption occurs in the blue or violet range.

6. **Final Selection**:  
   Between violet (400–450 nm) and blue (450–495 nm), both are possible candidates. However, extensive conjugation often results in absorption at slightly longer wavelengths (closer to blue). Therefore, the absorbed photon is most likely blue (450–495 nm).

### Conclusion:
The color of light absorbed by the organic compound is **blue**.

Answer: C
