Okay, so I've got this question about a mouse model and a protein called GADD45G. The person is trying to create a transgenic mouse where this protein is overexpressed inducibly. Hmm, their goal is to see if this protein plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using some techniques like affinity purification and stuff. 

Wait, the problem is that when they tried to overexpress the protein, it didn't work. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with a plasmid, but the protein isn't being expressed as expected. So they're checking why.

Looking at the construct's plus strand sequence, I need to find the issue. Let's see, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's TAC, which is Tyrosine. But wait, the next codon is CCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC... I'm trying to think what the sequence might have wrong.

The user modified the gene to add the hemagglutinin sequence at the N-terminus. So the construct is supposed to express a fusion protein with HA epitope. But maybe something went wrong in the modification.

Let me think about the options. 

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would cause the epitope to not work, but would it prevent expression? Maybe, but the question is about overexpression not happening. So maybe the protein isn't made at all. Alternatively, a mutation in HA might not affect expression but just affinity purification. But the main issue is the protein isn't overexpressed, so perhaps this isn't the reason.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the wrong place. Let me check the sequence for any early stop codons. The reading frame starts at ATG. Let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Scanning through: the first few codons are ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, Gtt, cca, etc. Wait, at the end, I see TGA somewhere. Let me see. Looking... let's go step by step.

The sequence: 5' ... TGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'

Looking towards the end, the last part is ...CAGC TGA ... Wait, maybe let's see. Let me look for TGA or TAA or TAG.

Looking for TGA: Let's see, in the last part, we have ...CGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

So, looking at the end, it's ...CAGC TGA. Wait, that's the last part of the sequence. So the last codons before the TGA are CAG C TGA. Wait, that's CAG (which is Gln), then TGA. TGA is a stop codon. So in the sequence, the TGA is after the CAG. So the reading frame is ATG ... and then there's a TGA later on, so the ribosome would terminate early. Oh wait, but when does it come? Let me count the letters.

The entire ORF is from ATG to TGA, but I need to see how long the ORF is. If the TGA is within the sequence, the ribosome will stop there. So if the construct has an internal TGA, that would cause the protein to be truncated, and maybe not expressed in sufficient amounts because the ribosome stops early. So that would prevent proper overexpression.

Wait, but maybe the TGA is at the end. Looking at the sequence, the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last codons before the 3' end are ...GAG TGA. GAG is Glu, TGA is stop. So the construct ends with a stop codon. Oh, wait, but that's the intended stop. So the last codon is TGA. Then why is the construct not expressed?

Wait another thought: Maybe the TGA is actually in the middle. Let me see the entire sequence length.

The sequence is long. Let me break it down. The ORF starts at ATG and ends at TGA. So perhaps the ORF is correctly terminated. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, another angle. The person added the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So the construct would be HA-tagged. But perhaps there's a mistake in the coding sequence, like a frame shift or a premature stop.

Wait another thought: the mRNA is read as 5' to 3', and the ribosome translates it. If the construct includes a stop codon earlier than expected, the protein would be truncated. Let me check for any TGA, TAG, or TAA codons in the middle.

Looking through the sequence: ...ATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCAT
