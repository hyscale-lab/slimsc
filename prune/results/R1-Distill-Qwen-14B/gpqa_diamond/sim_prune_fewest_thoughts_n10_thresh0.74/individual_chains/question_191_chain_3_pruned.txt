Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what each step does and how the structure changes.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So, the cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2–CH(CH2)–, but wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH–CH2– but in a different arrangement. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually the group CH(CH2) with a double bond. Oh wait, no. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So that would be the group from the second carbon. So it's CH2–CH2– but with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So, actually, it's CH2=CH–CH2– but attached at the middle carbon? Wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group: the structure is CH2–C(=CH2)–. No, wait, no, that's not right. Let's see: the parent chain is propene, which is CH2=CH2CH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So, the structure is CH2=CH– attached to the cyclohexane at the middle carbon, making it a substituent with a double bond. So, the 5-position has a group that's CH2–CH2 with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)CH2 with a double bond. Hmm, maybe I should draw it out, but since I can't, I'll have to proceed.

So, step one: treating with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium
