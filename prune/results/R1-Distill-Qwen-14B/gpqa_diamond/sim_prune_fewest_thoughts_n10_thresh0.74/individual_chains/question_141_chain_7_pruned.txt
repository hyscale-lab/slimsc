Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products form from this reaction. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, 1-bromo-2-d... Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Oh, wait, no, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,3-dichlorobenzene? Wait, no, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which is a bit unclear. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, or something else? Or perhaps the "d" stands for something else. Wait, maybe I should just assume it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3-dichlorobenzene? Wait, no, maybe the "d" is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. Let me think: benzene with a bromine at position 1 and some substituent at position 2. Oh
