Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out. The question says a light beam is going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, so first, I remember that in a medium, the speed of light depends on the refractive index. The formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the glass is moving, so I think I need to consider how the movement of the medium affects the observed speed of light.

Oh, right! The problem is about the relativistic addition of velocities. Because the glass is moving, and light is inside it, the observer in the lab frame might see a different speed than just c/n. But wait, waitâ€”no, because in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, no, because light is moving through a medium here. Hmm. Wait, no, the speed of light in the medium is v = c/n, regardless of the motion of the medium. But when you have the medium moving, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the light's speed as observed in
