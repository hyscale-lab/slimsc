Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

The solution given has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4●2H2O. The molecular weights are provided: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4●2H2O.

Wait, so the idea is to find the concentration of PO4^3- in this solution. I think this is a buffer solution problem because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Or wait, maybe it's more about the phosphate species in solution. Let me think.

Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid. It can donate three protons, so it has three dissociation steps. The given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So the first dissociation is H3PO4 ⇌ H2PO4^- + H+ (Ka1), the second is H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3).

The salts we have are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. Let's figure out what ions they produce.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4●2H2O, when dissolved, probably releases Na+ and HPO4^2- (but wait, considering the two waters, I think the formula would mean that the HPO4^2- comes from the salt, but the water is part of the hydrate, not the solution).

So when these salts dissolve, they contribute H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are adjacent species in the dissociation series of H3PO4. So this must form a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, because each can act as acid or base in the presence of each other.

Wait, wait. The solution contains both KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which gives HPO4^2-). So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? Or is the phosphate species in this solution a mix of these?

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, so maybe I'm looking for the concentration of PO4^3- in solution.

Wait
