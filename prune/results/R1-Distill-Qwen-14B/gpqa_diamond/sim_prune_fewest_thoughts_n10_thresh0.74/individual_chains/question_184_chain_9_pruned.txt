Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from benzene using a series of reactions. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out what each part of the molecule is. So, benzene with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. The substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Wait, the numbering is important here. Let me sketch this out mentally.

In benzene, the numbering starts such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Let me imagine the structure: ethoxy is at 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2.

Now, the question is about the reaction sequence to get there. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. Let me think about the typical reactions for substituting benzene.

The substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me consider their directing effects. Ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para director) because it's an electron-donating group (OCH2CH3). Nitro is a deactivating group (meta director) because it's electron-withdrawing. tert-Butyl is a bulky, activating group (since alkyl groups are activating, but bulky) and an ortho/para director.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituents are at 1, 2, 3. Let's think about the order of adding these groups. Because the order of substitution can affect where the groups end up.

Nitration (adding nitro groups) is a common reaction. But the nitro group is meta-directing, which might complicate the placement of other substituents.

Let me think about the possible steps:

1. Add tert-butyl group. Since it's a bulky substituent, adding it via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (using AlCl3 as a catalyst with tert-butyl chloride) would be a way. But wait, Friedel-Crafts is for activating rings, and once we have a substituent, the next substitution would depend on its directing.

2. Then, perhaps add ethoxy group. Ethoxylation can be done via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's tricky unless the ring is activated. Alternatively, perhaps we can use an etherification method. Wait, maybe using something like the Williamson ether synthesis? But that generally involves an alkoxide. Alternatively, perhaps using an ethyl halide with a catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: could we use a directing group strategy? Alternatively, perhaps using a nitration step, but nitro is meta directing. Hmm.

Wait, but let's think about each substituent and their positions relative to each other.

The target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, in the benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent to each other. Wait, no: positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a row. So, each substituent is meta to the next. Wait, that's not possible. Let me think again.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a straight line. That means ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at position 3, which is two positions away, so that would be meta to the ethoxy group. But then, the tert-butyl is at position 2, which is adjacent to both ethoxy and nitro. So, how would that fit in terms of directing.

Wait, perhaps the order of adding substituents is important. Let me think about adding substituents in a way that each step directs the next substitution correctly.

Let me outline possible steps:

Option 1:
- First, add the tert
