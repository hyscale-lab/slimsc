Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The options are about different transition routes and their probabilities. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and dipole transitions have certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules for dipole transitions again? Oh right! For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are:
- Δl = ±1 (the orbital angular momentum changes by one unit)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (the magnetic quantum number changes by 0, 1, or -1)

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state after two transitions is |1,0,0⟩. Let's break this down.

First transition: from n=3 to some intermediate state. The second transition goes from that intermediate to n=1.

So what are the possible intermediate states? The first transition must change n from 3 to something else. Since each transition is a dipole, Δn could be ±1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Because for hydrogen, the energy levels are determined by n, but the transitions aren't purely based on n changing by 1. Wait, no, the selection rules for n are a bit tricky. I think the Δn for dipole transitions isn't fixed like that. Wait, no, no, wait. For hydrogen, the principal quantum number can change by any amount as long as l changes by ±1. So the allowed transitions are when l changes by 1, but n can vary as needed.

Wait, more accurately, the main selection rule is Δl = ±1. So the initial state has l=0 (since it's |3,0,0⟩). So the first transition must go to a state where l=1, because l must change by ±1. So the first transition must be to a state with l=1.

So the first step is from l=0 to l=1. So the possible l after first transition is 1.

Now, what about the n? Hmm, the initial state is n=3. The first transition must go to a state with n=2 (since
