Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, along with the pH of the resulting solution. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, which is a base. So when you add a strong acid to it, they should neutralize each other. The reaction would produce iron(III) ions and water. Right, the reaction should look something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, isn't it? I think it's sparingly soluble in water, which is why it might not dissolve easily. So adding a strong acid would definitely help dissolve it because the acid would provide H+ ions to react with the OH- ions in Fe(OH)3.

So the first thing is to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So let's calculate that. Fe is 55.85, each OH group is 17 (16+1), and there are three OH groups. So 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85, yeah, it's about 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, the reaction equation is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+ ions. So the moles of H+ required are 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. Let's compute that: 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol of H+ needed.

The strong acid provided is monobasic, so each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. So the concentration of the acid is 0.1 M. We can find the volume needed using the formula: moles = concentration * volume. So rearranged, volume = moles / concentration.

Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³. Close enough, considering rounding errors. But wait, the question asks for the minimum volume. Did I miss something here?

Wait, maybe I should think about the stoichiometry again. Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- groups. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 can accept 3 moles of H+ to neutralize the hydroxide ions. So yes, that part seems correct.

So the volume of acid needed is approximately 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. So maybe that's the correct volume part.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. After dissolving Fe(OH)3 in the acid, we have Fe^3+ ions in solution. So the solution should be acidic because Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water
