Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, right? So if we're observing it in a lab frame, where the particle is moving, there's time dilation. Oh yeah, because according to special relativity, moving clocks run slower or wait, no, wait. No, the proper time is the shortest time measured in the rest frame. So from the lab's perspective, the lifetime is longer due to gamma factor.

The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. I think that refers to the ability to detect the decay products within a certain distance, so that they don't fly away too far. Because in the lab, the particles are moving, so the decay products will travel some distance before the decay is recorded. The resolution must be the minimum distance that the detector can resolve so that at least 30% of the decays are within that distance.

So, the setup is that the Bubble Chamber has an energy of 27 GeV. Wait, what does that mean? I think the energy of the X⁰ particle is given as 27 GeV. Because the problem states, "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." So, the X⁰ is moving with that energy.

The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. Hmm, so E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. Oh, wait, the energy is way higher than the rest mass, so it's definitely moving at a relativistic speed.

I remember that the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ₀. So, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²) or something like that. Wait, E is the total energy, which for a relativistic particle is gamma m c². So gamma would be E/(m c²). But since E is given in GeV and m is also in GeV, perhaps we can
