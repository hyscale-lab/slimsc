Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But wait, there are two parts to the question: A and B. Hmm, I need to tackle each part separately.

Alright, the first part (A) is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the shifting of a hydrogen and the simultaneous movement of a double bond or lone pair. For instance, in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups, like in some ketones or acids, tautomerism can occur.

Benzoquinone, I think, is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. It has two ketone groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. So, can it undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism usually requires adjacent groups that can shift, like in a diketone. But in benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are not adjacent; they're para to each other. So, maybe there's no adjacent H and O for tautomerism. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. They're at positions 1,3,5 which are alternate positions, so each is separated by one carbon. Wait, or are they adjacent? Let me visualize. 1,3,5 would be every other carbon on a six-membered ring. So each is two carbons apart. So, for example, positions 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So, in this structure, are there any adjacent carbonyl groups that might allow for tautomerism? Hmm, not exactly. Wait, wait. If each carbonyl is on alternate positions, maybe the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the necessary adjacent H isn't present. Or perhaps, considering the structure, maybe each carbonyl is on a carbon that's adjacent to another carbonyl? No, wait, each is two apart. So, no adjacent carbonyl groups. So, maybe cyclohexane-
