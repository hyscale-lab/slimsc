Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field, and I'm supposed to find the oscillation frequency of the z-component of its magnetic moment after the field changes. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the setup: the particle has a spin 1/2, and initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, which makes sense because the magnetic moment is usually aligned with the spin. So, when the magnetic field is along Z, the particle's energy levels are determined by the Sz component.

Then, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude B. So, the field changes from B in Z to B in Y. The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. 

Wait, so the particle starts in an eigenstate of Sz when the field is along Z. Once the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero because the magnetic field is zero. But then the new field is along Y, so the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, right? Because the energy would be something like -mu·B, but since mu is gamma S, the magnetic moment, the Hamiltonian should be H = -gamma * B · S.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz, so when B is along Z, H = -gamma B Sz. But when B is along Y, H becomes -gamma B Sy. Oh wait, wait. I might have to be careful with the signs. Let me think: the energy is H = -mu · B. So if mu is gamma Sz, then H = -gamma Sz B. Hmm, but when the field is in Y, that's H = -gamma B Sy.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is proportional to gamma times the component of spin in the direction of the field. Because mu is proportional to the spin, and the energy is -mu·B. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B Sy. Wait, no, wait: Let's get the signs right. The energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B. Since mu is gamma S, and the B is along Y, then H = -gamma S · B. So if
