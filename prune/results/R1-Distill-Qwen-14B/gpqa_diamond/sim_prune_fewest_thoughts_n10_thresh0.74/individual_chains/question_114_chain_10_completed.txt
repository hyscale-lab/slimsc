Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out which reagents are correct for the given reactions. Let me think through this step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction involves treating that product with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, wait, when I look closer, the first reaction's product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. But the starting material is butan-2-one, which is a ketone. So, NaCN is involved here. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. But wait, under what conditions does that happen?

I think the formation of a cyanohydrin comes into play here. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. So, the reagent A is probably an acid. Which acid? The options suggest H3O+ or something else.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. For the formation of the cyanohydrin, we usually add HCN to the ketone, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is using NaCN in an acidic condition. So butan-2-one plus NaCN and acid (like H3O+) would form a cyanohydrin. So that would make A as H3O+.

Looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, why would NaHSO3 be used? NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- which is a weaker acid than H3O+. But wait, could it be a different reaction?

Wait, but butan-2-one plus NaCN in acidic condition gives the cyanohydrin. So, yes, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction. The product of the first step is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hmm, that's a bit more complex. Let me parse that structure. So the molecule has a benzyl group attached to another benzene ring, and a hydroxyl and nitrile group on the same carbon in a butane chain.

Wait, the second step is reacting this with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile (-CN) group is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.

How does that happen? Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. Let me think about the conditions for that. I remember that nitriles can be oxidized using different reagents. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or using other strong oxidizing agents.

Wait, another possibility is that the nitrile is hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Hydrolysis of nitriles can produce amides or acids. If it's under strong acidic conditions, perhaps with HCl, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, in the first reaction, the product is a secondary alcohol (the hydroxy group) and a nitrile. So in the second reaction, reacting with B and water, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid.

So what reagents would cause that? I think that nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong acid conditions, like with HCl. Alternatively, using something like KMnO4 in acidic conditions could oxidize the nitrile. But for hydrolysis, I think HCl is used.

Wait, the second reaction's stoichiometry shows that water is involved, so it's probably a hydrolysis reaction. So reagent B is HCl. Looking at the options, for B, options A and C have HCl as B. Options B and D have CH3COOH as B.

So, if B is HCl, then the correct option would have A as H3O+ and B as HCl. Let me look at the options. Option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. That matches.

Wait, but wait another thing. The first reaction could be that butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in acidic conditions to form the cyanohydrin. So yes, A is H3O+.

So the reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl. Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that's the right choice.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, nitriles are converted to amides first and then to acids. Or maybe using H2SO4 as a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe the oxidation is done with other reagents like aqueous H2O2 under acidic conditions. But the options here don't have that. So the available options are limited.

Another possibility: in the second reaction, the nitrile is being oxidized. But oxidation of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid would require a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4. But in that case, the reagent would be something like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid. So if the second reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, using HCl as the reagent, that makes sense.

Alternatively, if it's an oxidation, then HCl might not be the right reagent. So maybe I should reconsider.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. Let's think about the possible reagents for nitrile to carboxylic acid.

One method is hydrolysis using HCl, H2O, and heat. The nitrile is hydrolyzed to the ammonium chloride salt, which upon acidification (HCl) becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 in acidic conditions would convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But how would that fit into the given options?

In the second reaction, the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (or the benzyl version). When you oxidize a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you typically need strong acidic conditions and an oxidizing agent like KMnO4. But in the options, B is either HCl or acetic acid.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's a cyanohydrin formation. So A is an acid, probably H3O+.

Second reaction: nitrile → carboxylic acid. So the reagent B must be something that can cause this conversion. Common reagents for nitrile to carboxylic acid are HCl (in aqueous solution, possibly with heat), or other strong oxidizing agents. Wait, KMnO4 in acidic conditions would oxidize the nitrile, but would that be considered here?

Looking back at the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. If the reaction is hydrolysis, then HCl would be the right choice. So option A would have B as HCl.

Wait, but if the second reaction is a hydrolysis of nitrile to acid, then using HCl would make sense. So that would support option A.

Wait another point: in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol and a nitrile on the same carbon. Then, in the second reaction, that nitrile is oxidized or hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group. But nitrile hydrolysis usually gives an amide or a carboxylic acid depending on conditions. For example, using H2O and acid, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under basic conditions, they might give carboxylates.

So in the second reaction, the reagent is H2O and B. Let me think: if B is HCl, then it's an acid. So the conditions would be aqueous HCl. That would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Yes, that makes sense. So the second reagent B is HCl. So in the options, option A has B as HCl. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

Yes, that's what we concluded.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires a ketone reacting with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** is the appropriate acid catalyst for this reaction, making **A = H₃O⁺**.

The second reaction converts the nitrile group of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile into a carboxylic acid. This transformation is achieved through the hydrolysis of the nitrile group. Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is commonly performed under acidic conditions, such as those provided by **HCl**. Therefore, **B = HCl** is the correct reagent for this step.

Combining these, the correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
