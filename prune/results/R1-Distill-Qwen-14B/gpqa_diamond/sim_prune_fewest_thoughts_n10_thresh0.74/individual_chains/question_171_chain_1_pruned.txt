Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions, either ortho, meta, or para. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when each of these substituents undergoes bromination.

The compounds given are numbered 1 to 6:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (phenyl acetate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the lowest para yield comes first, and the highest comes last.

First, I think about each substituent's directing effects. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) are ortho/para directors. These include groups like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3, etc. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, -Cl (in some cases), are meta directors.

Wait, but wait, Cl can be a bit tricky. Chlorine is an EWG, but it's also an ortho/para director because of its -I effect. Wait no, wait. Oh right, Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Because the inductive effect (withdrawing electrons) is stronger than the resonance effect? Or wait, I think for chlorine in benzene rings, the lone pairs can donate into the ring via resonance, making it an ortho/para director, but overall it's deactivating because the inductive effect is stronger. So substituents like Cl are ortho/para directors but deactivating.

Wait, but for nitro groups (-NO2) and carbonyl groups like -COOH and -COOEt (COOR), they are strong EWGs, so meta directors.

So, the substituents:

1) CH3: EDG, so ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the para position is possible, as well as ortho. Since the substituent is activating, the reaction occurs more readily.

2) COOEt: EWG, so meta director. So the para position isn't as favored as, say, in EDG cases. Wait, no. Wait, in meta director, the incoming group goes to the meta position relative to the substituent, so for substituents like NO2, COOH, etc., the major product is the meta isomer. So for compound 2, phenyl acetate, the substituent is COOEt, which is an EWG, so meta director. So when bromine adds, the main product would be the meta isomer, meaning that the para is not the major product. So the para yield would be lower.

3) Cl: as discussed, EDG via resonance, but overall EWG. So it's an ortho/para director, but deactivating. So bromination would still occur, but the para position would be a possible site, but perhaps the ortho is more favored? Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. For Cl, the major product would be para, but wait no, I think for Cl, the ortho is more substituted than para because of steric factors. Oh, wait, I remember that in chlorobenzene, the main product is the para-bromochlorobenzene, but wait, no, I thought that nitration of chlorobenzene gives more para product than ortho because of steric hindrance at ortho positions. Hmm, no, maybe I'm getting that confused. Let me think again: when a strong EDG is present, like -OCH3, the para product is major. But with Cl, which is a weaker EDG, but still an ortho/para director, the para product might not be the major.

Wait, I think in chlorobenzene, bromine substitution gives a mixture, but the major product is actually para because ortho positions are more hindered. Wait, no, wait, I think that chlorobenzene's bromination gives mainly para product, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a 3:1 ratio of para to ortho? I think I should check that. But for the purpose of this question, I'll proceed with what I remember.

4) NO2: strong EWG, so meta director. So the major product is the meta isomer. So the para product would be minor, so its weight fraction would be low.

5) C2H5: ethyl group is an EDG, so ortho/para director. So the para product is a possible major product, but again, perhaps more ortho is formed due to steric factors. Wait, ethyl is a bulky substituent, so maybe para is favored more than ortho. For example, toluene (methyl) directs more to para than ortho? Or maybe in ethylbenzene, the para is the major product because of steric hindrance at ortho positions. I'm a bit uncertain, but I think that for larger substituents, the para product is more favored because the ortho positions are more crowded.

6) COOH: strong EWG, so meta director. So the para product is not favored, so the para yield would be lower.

So now, for each substituent, the para product
