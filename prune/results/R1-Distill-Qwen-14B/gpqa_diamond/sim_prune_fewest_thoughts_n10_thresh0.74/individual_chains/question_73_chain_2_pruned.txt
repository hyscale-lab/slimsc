Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmmm, let me read the question again. 

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I remember that velocities don't just add up normally when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh right, you can't just say 0.6c plus 0.5c because that would be more than c, which isn't possible. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). So let me plug in the numbers. The astronaut with 2m is moving at 0.6c, and the one with 3m is at 0.5c. But wait, wait—am I adding the velocities correctly? Because relative velocity depends on the frame of reference. Hmm, which astronaut's frame are we considering for the relative speed?

Oh right, the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, but both are in the same direction, then from A's frame, B is moving at (v) where v is calculated using the velocity addition formula. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Wait, if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't simply the difference. Because in relativity, you can't just subtract the velocities either. So I'll have to use the formula. Let me set u as the velocity of the second object as seen from the first.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Let's say astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c in the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's velocity?

Wait, no, wait again. Maybe I should think in terms of frames. Let me consider the problem where the
