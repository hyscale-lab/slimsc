Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see if I can piece together what's happening.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide, resulting in product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, I think I should break this down into each step. Let's start with the first reaction.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, it's usually an elimination reaction. So maybe it's E2 elimination. The product would be an alkene because that's what elimination reactions typically form.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Alkenes are often oils or gases, but maybe in this case, the structure is rigid because of the adamantane framework. Oh, right, adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, so it's quite a stable structure. So when 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes elimination, two bromide groups are removed, and a double bond is formed between the two carbon atoms where the bromines were.

So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe a different diene? Wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So the structure is Br-C-C-Br in the adamantane framework. When KOH is used, each Br leaves, and each C forms a double bond with the adjacent C. So elimination would lead to a diene. Wait, no. Wait, elimination is between adjacent carbons, but 1,3 aren't adjacent. Oh wait, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, but in adamantane, positions 1 and 3 are two carbons apart. So elimination would form a double bond between carbon 1 and carbon 2, and another between 2 and 3? No, wait
