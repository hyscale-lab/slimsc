Okay, so I have this physics problem about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking at what energy a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe would be limited by this process. Hmm, I remember something about photon-photon interactions and pair production, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Let me think. The process given is gamma-gamma annihilating into an electron-positron pair. So, the reaction is γγ → e+ e-. The CMB has a certain photon density, so high-energy gamma-rays might interact with these CMB photons. If the gamma's energy is high enough, the probability of this interaction becomes significant, limiting their lifetime because they get absorbed quickly.

Wait, the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. I think the average energy is related to the blackbody spectrum, which for the CMB is about 0.001 eV, which is 1 meV. The CMB photon density is high because the universe is filled with them. So the total number of CMB photons per unit volume is important here.

The problem is about finding the gamma-ray energy where the mean free path becomes comparable to the size of the universe, or maybe the interaction rate becomes significant enough to limit the gamma's lifetime. So I need to find the energy where the lifetime due to this process is a certain value, maybe the age of the universe or something. Alternatively, perhaps the energy where the interaction cross-section multiplied by the photon density gives a certain rate.

I remember that in particle physics, the mean free path λ is the inverse of the interaction rate per unit length. The mean free path is λ = 1/(n σ v), where n is the number density of target photons, σ is the cross-section for the interaction, and v is the relative velocity of the gamma and CMB photon.

But wait, in the case of high-energy gamma-rays, the CMB photons are much lower energy. So the center-of-mass energy would be sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 E γ E_photon) because each photon has energy E_photon ≈ 1 meV. Wait, is that correct? The center-of-mass energy for two photons is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ) / c^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are in opposite directions, so the square of the sum would involve (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2, I think. 

Wait, for two photons moving head-on, the total energy is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is |p1| - |p2|, but their directions are opposite. Wait, actually, the magnitude would be |p1| + |p2| if they are moving in opposite directions. Hmm, maybe I should be careful.

So for two photons with energies E and e, moving opposite each other, the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E + e)^2 - (p E c)^2 + (p e c)^2? No, wait, photons have E = pc. So for each photon, E = pc. So for two photons moving in opposite directions, the total energy is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is E1/(c) - E2/(c) in magnitude. So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/c - E2/c) c )^2.

Wait, let me compute that. The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (vector sum of their momenta)^2 c^2. Vectorially, if they are moving opposite, their momenta are in opposite directions. So the vector sum is p1 - p2. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (p1 - p2) c )^2.

But since E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c, substitute:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) c )^2

= (E1 + E2)^2
