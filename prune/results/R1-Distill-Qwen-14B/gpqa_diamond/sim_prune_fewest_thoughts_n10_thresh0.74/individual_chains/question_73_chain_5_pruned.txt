Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the question has two parts: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me tackle them one by one.

First, for the relative speed. Oh wait, wait! Both astronauts are moving in the same direction, so from the perspective of one, how fast is the other moving? So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, the relative speed of B as seen by A is not just 0.1c, because relativity adds velocities differently.

The formula for relative velocity is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So plugging in v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. Let me compute that.

v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) 
= (-0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/c²)
= (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)
= (-0.1c) / 0.7
= -0.142857c approximately.

Wait, but relative speed is a magnitude, right? So it should be 0.1428c, roughly 0.14c. That matches one of the options, either C or D, which have 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now for the total energy. Hmm. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, so E = gamma * m c². But wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So I think
