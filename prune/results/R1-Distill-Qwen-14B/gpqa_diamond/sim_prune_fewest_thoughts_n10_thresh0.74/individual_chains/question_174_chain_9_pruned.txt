Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is about. It's about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments, comparing relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations. Hmm.

So the setup: an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. The fragments are such that one is twice as massive as the other, based on their rest masses. And the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. 

Wait, so initial mass is M, which is at rest, so its rest energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the two fragments' combined rest mass is 0.99M. Oh, so mass seems to have been lost, and that mass loss is converted into kinetic energy, I suppose. 

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. Then, we need to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, in MeV.

Okay, let's break it down.

First, let's find the rest masses of the two fragments. Let's call the lighter one m, so the heavier one is 2m. The sum m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the masses are m = 0.33 M and 2m = 0.66 M. 

Wait, but M is the initial mass, which is at rest. So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. The sum of the rest energies after fission is 0.99 M times c squared. But wait, since M is the rest mass, then M c² is 300 GeV. So the sum of the two fragments' rest energies is 0.99 * M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the initial rest energy was 300 GeV, and after fission, the rest energies add up to 297
