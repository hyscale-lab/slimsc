Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each compound one by one.

First, I remember that a compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, which means it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. But wait, there's more—some compounds might have other elements of asymmetry, like allene or certain double bonds, but I think the main focus here is on chiral centers.

Let's look at each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, let's draw this. The structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)Cl? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond starting at C1. So the structure is Cl-C double bonded to CH2, then another CH(CH3) at the end? Wait, perhaps it's more like Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second carbon. So structure: Cl—C=CH—CH2CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl on the first carbon, so structure is ClCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene
