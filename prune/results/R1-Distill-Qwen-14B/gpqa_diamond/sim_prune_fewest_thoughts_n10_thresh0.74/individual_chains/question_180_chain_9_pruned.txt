Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble those charges from infinity. Since all the charges are at rest, the potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are each at 2 meters from P. So the setup is like a central charge with 12 others around it, each at 2 meters. But wait, are the 12 charges in a symmetrical arrangement? Or are they just each at 2 meters from P, possibly in different directions? I think for the potential energy, it doesn't matter how they're arranged spatially, because each pair contributes to the total potential energy.

Wait, but how about the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 surrounding it? And also, the potential energy between each of the 12 surrounding charges themselves. Because each of the 12 charges would exert a potential on each other.

But wait, the 12 surrounding charges are constrained to be at 2 meters from P. So I'm assuming they're all fixed at 2m from P. But the question is about the minimum energy. So maybe the 12 charges are placed symmetrically, like on a sphere, so that the potential energy between them is minimized. Or perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the fixed charge and the others, and not the interactions among the 12. Wait, no, because the system's total potential energy includes all pairs.

So the total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs. So we have two contributions: the potential energy between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges, and the potential energy between
