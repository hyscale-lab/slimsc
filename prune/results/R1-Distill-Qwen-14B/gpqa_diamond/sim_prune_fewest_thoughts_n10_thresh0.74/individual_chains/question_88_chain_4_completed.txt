Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about rotavirus and the immune response in mice. Let me break it down.

The question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw that some GFP fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability.

Hmm, so what's happening here? I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses to enteric pathogens like rotavirus are initiated.

The GFP is on the capsid proteins, so when the mice eat them, the rotavirus would be processed in the stomach. The stomach has acid, which can break down proteins. So some GFP was destroyed, meaning the proteins were digested. But some made it through the mucus and reached the lymphoid organs.

Peyer's patches have M cells that sample antigens from the intestinal lumen. So the inner capsid proteins, even if some are destroyed, those that survive are taken up by these M cells. The M cells present the antigens to immune cells like dendritic cells or maybe directly to B cells in the patches.

The key point is that they isolated the proliferating cell population. In the immune response, when B cells encounter an antigen, they start proliferating and then differentiate. High variability in the variable heavy chain gene suggests that each cell has a different arrangement of V, D, J segments. Wait, but isn't that VDJ recombination something that happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow?

Wait, no. VDJ recombination is the process where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to form the heavy chain during B cell development. That happens when the B cell is in the bone marrow, right? If they're in the Peyer's patches, that's after the B cells have already been formed. So maybe that's not it.

Somatic hypermutation is another process. That happens during the generation of antibody diversity in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. So when B cells are activated, they undergo proliferation in the germinal centers, and during this process, their variable regions undergo mutations to increase the diversity of antibodies. That fits with the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. So after the initial VDJ recombination, further mutations can be introduced, leading to different sequences.

Wait, but in this case, the variable heavy chains have high variability. If the cells are still in Peyer's patches and perhaps in the initial stages of response, maybe they're in the process of generating diverse clones. So somatic hypermutation would cause the variability.

Alternatively, class switching recombination is about changing the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), which doesn't change the variable region. So that doesn't explain the variability in the variable chains.

VDJ recombination is a process that happens during B cell development, so maybe the cells here are already mature, so that's done. Hence, the high variability is probably from somatic hypermutation.

So the process is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The question involves an experiment where rotavirus capsid proteins tagged with GFP are delivered to mice via oral gavage. The GFP fluorescence is partially destroyed by stomach acid and mucus, but some GFP reaches the Peyer's patches, where it is taken up by immune cells. The isolated proliferating cell population shows high variability in their variable heavy chain genes.

Peyer's patches are specialized lymphoid tissues in the gut where immune responses to enteric pathogens are initiated. M cells in these patches sample antigens from the intestinal lumen and present them to immune cells. The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that generates diversity in the B cell receptor repertoire.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions to increase antibody diversity. This fits the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves the complement system targeting pathogens but does not explain the variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable region, so it cannot explain the observed variability.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow to generate the initial diversity of the heavy chain. However, the cells in question are already in the Peyer's patches, where VDJ recombination has already occurred.

The most plausible explanation for the observed variability is **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. This process introduces mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors, leading to the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes.

Answer: A
