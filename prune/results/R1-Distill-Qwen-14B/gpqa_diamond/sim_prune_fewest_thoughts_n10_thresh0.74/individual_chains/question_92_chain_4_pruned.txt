Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, let's see. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complex, but maybe I can break it down.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, that's the energy needed to break a carbon atom into its constituent parts, like from CO2 or something. But I'm not sure how that fits in here.

The bond energies provided are: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. So I guess I need to use these to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given molecule.

But wait, what's the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies? Oh right, I think it's something like the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the products. Or wait, the other way around. Oh, enthalpy of formation is the energy change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I need to calculate the energy released or absorbed when the compound is formed.

So the formula should be: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. When bonds are broken, you have to put in energy (endothermic), and when bonds are formed, energy is released (exothermic). So for the formation of a molecule, you're starting from elements, so you break the bonds in the elements (like C-C in graphite, C-H bonds in H2) and then form the bonds in the molecule.

Alternatively, another approach is the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bonds in the compound. The formula is: ΔH°f = [sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in reactants] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds formed in products].

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the molecule. To form the molecule, you take the elements (like carbon and hydrogen) and form the molecule, which has certain bonds.

Wait, the general formula is: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies in the elements) - (sum of bond energies
