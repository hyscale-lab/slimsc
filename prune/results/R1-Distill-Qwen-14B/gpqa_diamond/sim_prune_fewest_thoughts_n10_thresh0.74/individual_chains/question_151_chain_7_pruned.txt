Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they must be normalized, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, that's 6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state isn't normalized. But wait, when you measure observables, the probabilities depend on the projection, so I think the state must be normalized first. So perhaps I should normalize it.

Wait, is the state given already normalized? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a length (norm) of 1. So I think I need to divide each component by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector. So the actual state vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ] T divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector would be |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row (0,1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, the question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. So in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which is zero, then find the eigenvector corresponding to zero. Then, the probability is the square of the amplitude of that eigenvector in the state |ψ>.

But wait, alternatively, perhaps the matrix P is a projection operator, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, since the observable is given by matrix P, we can compute the possible eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, wait, but in this case, P is a Hermitian matrix because it's an observable. Because observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian operators. Let me check if P is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Looking at P:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, the conjugate transpose would swap rows and columns and take complex conjugates. But all elements here are real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So the transpose of P would be:

Column 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Column 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Column 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, that's not the same as P. So for P to be Hermitian, it must equal its transpose. So, does P equal its transpose? Let's see: for example, the element at row 2, column 1 is 1/sqrt(2), and in the transpose, row 1, column 2 is 1/sqrt(2). So the (2,1) element in P is 1/sqrt(2), same as (1,2) in the transpose. So, in the original P, the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) is also 1/sqrt(2). So the matrix is symmetric about the diagonal. Let me check all elements.

Row 1: [0, a, 0]
