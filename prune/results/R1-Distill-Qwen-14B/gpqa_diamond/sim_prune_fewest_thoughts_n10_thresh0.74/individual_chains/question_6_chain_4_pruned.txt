Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential given by V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The options are four different expressions involving quantum numbers n_x and n_y, and factors of hbar, k, and m.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, especially in two or three dimensions, it's useful to see if the potential can be separated into parts that depend on different variables. So maybe I should try to break this potential into radial and angular components.

Looking at the potential V(r,θ), it's a function of r and θ. The first term is (1/2)kr², which depends only on r. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ, which depends on both r and θ. Wait, but can I separate this? Let me think. Maybe express cos²θ in terms of multiple angles. Oh, right! I remember that cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos2θ)/2. So:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ]
Simplifying that, the second term becomes (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. So putting both terms together, the potential becomes:

(1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ
Which is ( (1/2 + 3/4) )kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Let me compute that: 1/2 is 0.5, 3/4 is 0.75. 0.5 + 0.75 is 1.25, which is 5/4. So:

V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, but that's in polar coordinates. How does this potential affect the separation of variables in the Schrodinger equation?

In polar coordinates, the time-independent Schrodinger equation is:

[- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) + (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²ψ/dθ²) ) ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E ψ.

But in the case where the potential is separable, say V(r,θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(θ), the equation can be solved by separation of variables. However, in this case, the potential has a term that's proportional to cos2θ. So I'm thinking of expressing the wavefunction in terms of angular momentum eigenstates.

Angular momentum operator is L² = -ħ² (1/r²) d²/dθ². So the eigenfunctions are the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m}(θ,φ), where l is the angular momentum quantum number. But wait, in this problem, we're in 2D, so φ is not involved. So maybe it's
