Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The structure is benzene with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering? Oh, wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering them as 1, 2, 3. So the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. Or wait, wait â€” let me think again. The compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. So position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 has tert-butyl, position 3 has nitro. So the ring has substituents at 1, 2, and 3 positions.

Now, the question is about the synthesis pathway. To do that, I need to consider the directing effects of each substituent and the order in which they are introduced because the order affects where the next substituent will attach.

Benzene is the starting material. I know that when you add substituents to benzene, each new group directs the next substitution based on its nature. For example, activating groups direct ortho and para, deactivating groups direct meta.

So let's think about each substituent and their directing effects:

- Ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group because it's an electron-donating group (it's an ether).
- tert-Butyl group is a bulky, activating, ortho/para-directing group since it's a strong alkyl group, which donates electrons via induction, making the ring more reactive.
- Nitro group (NO2) is a deactivating, meta-directing group as it's strongly electron-withdrawing.

Wait, but wait! The nitro group is meta-directing and deactivating. So when adding the nitro group, it will direct incoming groups to the meta position relative to itself. But wait, if I add the nitro group first, then that would influence where the next substituents go.

But wait, the target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So maybe the order in which these groups are added is crucial.

Let me think about the possible sequences. Let's consider each substituent and how they would be introduced.

But wait, the target molecule has three substituents. So the order of adding them would matter. Let's consider each step.

Option 1: Add nitro first. Nitro is a strong meta director. So after nitration, the ring has nitro at position 1. Then, adding ethoxy (which is activating, ortho/para
