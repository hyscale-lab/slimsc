Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of A⁺ and two of A⁻. The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. And we're asked to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, all different fractions of the speed of light.

Wait, but the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, that probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy, so maybe we can approximate it as being at rest. Or perhaps it's moving slowly enough that relativistic effects aren't too drastic. I'm not sure yet, but I'll keep that in mind.

First, I remember that in annihilation processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. So I need to apply conservation laws here. Let's think about the system before and after the annihilation.

Before the annihilation, we have a proton and an antiproton. The proton has rest mass m_p, and the antiproton has rest mass m_p as well (since they're each other's antiparticles). So their combined rest energy is 2 m_p c². But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible, so we can approximate that its velocity is zero. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is 'slowly moving', which might mean it's moving but not at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Hmm. So perhaps I can't assume it's at rest, but maybe its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy, so relativistic effects are minimal. Or perhaps I can model it using non-relativistic mechanics for the initial step, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps we can model it as a non-relativistic particle. Or perhaps we can treat the initial momentum as that of the antiproton, and the proton is initially at rest? Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify whether the proton is moving or the antiproton. Oh, wait, the way the process is written, it's p + p
