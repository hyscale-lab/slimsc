Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I remember is a model that considers both the rotational and vibrational energies of a diatomic molecule. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state. 

Alright, let me start by understanding the problem. The molecule is made of atoms X and Y with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is given as 4e14 rad/s. The options are all different momenta, so I need to figure out which photon's momentum would cause the transition.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. In the context of rotation-vibration models, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, I think. So the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, what's the order here? Are they considering the rotational or vibrational state change first?

Hmm, I recall that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotation and vibration. But perhaps when they say 'next state', they mean the next higher energy state, which would be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0), and the next is v=1. Alternatively, if the molecule is in a rotational state, then the next could be a higher rotational state.

Wait, but the problem says it's the molecule in its fundamental state. So perhaps the fundamental state is the ground state of rotation and the ground state of vibration. So the next state would be the next energy level, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which transition is allowed by the selection rules?

In molecular spectroscopy, for a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for vibration are Δv = ±1, and for rotation, ΔJ = ±1. But wait, when considering electronic transitions, the selection rules differ, but in this case, it's about a photon being absorbed, which would cause a transition, probably in either the rotation or vibration.

Wait, but the question is about the molecule switching to the next
