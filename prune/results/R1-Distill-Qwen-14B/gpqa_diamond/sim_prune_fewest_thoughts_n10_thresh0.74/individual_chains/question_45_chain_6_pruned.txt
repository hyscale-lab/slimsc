Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Let me try to break it down. The question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in this well, and I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, the well has length L. I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula they gave is E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), but each energy level is a multiple of this E. Specifically, the energy levels are E_n = n²E, where E is the base energy they provided. So the first level is E_1 = 1²E = E, second is E_2 = 4E, third E_3 = 9E, and so on.

But wait, spin comes into play here. The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions and must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold only one particle. But in a 1D infinite well, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin state, right? So each n can have two possible spin states, say up and down. So for each n, you can have two particles.

Hmm, so the four particles are spin-1/2, so each can have spin up or down. But each energy level for a given n can accommodate two particles. So how do the four particles fill up the energy levels?

In the ground state, the lowest energy is achieved by filling the lowest possible orbitals. Let's arrange the particles' quantum numbers.

The first energy level is n=1 with energy E_1=1E, but since n=1 can hold two particles (spin up and down), so two particles will go into n=1. Then the next level is n=2, with E_2=4E. That can also hold two particles. So for four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) are filled. So the ground state would have particles in n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the total energy would be 2*(n=1) + 2*(n=2) = 2*1E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E? Wait wait, but each particle has their own energy, so the total
