Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is saying.

Alright, the question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, wait, actually, the question says the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio, but each is a singlet. Then there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present.

The options are four possible pairs of compounds. Let me list them:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

So, first, I think I should figure out the structures of each compound and their expected NMR signals.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check each compound:

Tetramethylbenzenes would have four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring. Each methyl is CH3. Benzene has 6 carbons, so four methyl would add 4*3=12 H. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. Adding four methyl groups (each is CH2CH3?) Wait no, each methyl is CH3, so each adds one carbon and three hydrogens. So four methyl groups would add four carbons and 4*3=12 H. So total would be C6 +4= C10, H6 +12= H18. But the formula is C10H14, which is 14 H. So that can't be. Oh wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, no, the molecular formula of each compound is C10H14.

Wait, perhaps each compound is not a tetramethylbenzene. Let me recalculate. Tetramethylbenzene would be C6H5(CH3)4, right? Which would be C10H14. Because:

C6 (benzene) + 4*(CH3) = C10. Hydrogens: benzene has 5 H (since it's substituted, but wait, the actual H count is different). Wait, benzene (C6H6). When you substitute with methyl groups, each substitution replaces a H. So each CH3 adds 3 H. So the parent is C6H6. Adding
