Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, we have three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But maybe that's not super relevant here; the question is about their orbital periods.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, temperature ratios are 1.4 and 2.3 respectively. Then, the masses have ratios 1.15 between Planet1 and Planet2, and 1.35 between Planet2 and Planet3. So, Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet3 is a bit more massive than Planet2.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. And all have the same albedo, 0.3, which is Earth-like.

Hmm. So I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4), where L is luminosity, a is albedo, and d is the distance from the star. Since all three planets have the same star (I think), L and a are the same for all. So T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2), because d is in the denominator and raised to the second power.

Wait, but the planet's distance is related to its orbital period via Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (assuming the same star). So P² ∝ a³.

Wait, but the problem gives me temperature ratios, which relate to the distances. So let's think about getting the distances from the temperature ratios.

The equilibrium temperature formula can be rewritten as T ∝ sqrt( (L (1 - a) ) / (d²) ). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). Because d is in the denominator under square root. So T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance.

Wait, more precisely, T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4). So T ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4) = 1/d^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(d). So yes, T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance.

So if Planet1's temperature is T1, Planet2's T2 = T1 * 1.4, but wait, wait. Wait, the ratio of T1 to T2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 =1.4 → T2 = T1 / 1.4.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1 / T2 = 1.4. So T1 is higher than T2 by a factor of 1.4. Because higher temperature would mean closer to the star, since temperature decreases with distance.

So if T1 is higher than T2, Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2. Similarly, T2 over T3 is 2.3, so T2 / T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3. That means T3 is smaller than T2, so Planet3 is farther than Planet2.

So, the distance is inversely related to the square of the temperature (since T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d)). So d ∝ 1/T². Wait, no, because T ∝ 1/sqrt(d), so sqrt(d) ∝ 1/T → d ∝ 1/T².

Wait, let me get this right. Let's say T is proportional to
