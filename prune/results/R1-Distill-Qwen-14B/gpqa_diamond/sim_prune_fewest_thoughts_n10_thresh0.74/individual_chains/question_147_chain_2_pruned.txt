Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, annihilation usually involves particles and their antiparticles, right? The process given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says p plus p-bar going to two A+ and two A-. Oh, but wait, I thought protons annihilate with antiprotons, so maybe the products are different particles here.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess its kinetic energy is low compared to the rest mass. And the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about what's given. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. I think their rest masses are about 938 MeV each, right? Because the proton mass is around 938 MeV/c². So when they annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be conserved.

Wait, but in the process, the products are four particles: two A+ and two A-. So each A has a mass of 300 MeV/c². Hmm.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, that suggests that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So, maybe the initial total energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. Wait, but wait, the proton is at rest? Because the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is at rest. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is low. But I think in such problems, sometimes one is taken as stationary for simplicity.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some low speed. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's velocity is small. Hmm, but I think for this problem, we can model the initial system as the proton being at rest, and the antiproton moving with some velocity. Or wait, maybe the initial system is that the proton and antiproton are colliding, but the antiproton is moving slowly, meaning that its speed is much lower than the speed of light. So perhaps the initial total energy is not too much higher than the sum of their rest masses.

Wait,
