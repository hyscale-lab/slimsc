Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question says an electron is moving at a speed v of 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. They want the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. The options are from 1e-18 to 1e-16 J. 

Wait, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved here. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. The formula for the uncertainty in momentum and position is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, the first step is to find the uncertainty in momentum Δp. Since Δx is given as 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. Using the uncertainty principle, Δp is at least (ħ)/(2Δx). Wait, but I think sometimes people ignore the 2 for order of magnitude estimates. Let me double-check. Oh, right, the principle is often approximated as Δx Δp ≈ ħ/2, but sometimes the factor is ignored for simplification, especially in multiple-choice questions. So I'll proceed with the approximation, maybe that's what the problem expects.

So plugging in the numbers: ħ is about 1e-34 J·s, right? So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Let me calculate that. 

Δx is 0.1e-9 m. So 2Δx is 0.2e-9 m. So, ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34) / (0.2e-9) = (1.05 / 0.2) * 1e-34+9 = 5.25e-26 kg·m/s. Wait, 1e-34 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-24? Wait wait, no. Wait, 0.2e-9 is 2e-10. So 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1/2)*1e-24, which is 0.5e-24. So that's 5e-25 kg·m/s. Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate that.

Wait another approach: 1e-34 divided by 0.2e-9 is the same as (1 / 0.2) * 1e-34 / 1e-9. 1/0.2 is 5. And 1e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-25. So yeah, 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, no, wait. 0.2e-9 is 2e-10 m. So, when I compute ħ/(2Δx) = (
