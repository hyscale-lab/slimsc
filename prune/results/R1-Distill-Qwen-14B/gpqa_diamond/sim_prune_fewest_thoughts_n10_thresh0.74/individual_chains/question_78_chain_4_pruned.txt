Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is about potentials, not the fields themselves. Let me think about how potentials work for moving charges.

I recall that the scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B. The potentials are usually derived from Maxwell's equations, right? For a static charge, the scalar potential is simple, like Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, it's more complicated.

Wait, the setup says the charge q is moving with a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. Oh, right, that means d is the displacement between the charge's position at time tr and the field point r.

The velocity of the charge at the time tr is v. So, I think I should be considering the retarded time concept because the fields at r are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr.

As for the potentials, I remember that the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just the static Coulomb potential. Because the charge is moving, there might be some corrections involving its velocity.

Wait, I think the scalar potential V is given by the static Coulomb potential divided
