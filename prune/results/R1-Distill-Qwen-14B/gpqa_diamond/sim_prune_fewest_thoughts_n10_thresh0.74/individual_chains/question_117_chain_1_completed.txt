Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, as I remember, has to do with stereoisomerism where the compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. That usually requires the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups.

Let me go through each option one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, so this is a biphenyl compound. The main structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene. The groups attached are nitro groups and ester groups. Wait, each of the two central carbons (on each benzene) has two methyl ester groups and two nitro groups? Wait, no, dimethyl would imply that each carboxylate is esterified with a methyl group. So each 2 and 2' positions have a methyl ester and a nitro group. Wait, if the central ring is 1,1'-biphenyl, then the substituents are at 6 and 2 on each benzene. Wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each benzene has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2. But wait, for each benzene, the substituents at 6 and 2 would be. So each benzene ring has two substituents: one nitro and one ester group.

Wait, but in biphenyls, especially para or meta substituents, the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are on both rings in such a way that creates a plane of symmetry, then the molecule might not be chiral.

Let me think. If each benzene has a nitro and an ester group at positions 2 and 6, which are ortho to each other. Wait, no, benzene numbering: positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. So 1 is where the two rings are connected. So 2 is adjacent to 1, and 6 is adjacent to 1 as well. So each benzene has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So for each benzene, substituents in the ortho positions relative to the connecting bond.

Wait, but if each benzene has two groups at ortho positions, and the two substituent types (nitro and ester) are on each ring, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. If the substituents on each benzene are in such a way that the whole molecule is symmetrical, then it would not have a chiral center. So if each benzene has a nitro and an ester, but arranged symmetrically, then maybe the entire molecule is achiral. So perhaps no optical isomerism here.

Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then maybe there's a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system itself can lead to some kind of isomerism. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center where four different groups are attached. Let's think: the central carbon? Wait, no, the biphenyl is connected via a single bond. Wait, each substituent is on the benzene rings, so the central part is a single bond between two carbons. So maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that each benzene is identical, making the molecule symmetric. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism because it's symmetrical. So I'll tentatively say no optical isomerism for option 1.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, I think that's another name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw its structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So when it's the ester, it's methyl ester: the structure would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, so the carbon chain is three carbons. The middle carbon (2nd) has a hydroxyl group, and the ester is on the third carbon.

Wait, so the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH2 and a CH(OH)CH3? Wait, maybe I should think again.

Propanoate ester is CH2CH2COOCH3. For 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the ester would be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3. So the middle carbon is attached to: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (which is attached to the other CH3). Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is CH3. So the middle carbon is connected to:

- one methyl group (CH3),
- one hydroxyl (OH),
- one carbonyl group (COOCH3),
- and the other side is a CH group (attached to the COOCH3).

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is the ester group, attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to another CH3.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's four carbons, but propanoate is three. So perhaps it's:

HO-CH2-C(O)OCH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's:

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) would have CH2 groups on both sides. So the central carbon is connected to two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, no. Let's count: for propanoate, it's CH2CH2COOCH3. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon.

So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. That would make the second carbon connected to two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, no. Wait, the second carbon would have:

- one CH2 group (the first carbon: CH3),
- one CH2COOCH3 group (third carbon),
- a hydroxyl group,
- and another hydrogen? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. No, that's not possible, because propanoate has three carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to a CH3.

Wait, that's three carbons: the first is CH3, the second is CH(OH), the third is COOCH3. So the second carbon is connected to CH3 (from the first), COOCH3 (third), OH, and another CH2? No, wait, it's connected to the first and third carbons via single bonds. So the second carbon is CH(OH) connected to the first (CH2) and the third (COOCH3). Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up, but perhaps the second carbon has four different groups attached: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH2 group. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the second carbon has a CH2 group on one side, and a COOCH3 and OH on another. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center. Let me check if any of these compounds have a chiral center.

For compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's imagine the structure. The propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that would make the second carbon have two CH2 groups attached (from CH2(OH) and CH2COOCH3), an OH, and another hydrogen. So the groups attached to the second carbon would be:

- OH,
- CH2CH2COOCH3 (wait, no),
Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. No, that would be an isopropyl group, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to the first (CH2OH) and third (COOCH3) carbons. Wait, no, perhaps the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to a CH3 and a COOCH3 group, and another CH2 group. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the key point is whether the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) has four different groups attached.

Wait, if the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from CH3-),
- COOCH3 (from -COOCH3),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen? No, wait, that can't be right because then there's a hydrogen, which would make four groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and CH-? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) has four different substituents.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as (CH3)CO-OCH2-CH(OH)-something. No, perhaps it's better to just consider whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, it would exhibit optical isomerism.

If the structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the OH) would have:

- CH3,
- CH2COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group. Wait, that's two CH2 groups, so two similar groups, which would make it not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism in that case.

Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The second carbon (the one with OH) would have two CH2 groups (the one next to it on either side), an OH, and a COOCH3. So the substituents would be:

- two CH2 groups,
- OH,
- COOCH3.

Wait, but two substituents are the same (CH2 groups on either side?), so it's not four different groups. So the central carbon isn't a chiral center. Hmm, but I must have made a mistake because I thought 2-hydroxypropanoate is known to have optical isomerism.

Wait, wait, maybe the structure is different. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is also known as glyceric acid. Its structure is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- COOCH3 (from the third),
- OH,
- and another CH (from the first carbon?), but wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CHOH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and the adjacent carbon (from the CH3 group, which is a CH2 group? Or is it a single bond? Hmm.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (that's one substituent),
- COOCH3 (another),
- OH (third),
- and the adjacent carbon from the CH3CH(OH) part, which is a CH2 group.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (first substituent),
- COOCH3 (third substituent),
- OH (second substituent),
- and a hydrogen (from the CH(OH) group).

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the central carbon is CH(OH), then the substituents would be CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that's four groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, the central carbon has four different groups attached, making it a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 has optical isomerism.

3. benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is phenyl. Its structure is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups and another carbon (maybe a CH3, but no, benzophenone would be Ph-CO-Ph. Wait, no, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, which is a ketone with two phenyl groups on either side of the carbonyl.

So the carbonyl carbon has:

- two phenyl groups (Ph),
- a carbonyl oxygen (O=),
- and another substituent, perhaps a CH3? No, wait, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, so the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the carbonyl carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. But wait, that leaves only three substituents, but carbonyl is a double bond, so the carbon is double-bonded to O and has two phenyl groups and perhaps a hydrogen? No, wait, no. Wait, benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, which is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. But wait, that's three groups. Oh, wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so the carbon has a double bond to O and two single bonds to the phenyl groups. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, that's a planar structure around the carbonyl carbon. So the carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized. Therefore, it's trigonal planar and can't have a chiral center. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus can't exhibit optical isomerism. So option 3 does not have optical isomerism.

4. dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate is the ester form. Dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So when esterified with two methyl groups, it's (Z)-dimethyl fumarate.

The structure of fumarate is a trans-diepoxy structure. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer, while maleate is the cis. So dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but in the trans configuration. No, wait, no, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So the diesters would be (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3), but wait, maybe it's (E)-butenedioate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, wait, correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Or, more accurately, O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the E configuration.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, which is double-bonded to a CH group, which is attached to another O-C-OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–O-C-OCH3?

No, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but wait no. Wait, butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, butenedioic acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH. No, wait, that wouldn't have a double bond. Oh wait, fumaric acid is (E)-HO₂C-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3)? No, wait, the dimethyl ester would be (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3), but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH2 group, which is double-bonded to another CH2 group, which is connected to O-C-OCH3. So it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond, making it CH2=CH(COOCH3)₂ in the E configuration.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure of fumarate is two ester groups on adjacent carbons, connected by a double bond. So, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3, but with a double bond between the two central CH groups. So, the structure would be O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3, but that's not a double bond. Alternatively, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3, but with a double bond between the CH₂ and CH₂. So it's O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3 with a double bond between the middle carbons: O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3 → O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3? No, I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurate to think of dimethyl fumarate as (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond in between, making it CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So each of the CH₂ groups is attached to a COOCH3 group and connected by a double bond.

But wait, in that case, the molecule would have a central double bond with two ester groups on each end. Now, for this molecule, are there any chiral centers? No, because the central double bond is between two identical groups (each CH₂(COOCH3)), but in the case of fumarate, perhaps it's a trans arrangement. Wait, but if each end is the same, then the molecule can't have a chiral center, but it can exhibit geometric isomerism (cis and trans). But optical isomerism is about stereoisomerism due to chiral centers, not geometric isomerism.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is an example of a compound with two ester groups on each side of a double bond. If the substituents on either side are identical, then the molecule is achiral. So in dimethyl fumarate, each ester group is the same (methyl), so the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, I thought fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents in a way that it's not symmetrical, leading to a possibility of cis and trans isomers. But optical isomerism is about mirror images, so unless there's a chiral center, there's no optical isomerism.

Wait a minute, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another approach: dimethyl fumarate has the structure where on each end of the double bond, there's a COOCH3 group. So the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, there's no chiral center. So it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Therefore, option 4 doesn't have optical isomerism. But wait, I'm not sure. Another possibility: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So, if the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, since it's the trans isomer, perhaps it's a meso compound. Meso compounds have multiple stereocenters but are achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. Does dimethyl fumarate have any stereocenters? Let me think. The ester groups are on each end, but if the double bond is trans, each ester group is on opposite sides. But in reality, each ester group is on the same carbon, so perhaps each COOCH3 is on the same carbon, making the molecule symmetrical.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again. Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)₂. No, that's not right. Because fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite ends of the double bond. So, the structure would be O
||
O-C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–O-C-OCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, it's O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–C(O)OCH3, but with a double bond, making it O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–C(O)OCH3. No, that's not possible because the double bond would be between the two CH₂ groups, making it O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–C(O)OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂, creating a structure like O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–C(O)OCH3 → no, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3), which would be symmetrical. So, each CH₂ group is attached to two COOCH3 groups, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center and can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another approach: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. Its structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–C(O)OCH3?

No, that's not correct. Let me try to write the correct structure. Fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl ester would replace the two -OH groups with -OCH3. So, the structure would be (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3). Wait, but that can't be because each COOCH3 would be on adjacent carbons. So the correct structure would be (E)-CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond carries a COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, that's not possible because each CH in the double bond can only have three substituents besides the double bond. So, the correct structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3), but with a double bond. So, (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂? No, that doesn't make sense because each CH would have more than three substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond. Wait, but that would require four substituents on each CH, which isn't possible.

I'm getting stuck on the structure, but I think the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. If each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups, then each carbon would have two identical substituents, making the molecule symmetrical. So, the molecule would be achiral, and thus, no optical isomerism. Therefore, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: if the molecule has a double bond with two substituents on each end, but those substituents are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, and there's no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm also recalling that dimethyl fumarate is an example of a compound with a double bond that can undergo ring-opening reactions, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Hmm, putting all this together:

Option 1: No optical isomerism (if symmetrical).
Option 2: Yes, because it has a chiral center.
Option 3: No.
Option 4: No.

Wait, but the options given are A) 1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1,2.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only option 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 1.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So, on each benzene, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting bond (position 1). So each benzene has two substituents: a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2.

Now, the question is whether this molecule is chiral. The biphenyl system can have different conformations, but does it have a chiral center?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the biphenyl, the molecule might be achiral. But if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene. Suppose each benzene has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. Then, the arrangement could be such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, the nitro and ester groups on each benzene are arranged in a way that they mirror each other across the central axis.

If that's the case, the molecule would be achiral, and thus, no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged so that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. But I'm not sure how they are arranged in this case.

Wait, another approach: if the substituents on each benzene are in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral. However, in this specific case, since both substituents (nitro and ester) are on each benzene, and given the positions, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, another angle: the substituents on each benzene are both at the 2 and 6 positions. So, the arrangement on each benzene is such that the nitro and ester are at positions that are mirror images across the central axis. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

So, option 1: no optical isomerism.

So, from the four options, only option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.

But wait, the options don't include any choice where only option 2 is correct. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 1,2 and 4
B)3 and 4
C)2 and 3
D)1 and 2

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: is there a possibility of a chiral center?

Wait, let's consider another approach. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Maleic acid is cis, fumaric is trans. The dimethyl ester of fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioate.

In the case of (E)-butenedioate, each of the two central carbons has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, for each of those carbons, the substituents are:

- COOCH3,
- another COOCH3,
- and the double bond.

Wait, but each carbon in a double bond is connected to two substituents. So, for each of the two carbons in the double bond, they have:

- two COOCH3 groups,
- and a double bond.

So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3), making the molecule symmetrical. Thus, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, so in that case, only option 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only option 2 selected. The options are A) 1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1 and 2.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake because the options suggest that more than one option may have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I overlooked something. Let me consider option 4 again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: perhaps it's not symmetrical. Wait, the structure is O
||
O-C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–C(O)OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–C(O)OCH3. No, that's not correct because that's a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)–CH=CH–C(O)OCH3. In that case, the two middle carbons are each connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen, with a double bond between them.

Wait, in that case, each of the two middle carbons would have:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and the double bond.

So each carbon in the double bond has substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. So, each carbon would have two Hs, which would make them CH₂ groups. Wait, no, perhaps each is CH with a double bond. So, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is CH, with a COOCH3 group and a H attached. So, each would have two substituents: COOCH3 and H. In that case, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a H, and the double bond. So, for each of those carbons, they would have: COOCH3, H, and double bond. Therefore, each carbon would have three substituents: COOCH3, H, and two other carbons (from the double bond), but wait, in a double bond, each carbon is connected to three groups. So, each would have:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and the double bond (which connects to another carbon).

Wait, perhaps each of the two middle carbons has:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and a double bond to the other carbon.

Therefore, each of these carbons would have two different substituents (COOCH3 and H) and the double bond. So, each would have two substituents, and thus, each would not have four different groups attached, so no chiral centers.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so going back, only option 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4; which would mean I must have made a mistake in my analysis of options 1 and 4.

Wait, perhaps option 1 is a chiral molecule. Let's think again about option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond), with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each substituent is a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents on each ring make it impossible for the molecule to have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. Let me imagine the structure: each benzene has a nitro group at 6 and an ester group at 2. So, the ester is at position 2, which is adjacent to the connecting bond (position 1). The nitro is at position 6, which is also adjacent to position 1.

In such a case, the two substituents on each benzene are adjacent to the connecting bond. So, perhaps each benzene has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other relative to the connecting bond. So, for each benzene ring, substituents are on adjacent positions, but their arrangement might create an overall asymmetry in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is planar, with substituents arranged symmetrically on both rings. In that case, the molecule would be achiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but in the case of 1,1'-biphenyl, the two rings are connected by a single bond, which allows free rotation. So, unless the substituents are in a fixed conformation, the molecule could have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a fixed arrangement of substituents leading to chirality.

Wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral. So, if the substituents on each benzene are arranged in a way that creates asymmetry, the molecule would be chiral.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: perhaps the molecule has a chiral center. But where? Biphenyls don't have chiral centers; they have a single bond between two carbons. So, unless one of the substituents is a chiral center, the molecule isn't chiral. In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene, which are para to each other on the benzene ring. Wait, no, each substituent on a benzene is at position 2 and 6 relative to the connecting bond. So, if each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, then the arrangement might be symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical along the plane that bisects the two rings, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's substituents are arranged in a way that it's not symmetrical, making it chiral.

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the correct approach is to accept that option 1 does have a chiral center. However, I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of other possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a chiral center but could have a different type of stereoisomerism, like enantiomerism via a different mechanism. But without a chiral center, I don't think that's possible.

Wait, another thought: some compounds exhibit optical isomerism due to the presence of a plane of asymmetry, which doesn't involve a chiral center. But I'm not sure. Wait, no, optical isomerism typically requires a chiral center or a meso compound, but I'm not sure about that.

After thinking all this through, perhaps the correct answer is that only option 2 has optical isomerism. But looking back, the options don't allow for that, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option 4 does have optical isomerism. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: if the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond between them, then each CH₂ group is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each CH₂ group has two identical substituents, making them not chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Let's think about the actual compounds.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (option 2) definitely has a chiral center because the central carbon has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, it can have optical isomers.

Dimethyl fumarate (option 4) is an ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. But in terms of optical isomerism, if the ester has a chiral center, it would exhibit it. Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and the double bond. So, each has two identical substituents, thus no chiral centers.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let's think about the structure of fumarate. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is O
||
O-C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–C(O)OCH3, but with a double bond. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond between the CH₂ groups, making it CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Wait, that can't be right because each CH could only have three substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O
||
O-C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–C(O)OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, each of those CH₂ groups is attached to a COOCH3 group. So, each CH₂ is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- two CH₂ groups,
- and a double bond.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two CH groups in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a H. So, the structure would be CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Wait, that doesn't seem right because each CH would have two substituents besides the double bond.

I think I'm stuck on the structure. Let me think differently. Dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-dioic acid. So, the structure would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. If each ester group is attached to the same type of carbon, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical, leading to the possibility of optical isomerism. But without a chiral center, I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: consider if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If each substituent on either side of the double bond is mirrored, then it's achiral. For example, if each ester group is on the same side or opposite sides, but if the molecule is symmetrical, it won't be chiral.

In the case of (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups would be on opposite sides of the double bond. But each ester is attached to a CH group, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, no chiral centers, no optical isomerism.

So, after all this, I think only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, there's no choice with only option 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps looking back at option 4: dimethyl fumarate is an example of a compound that can exhibit geometric isomerism (cis and trans), but not optical isomerism. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Now, considering the options again, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1, 2, and 4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about option 1. Let me think again. If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule could be chiral. So, if the substituents on each benzene are not symmetrical, the molecule could have a chiral center.

Wait, but the substituents are on each benzene ring at positions 2 and 6. So, each benzene has a nitro and an ester group. If the substituents are arranged so that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a chiral center. For example, if the substituents on each benzene are in positions that create a chiral center in the biphenyl system.

Wait, but biphenyls usually don't have chiral centers; they have a single bond between the two carbons, leading to possible rotation. So, unless the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a rigid structure, the molecule wouldn't be chiral.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option 4 doesn't have optical isomerism. So, only option 2 does.

But again, none of the options have only option 2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, I must have made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Suppose the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that each of the two central carbons has a COOCH3 and a H, and a double bond. Then, each carbon would have three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. So, each would have two substituents besides the double bond. But in that case, each carbon would have only two substituents, making them CH groups. So, each would have:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and the double bond connecting to the other carbon.

In that case, each carbon has two different substituents (COOCH3 and H), but also the double bond. So, for each carbon, the substituents are COOCH3, H, and the double bond, which essentially is a substituent to another carbon. But wait, in this case, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two different substituents (COOCH3 and H), and the double bond. So, each carbon would have two substituents, but for a chiral center, a carbon must have four different groups. So, in this case, each carbon in the double bond has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond (which is a substituent leading to another carbon). Therefore, each has three substituents, which isn't enough for a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. Otherwise, it's chiral. But without a chiral center, it can't have optical isomerism.

So, after all this, I think only option 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps option 4 has a chiral center. Let me think again. Wait, if the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond between them, making it CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Then, the two CH groups in the double bond each have a COOCH3 group and a H. So, each CH has two substituents: COOCH3 and H, and the double bond. So, each has two substituents, which isn't enough to form a chiral center.

Wait, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the conclusion that only option 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps option 4 has two chiral centers. Wait, if dimethyl fumarate is (E), perhaps each of the two ester groups is on a different carbon, leading to a possibility of a chiral center. But in reality, each ester group is on the same carbon, making them identical, thus not creating a chiral center.

Hmm. I think I've spent enough time; perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option 4 does have optical isomerism, but I'm not certain.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option for the presence of a chiral center, which is required for optical isomerism. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each benzene has a nitro group (NO₂) and a methyl ester group (COOCH₃). The molecule is symmetrical due to the arrangement of substituents, and no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. Therefore, it does not have a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CHOH-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and a hydrogen. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone is a ketone with the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. Since no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, there is no chiral center, and the compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (E)-CH=C(COOCH₃)₂. The two carbons in the double bond are each bonded to a COOCH₃ group and a hydrogen. Since no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, there is no chiral center. The compound does not exhibit optical isomerism, though it may exhibit geometric (cis-trans) isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (option 2) has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism. None of the other compounds analyzed have a chiral center or exhibit optical isomerism. Based on the provided options, none of the choices correctly identify only option 2 as having optical isomerism. However, if forced to select the closest answer, **A) 1, 2, and 4** is incorrect, and **D) 1 and 2** is also incorrect because option 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism. The correct answer is not listed among the options.
