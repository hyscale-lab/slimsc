Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and NMR spectra.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which often indicates O-H stretching, like in a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which supports the idea of a carboxylic acid. Then, the peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H). That's a strong downfield shift, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton. So, that supports the IR indication of a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the other aromatic peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets each integrating to 2H usually mean two substituents in the para positions. Like maybe a substituent on the benzene ring, and another in the meta or para position. Wait, but considering the substituents, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent like a chain attached.

Then there are some lower field peaks. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like next to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be another set of CH2 groups connected to that. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a singlet? No, it's a doublet, which usually indicates a CH2CH3 group, but wait, a doublet for 3H suggests maybe a CH(CH3)2 group, like a geminal substituent. Oh wait, but 1.4 ppm as a doublet maybe indicates a methylene next to a CH? Hmm, maybe it's a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. Alternatively, it could be part of a butyl chain.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain. So, putting this together, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that's a carbonyl group attached to a chain. Wait, because the IR has a C=O at 1720, which is more like a ketone or an acid. Since the NMR shows a broad peak around 10.5 ppm (likely an -OH), it's probably a carboxylic acid.

So, the structure might be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached, along with another substituent. Looking at the substituent, the NMR shows some peaks that suggest a branched chain. Let me try to draw this out.

The 10.5 ppm peak is the -COOH proton. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, so maybe the ring is para-substituted with two groups: one is COOH and the other is an isobutyl group or something similar.

Wait, the other peaks: 2.9 (m,1H) could be a CH that's part of a chain next to the carbonyl. For example, in a structure like -CO-O-R, but if it's -COOH, then perhaps the chain is attached to the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something like that. Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group? Let me think about the NMR shifts.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group next to a carbonyl. So, if the structure is something like Ph-CO-O-R, but wait, the IR shows a carboxylic acid, so it's Ph-COOH. But wait, the NMR only shows one -OH proton, which makes sense for a carboxylic acid. So, the substituent on the benzene is a COOH group, and another substituent which is an alkyl group.

Wait, but the NMR has 8.0 (d,2H), 7.2 (d,2H), so that's two protons each in two doublets. That suggests a para-substituted benzene. Like, in para-substituted benzene, each substituent is in opposite positions, so the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets.

So, the benzene has two substituents: a COOH group and another group. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions.

Now, the substituent besides COOH would be an alkyl group that's causing some splitting in the NMR. The NMR shows peaks at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9.

The 0.9 (t,3H) is likely a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a methyl group adjacent to a CH2, perhaps. Wait, a doublet for 3H at 1.4 suggests a CH2CH(CH3)2 or similar. Alternatively, it might be a methyl group attached to a CH, such as in isobutyl.

Let me think about the options given. The options are all substituents on the benzene ring, some with butyl groups or is
