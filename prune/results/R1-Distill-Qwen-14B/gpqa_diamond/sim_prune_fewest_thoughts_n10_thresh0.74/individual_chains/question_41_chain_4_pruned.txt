Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again. So, there's a light beam going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v, same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. The question is, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer? And the options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when objects are moving relative to each other, especially at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to consider special relativity. But wait, the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, right? But here, the light is in glass, so its speed should be less than c. Wait, but the glass is moving as well. How does that affect things?

Let me think. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. So, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So, from the lab's perspective, how does the light's speed change?

Wait a second, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula comes into play. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity in the original frame, and u' is in the new frame moving at speed v. But wait, here the glass is moving towards the observer. So, I need to think about the direction.
