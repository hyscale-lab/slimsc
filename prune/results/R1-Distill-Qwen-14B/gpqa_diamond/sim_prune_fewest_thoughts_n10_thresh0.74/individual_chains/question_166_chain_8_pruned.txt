Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson in an extended Standard Model. Let me see what I remember.

The problem gives a Lagrangian with some terms. I'll try to parse it. The Lagrangian has terms like i bar(N_R) gamma^mu partial_mu N_R, which looks like a Dirac term for the singlet fermions N_R. Then there's (1/2)(partial phi)^2, so that's the kinetic term for the scalar phi. The term |D^mu S|^2 suggests that S is a scalar doublet because it's covariant derivative squared. The next terms are y_i phi bar(N_iR)^c N_iR^c — wait, the N are right-handed, so their conjugate would be left-handed perhaps? Also, there's a term g_iα bar(N_iR) L_α S. Hmm, L_α is probably a lepton doublet, so this term is like Yukawa coupling for the N's, giving them masses when S gets a vev?

Then there's the potential V(phi, S, H). Wait, but the vev given is ⟨phi⟩² = x² + v², with ⟨phi⟩=x and ⟨h⟩=v. Wait, but the H isn't in the given vev. Oh wait, maybe H is another field. Wait, in the problem statement, the fields are N_iR (singlets), S (scalar doublet), and phi (singlet). So where does H come into play? Hmm, perhaps H is another scalar, maybe another doublet or singlet? Wait, the potential is V(phi, S, H), so H must be another scalar field. Maybe H is an SU(2) doublet, like the Higgs in the Standard Model.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 through radiative corrections. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons come from spontaneous symmetry breaking when the symmetry is broken but there's a custodial symmetry or something that protects some of the Goldstone bosons. In the Standard Model, the Higgs has a vacuum expectation value (vev), and the Goldstone bosons are eaten by the W and Z. But in extensions, like with two Higgs doublets, you might have more fields getting vevs, leading to more Goldstone bosons. However, if some directions in field space are protected by a symmetry (custodial symmetry), then the Goldstone boson in that direction doesn't get eaten and becomes a pseudo-Goldstone, like the Higgs in the Standard Model.

Wait, but in this case, the scalar fields are phi, S, and H. Phi is a singlet with vev x, and H has vev v. So maybe the symmetry breaking is such that H is the main Higgs doublet (like the SM Higgs), and S is another doublet, perhaps a CP-odd or another type. Or maybe S and H are both getting vevs
