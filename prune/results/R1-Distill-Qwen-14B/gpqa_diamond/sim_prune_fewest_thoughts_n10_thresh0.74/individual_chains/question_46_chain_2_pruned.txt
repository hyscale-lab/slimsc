Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me take it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Alright, first, I should probably recall what Grubbs catalyst does. From what I remember, Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, specifically a ruthenium-based one, used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So it's about breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers, so the molecule has a chiral center. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. 3-methyl, so on carbon 3 there's a methyl branch.

So, structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's 5 carbons. Carbon 1: CH2=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), carbon 4: CH2, carbon 5: CH3. Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a 3-methyl, so on carbon 3, there's a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no. Let me think again. Maybe it's 3-methylpent-1-ene: positions 1 to 5. So 1 is the double bond start. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me count: 1 (CH2=), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)), then CH2 and CH3. Yeah, that seems right.

But wait, since it's racemic, that implies the presence of a chiral center. Where is that? Let's see. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH
