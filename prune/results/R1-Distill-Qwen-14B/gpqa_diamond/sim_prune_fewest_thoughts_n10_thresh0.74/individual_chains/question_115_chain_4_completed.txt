Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons colliding and producing photons. Hmm, I need to figure out the angle between the two photons. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are measured as one going upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factors... Lorentz factor gamma is the ratio of the object's velocity to the speed of light, right? So gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). But wait, gamma is actually just the factor by which time dilates or length contracts. So for the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.

But wait, what's the mass of an electron? Oh, right, about 9.1e-31 kg. Positron is the antimatter counterpart, same mass as electron.

So, when they collide and annihilate, they produce two photons. Since they annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into photons. But wait, electrons and positrons have the same rest mass, so their rest energies are the same. So each has rest energy mc², which is about 0.511 MeV each. So together, their rest mass energy would be 1.022 MeV, but maybe that's not directly relevant here.

But wait, the problem says that both photons have the same energy. So the total energy of the system before collision must be converted into the photons. But I think the key here is to consider conservation of momentum and energy.

Wait, but since photons have energy and momentum, but no rest mass, and their momentum is E/c, where E is their energy. So each photon's momentum is E/c in the direction they're moving.

So, let's think about the initial momentum. The electron and positron are moving towards each other on the same horizontal axis. So let's set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-direction, and the positron along the negative x-direction.

Wait, no, the electron is moving from the left, so let's say in the positive x direction. The positron is moving from the right, so in the negative x direction. So their velocities are opposite.

Wait, but their Lorentz factors are given. So the electron's gamma is 4, positron's gamma is 2.

The momentum of each particle is gamma * m * v. But wait, since for relativistic speeds, momentum is gamma*m*v, but v is a significant fraction of c.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute their relativistic momenta in terms of gamma and rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total energy and momentum of the system before collision, and then apply conservation to the photons.

So, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Each has their rest energy plus kinetic energy.

The energy of each particle is gamma * m c². So the total energy would be (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m c². Wait, but the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so perhaps that's a consideration.

Wait no, wait, energy is a scalar, so it's just additive. So the total energy is (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m c².

But wait, wait, no, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, but energy is positive regardless of direction. So I think the total energy is gamma_e * m c² + gamma_p * m c².

Similarly, the momentum is a vector. So the total momentum is gamma_e * m v_e (for electron) plus gamma_p * m v_p (for positron). But the positron's velocity is in the opposite direction, so v_p is negative if v_e is positive.

Wait, maybe I should define the electron's velocity as v_e (to the right), and the positron's velocity as v_p (to the left, so negative direction). So the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m * (-v_p), but wait, wait, wait: the velocity is in the negative x-direction. So the momentum of the positron is gamma_p * m * v_p, where v_p is negative.

Wait, but actually, for the positron moving to the left, its velocity is negative along the x-axis. So its momentum would be gamma_p * m * v_p, where v_p is negative.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate each particle's momentum in terms of gamma.

I remember that for a relativistic particle, the momentum p is gamma * m * v. Also, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v = (pc²)/(gamma m c²) ? Hmm, maybe it's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, think about the relation between momentum and gamma. Another formula is gamma = (pc)/(m c²) * c²? Wait, perhaps I should look for a way to find the momentum in terms of gamma.

Wait, I think the relation is p = gamma * m * v, and since gamma = E/(m c²), E is the total energy, then E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum using the relation p = gamma * m * v.

But I need to find v in terms of gamma. Wait, because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), so (v/c) = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So for the electron, gamma_e =4, so v_e = c * sqrt(1 -1/(4)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.9682 c.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 -1/(2)^2) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (c * sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 0.8660 c.

But wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative. So v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2 ) c.

Now, the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4 c ) = m * sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p = 2 * m * (- sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m * sqrt(3) c.

So the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ).

So that's the initial momentum. Since momentum is conserved, the photons after collision should have a combined momentum equal to that.

But wait, photons have momentum in the direction they're moving. So the two photons' momenta should add up to the initial momentum.

But the problem says that the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So their directions are symmetric in some way. Hmm, but the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So both are moving to the right? Or are they moving in some other way?

Wait, wait, the problem says after the collision, one photon is moving upper-right and another lower-right. So both are to the right, but one is above the x-axis and the other below.

So their momenta are in the same general direction (right), but with some vertical components.

Wait, but the initial momentum was along the x-axis. So the total momentum after collision must also be along the x-axis. Because initial momentum is all along x.

So the sum of the two photons' momenta must have a net y-component of zero, and their x-components must add up to the initial total momentum.

Moreover, since the photons have the same energy, their momenta have the same magnitude (since |p|=E/c for photons). So each photon has the same |p|, but different directions.

Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.

Photons' momenta:

p1 has components (p_x1, p_y1)
p2 has components (p_x2, p_y2)

And since their energies are the same, |p1| = |p2|= E/c = same value.

The sum of the x-components must equal the initial momentum. The sum of the y-components must be zero.

So:

p_x1 + p_x2 = initial momentum (along x)
p_y1 + p_y2 = 0

Now, because the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right, their y-components are in opposite directions. Let's say photon 1 is upper-right, so p_y1 is positive, and photon 2 is lower-right, so p_y2 is negative.

So, p_y1 = - p_y2.

Let me denote p_y1 = a, so p_y2 = -a.

The magnitudes of the momenta:

|p1|^2 = (p_x1)^2 + a^2 = (E/c)^2
|p2|^2 = (p_x2)^2 + (a)^2 = (E/c)^2

So both photons have the same E, so same |p|.

Moreover, the sum of the x-components:

p_x1 + p_x2 = initial_p_x

But since initial_p_x is positive (as we found earlier), and the photons are moving right, their p_x must be positive.

Wait, but photon 2 is going lower-right, so its x-component is positive as well.

So, both p_x1 and p_x2 are positive, but perhaps not the same.

But wait, let me think about the equations.

Let me denote:

p1: (p_x, a)

p2: (q_x, -a)

Because |p1|=|p2|=E/c, we have:

p_x^2 + a^2 = q_x^2 + a^2 → p_x = q_x or p_x = -q_x.

Wait, but since both photons are moving to the right, their x-components must be positive, so p_x = q_x.

So, each photon has the same x-component? That can't be, because then the sum of x-components would be 2 p_x = initial_p_x.

Wait, let's think again.

Wait, |p1| = |p2| → sqrt(p_x1^2 + a^2) = sqrt(p_x2^2 + a^2) → p_x1 = p_x2 or p_x1 = -p_x2.

But since both are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. So p_x1 = p_x2 = p_x.

So, then sum p_x1 + p_x2 = 2 p_x = initial_p_x.

So initial_p_x is (m c)(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ), as we computed earlier.

So, initial_p_x = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Then, 2 p_x = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) → p_x = [ m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.

But each photon has p_x equal to that value, so p_x1 = p_x2 = [ m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that p_x1 and p_x2 are each positive, so adding up to initial_p_x. So that makes sense.

Now, for each photon, their momentum vectors are (p_x, a) and (p_x, -a). So the angle of each photon with the x-axis can be found via tan(theta) = a / p_x.

Let me compute a for each photon.

From |p1| = |p2| = E/c, and E is same for both.

But |p1|^2 = (p_x)^2 + a^2 = (E/c)^2.

But for each photon, their energy is E, so (E/c)^2 is the same.

Wait, but each photon has the same energy, so their p_x and a must satisfy the same equation.

So, for photon 1: a = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - p_x^2 )

Wait, but if both photons have the same p_x, but their a's are same in magnitude but opposite in sign, then the angle each makes with the x-axis is symmetric.

Wait, no, because both have the same p_x and same a magnitude, their angles are symmetric about the x-axis.

So, the two photons are symmetric above and below the x-axis, making the same angle theta.

Wait, but wait, the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles would be theta and -theta, but considering their direction.

Wait, but in terms of the angle between them, it would be 2 theta.

Wait, but the problem is to find the angle between the two photons' directions.

So, if each photon is making an angle theta above and below the x-axis, then the angle between them would be 2 theta.

So, let's compute theta.

We have tan(theta) = a / p_x.

But a can be found from the energy.

Wait, but we need to find the relation between a and p_x.

Wait, but we can get a from the momentum equations.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to consider the conservation of energy.

The total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Energy of electron: gamma_e * m c^2 = 4 m c^2

Energy of positron: gamma_p * m c^2 = 2 m c^2

So total energy before collision is 6 m c².

After collision, the two photons have energy E each, so total energy after is 2 E.

So, 6 m c² = 2 E → E = 3 m c².

So each photon has energy E = 3 m c^2.

So, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is |p| = E/c = 3 m c^2 / c = 3 m c.

Wait, let's write that down:

Each photon's momentum has magnitude |p|=3 m c.

But each photon's x-component is p_x = [ m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.

So, let's compute p_x numerically.

Compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Multiply by m c: m c (2.14093) → p_x = [ m c * 2.14093 ] / 2 ≈ m c * 1.070465.

So, p_x = 1.070465 m c.

But each photon's momentum has magnitude |p| =3 m c.

So, using the equation:

p_x^2 + a^2 = (3 m c)^2 → (1.070465 m c)^2 + a^2 = (3 m c)^2.

Compute (1.070465)^2 ≈ (approx 1.070465)^2 → 1.070465 * 1.070465.

Well, 1.07^2 is about 1.1449, but precise calculation:

1.070465 * 1.070465:

= (1 + 0.070465)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.070465) + (0.070465)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.14093 + 0.004965 ≈ 1.145895.

So, (1.070465 m c)^2 = 1.145895 m^2 c².

So,

a^2 = (3 m c)^2 - (1.070465 m c)^2 = (9 m² c²) - (1.145895 m² c²) = 7.854105 m² c².

Thus, a = sqrt(7.854105) m c ≈ 2.8 m c.

Wait, sqrt(7.854105) is approximately 2.8, since 2.8^2=7.84.

So, a ≈ 2.8 m c.

So, tan(theta) = a / p_x = (2.8 m c) / (1.070465 m c) )= 2.8 / 1.070465 ≈ 2.616.

So, theta = arctan(2.616) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but wait, let me compute arctan(2.616). Because tan(69 degrees) is about 2.605, which is close to 2.616. So, theta is about 69 degrees.

Wait, but wait, the exact value might be a bit higher. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 2.616. Let me think.

tan(69) ≈ 2.605, as I said.

tan(69.5) = approx 2.700.

Wait, 2.616 is between 69 and 70 degrees.

Let me compute tan(69.5 degrees) ≈ 2.699, which is higher than 2.616. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator for tan inverse.

Wait, arctan(2.616) = approximately 69.0 degrees. Because 69 degrees is about 2.605, 69.1 is about 2.613, 69.2 is 2.621. So, 2.616 is about 69.1 degrees.

So, theta is about 69.1 degrees.

So, each photon is at an angle theta above and below the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2 theta → 2 * 69.1 ≈ 138.2 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, which would match this.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the p_x.

Wait, let me double-check the initial momentum.

Electron's momentum p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e.

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e^2 ) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.9682 c.

So, p_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4 ) c = m * sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, positron's v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4 ) = c * sqrt(3/4 ) = (sqrt(3)/2 ) c.

Because it's moving to the left, the momentum is negative.

p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p = 2 * m * ( - sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m sqrt(3) c.

So the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ).

So initial_p_x = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) ≈ m c (3.87298 - 1.73205) ≈ m c (2.14093).

So, p_x for each photon is [2.14093 m c ] / 2 ≈ 1.070465 m c.

So, that part seems correct.

Each photon has |p|=3 m c, so |p|^2 = (3 m c)^2 =9 m² c².

So, p_x^2 + a^2 = (3 m c)^2 → a^2 = 9 m² c² - (1.070465 m c)^2.

Wait, calculating (1.070465)^2 m² c² = 1.145895 m² c².

So a^2 = 9 - 1.145895 → 7.854105 m² c².

Thus, a= sqrt(7.854105) m c ≈ 2.802 m c.

So, tan(theta) = a / p_x = 2.802 / 1.070465 ≈ 2.618.

Wait, 2.802 / 1.070465 ≈ let's compute that.

1.070465 * 2.618 ≈ 2.802? Let me check.

1.070465 * 2.6 = 2.783. 1.070465 * 2.618 ≈ 2.783 + 1.070465*0.018 ≈ 2.783 + 0.0193 ≈ 2.8023. Yes.

So, tan(theta)=2.618. So theta is arctan(2.618). Let me compute this more accurately.

Using a calculator, arctan(2.618) is approximately 69.0 degrees.

Wait, because tan(69) ≈ 2.605, and tan(69.1) is about 2.616, which fits.

So, theta is approximately 69.1 degrees.

So, the angle between the two photons is 2 * 69.1 ≈ 138.2 degrees. The closest option is C) 138 degrees.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons of equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Setup:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_e = 4$.
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_p = 2$.
   - After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy $E$ and symmetric directions (one upper-right, one lower-right).

2. **Conservation Laws**:
   - **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before collision equals the total energy after collision.
   - **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before collision equals the total momentum after collision.

3. **Initial Momentum**:
   - The momentum of the electron is $p_e = \gamma_e m v_e$, where $v_e = c \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma_e^2}$. For $\gamma_e = 4$, $v_e \approx 0.9682c$, so $p_e = m c \sqrt{15}$.
   - The momentum of the positron is $p_p = \gamma_p m v_p$, where $v_p = -c \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma_p^2}$. For $\gamma_p = 2$, $v_p \approx -0.8660c$, so $p_p = -m c \sqrt{3}$.
   - Total initial momentum:  
     $$p_{\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).$$

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - Each photon has energy $E = 3m c^2$ (from energy conservation: total energy before collision is $6m c^2$, so $2E = 6m c^2$).
   - The magnitude of each photon's momentum is $|p| = E/c = 3m c$.
   - Let the photons have momenta $\vec{p}_1 = (p_x, a)$ and $\vec{p}_2 = (p_x, -a)$, where $p_x$ is the $x$-component and $a$ is the $y$-component.

5. **Photon Momentum Components**:
   - From $|\vec{p}|^2 = p_x^2 + a^2$, we have:
     $$p_x^2 + a^2 = (3m c)^2.$$
   - From momentum conservation, the total $x$-momentum is:
     $$p_x + p_x = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \implies 2p_x = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \implies p_x = \frac{m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})}{2}.$$

6. **Solve for $a$**:
   - Substituting $p_x$ into $p_x^2 + a^2 = (3m c)^2$:
     $$a^2 = (3m c)^2 - \left(\frac{m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})}{2}\right)^2.$$
   - Compute $p_x^2$:
     $$p_x^2 = \left(\frac{m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})}{2}\right)^2 = m^2 c^2 \frac{(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})^2}{4} = m^2 c^2 \frac{15 + 3 - 2\sqrt{45}}{4} = m^2 c^2 \frac{18 - 6\sqrt{5}}{4}.$$
   - Simplify $a^2$:
     $$a^2 = 9m^2 c^2 - m^2 c^2 \frac{18 - 6\sqrt{5}}{4} = m^2 c^2 \left(9 - \frac{18 - 6\sqrt{5}}{4}\right) = m^2 c^2 \frac{36 - 18 + 6\sqrt{5}}{4} = m^2 c^2 \frac{18 + 6\sqrt{5}}{4}.$$
   - Thus:
     $$a = m c \sqrt{\frac{18 + 6\sqrt{5}}{4}} = m c \frac{\sqrt{18 + 6\sqrt{5}}}{2}.$$

7. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The angle $\theta$ each photon makes with the $x$-axis satisfies:
     $$\tan\theta = \frac{a}{p_x}.$$
   - Substituting $a$ and $p_x$:
     $$\tan\theta = \frac{\sqrt{18 + 6\sqrt{5}}/2}{(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})/2} = \frac{\sqrt{18 + 6\sqrt{5}}}{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}.$$
   - Simplify $\tan\theta$ numerically:
     - $\sqrt{15} \approx 3.87298$, $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205$, $\sqrt{18 + 6\sqrt{5}} \approx 2.8$.
     - $\tan\theta \approx \frac{2.8}{1.070465} \approx 2.616$.
   - Compute $\theta$:
     $$\theta = \arctan(2.616) \approx 69.1^\circ.$$
   - The angle between the photons is $2\theta \approx 2 \times 69.1^\circ = 138.2^\circ$.

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is approximately **138 degrees**.

**Answer: C**
