Okay, so I've got this question about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. I think it's related to the Boltzmann distribution, which deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium. Right, because the problem states that the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that's the key here.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level is about twice as high in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I remember that the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, in this case, we're comparing two stars. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) will depend on their respective temperatures. Let me think. For star 1 and star 2, the ratio of the excited to ground (or another) state is n1 and n2 respectively.

Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, n1 = 2 * n2? Or wait, no. Let me read it again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So I think that means that the number of excited atoms in that level is twice as much for star_1 as for star_2. So n1 (excited) is 2 n2 (excited). But wait, maybe it's the ratio of the excited to the lower state. So, if for each star, the ratio is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2 (for star_1) and 1 (for star_2), but wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2 in the same energy level. Hmm, maybe the ratio between the excited and lower states is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, maybe each
