Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me start by recalling what I know about qPCR and calibration curves.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it serially and ran qPCR with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which means the reaction is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. An R² of 1 means the data fits the curve perfectly, so no issues there. The slope of the curve is -3.3. 

Wait, the slope in qPCR is usually -3.32 if I remember right, because the formula for efficiency is E = 10^(-1/slope). Since efficiency is 100%, E is 1, so 1 = 10^(-1/s), which would mean s = -3.32, approximately. So the slope here is about right.

Now looking at the data points. Each concentration has three Ct values. Let's see:

At 100,000 copies: Ct values 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is about 34.2, right?
At 10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average ~30.9.
At 1000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Average ~27.6.
At 100: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Average 24.3.
At 10: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Average ~21.

Wait, but the concentrations are being diluted ten-fold each time. So from 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10-fold decrease. Similarly each step down is a tenth of the previous.

But in qPCR, each ten-fold dilution should lead to a decrease of about 3.3 cycles, right? Because with 100% efficiency, each cycle doubles the DNA. So 10-fold is log2(10) ≈ 3.32 cycles. So from a higher concentration to a lower one, you'd expect the Ct to increase by about 3.3. Let's check the differences between the averages.

From 100,000 (34.2) to 10,000 (30.9): the difference is about 3.3. That's good. Next, from 10,000 (30.9) to 1,000 (27.6): again a 3.3 drop. Same for 1,000 to 100 (27.6 to 24.3, which is 3.3). 100 to 10 (24.3 to 21): that's a decrease of 3.3 as well.

Wait, but the Ct values are the opposite? Or wait, no. Wait, the Ct is lower when there's more DNA because it takes fewer cycles to reach the threshold. So higher concentration (like 100,000) should have lower Ct. Wait, no! Wait, the Ct is the cycle number at which the fluorescence crosses the threshold. So more DNA means it reaches the threshold sooner, so a lower Ct. Oh wait, wait, in the data, when the concentration is higher, the Ct is lower. Wait no, looking at the data: 100,000 is 34.2, and 10,000 is 30.9. Oh wait, that's lower Ct for higher concentration. Because higher concentration has more starting DNA, so reaches threshold earlier, lower Ct.
