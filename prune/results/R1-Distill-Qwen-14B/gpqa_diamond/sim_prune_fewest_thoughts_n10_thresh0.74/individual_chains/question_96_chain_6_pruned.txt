Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ=10^-17 degrees, and it's at a distance d=10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula must be something like S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, G is Newton's constant, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Oh right, I think the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * (1/(k)) where l_p is the Planck length. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up some constants. Let me get that right.

Wait, the correct formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k). Or another way, since I remember the area formula. Oh, right, the area A relates to the radius of the event horizon. The event horizon radius R is 2 G M / c^2. So, area A would be 4 π R², which is 4 π (2 G M / c²)^2. 

But wait, maybe I can find the mass M first
