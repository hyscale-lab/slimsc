Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Ignoring their spin, the coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, I remember that the notation is |l1, l2, l, m> where l1 and l2 are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, l is the total orbital angular momentum, and m is its projection along a particular axis, like the z-axis.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give -침.

So, each electron has an orbital angular momentum L with quantum number l=1 for a p orbital. The eigenvalues for Lz are m multiplied by 침. So for each electron, Lz can be -침, 0, or +침 because m can be -1, 0, +1.

But wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. Let me break this down. The total orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 2. Since each electron has l1=1 and l2=1, their sum can be l=2 or l=0 or l=1? Wait, no, when combining two angular momenta l1 and l2, the possible l values are |l1-l2| to l1+l2, so 0, 1,
