Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy delta E of a hydrogen atom. The magnetic field B is given as 1 Tesla and is parallel to the Oz axis. They also mention small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Hmm, I remember that m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, but wait, for s orbitals, m is zero. Oh, but the question says small values, so maybe m=0 or ±1.

Wait, the problem is about paramagnetic coupling. Paramagnetic substances have electrons that are attracted to a magnetic field due to the alignment of their spins. But in this context, I think it's about the Zeeman effect. Oh right, the Zeeman effect is when an atom's energy levels split in a magnetic field. So the paramagnetic coupling term is probably the Zeeman energy.

The transition energy delta E is given, and the wavelength lambda is 0.4861 micrometers. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to wavelength by delta E = hc / lambda. Let me think: h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So first, I need to calculate delta E. Let's get the numbers right. Lambda is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. Because 1 micrometer is 1000 nm, so 0.4861 * 1000 = 486.1 nm.

The energy delta E is hc over lambda. Let me remember the values. h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is 3 x 10^8 m/s. So hc would be 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = about 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by lambda in meters.

Wait, lambda is 486.1 nm, which is 486.1e-9 meters. So hc / lambda is (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (486.1e-9 m) = let me compute that. 1.9878e-25 divided by 486.1e-9 is approximately 4.09e-18 J. But wait, maybe I should convert that into electron volts because I'm more familiar with energy scales in eV. I know 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.09e-18 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is about 25.5 eV. Hmm, that's the energy delta E.

Wait, but wait, in hydrogen, the transition from n=3 to n=2 is about the Balmer series. The energy levels for hydrogen are given by delta E = E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So the transition energy from n=2 to n=3 would be E2 - E3 = ( -13.6 /4 ) - ( -13.6 /9 ) = (-3.4) + 1.511 = -1.889 eV. Hmm, but I'm getting 25 eV when I calculate from the wavelength. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the delta E. Let me compute hc/(lambda) again. Let me do this step by step.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value as per SI)
c = 2.99792458e8 m/s (exact)
lambda = 486.1 nm = 486.1e-9 m

So hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = let's compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. But more accurately, 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = approximately 1.98644586e-25 J·m.

So delta E = hc / lambda = 1.98644586e-25 J·m / 486.1e-9 m = 1.98644586e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ (1.98644586 / 4.861) * 1e-18 J. Let's compute 1.9864 / 4.861 ≈ 0.409. So 0.409e-18 J, which is 4.09e-19 J. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the exponent. So 486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 meters. So the denominator is 4.861e-7 m, so 1e-25 divided by 1e-7 is 1e-18. So 1.986e-25 /4.861e-7 = (1.986/4.861) *
