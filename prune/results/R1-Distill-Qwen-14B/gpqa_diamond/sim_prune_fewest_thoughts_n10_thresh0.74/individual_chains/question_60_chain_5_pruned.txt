Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's see. The question is about an alien astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at a speed very close to the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective.

Wait, right, because of relativity, time dilation affects the astronaut's experienced time. Oh right, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to c, so the time experienced onboard would be much less than what someone on Earth would observe.

Let me think about the formula here. I remember that time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, since the astronaut is on the spacecraft, they'll experience less time—so the proper time tau is equal to the Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right?

Wait, no, wait. From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted. Because in their frame of reference, Earth is moving towards them at that high speed. So the distance would be shorter than what we on Earth would measure.

Wait, but the problem says they are from the Large Magellanic Cloud. How far is that from Earth? Oh wait, I don't think the actual distance is given. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, so we can approach this using either time dilation or length contraction.

Let me try to break this down. Let's say the distance from the LMC to Earth is D as measured from Earth. But the astronaut's ship is moving at v = 0.99999987*c. So from Earth's perspective, the time taken is t = D / v. But from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted, so they would experience the time as tau = (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v. Because length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (from Earth's frame). So astronaut's frame sees L = D * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Alternatively, using time dilation
