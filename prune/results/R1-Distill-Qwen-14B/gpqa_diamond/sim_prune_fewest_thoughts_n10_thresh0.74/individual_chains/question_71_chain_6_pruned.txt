Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, right? I think that's a method where the timing of when a planet transits (passes in front of) its star changes because of the gravitational influence of other planets. But I don't think that part is super relevant here; the key is about their orbital periods and equilibrium temperatures.

The planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest. They're asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature? Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula, if I recall correctly, is T = T_star * (L_star/(16πσd^2))^1/4 or something like that. Alternatively, another way I've heard it is T ∝ (L/(d^2))^1/4, where L is the star's luminosity and d is the distance.

But wait, since all the planets are around the same star, L and σ (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) would be the same for each planet. So the equilibrium temperature should depend only on the distance from the star. The farther the planet is, the cooler it is, so the temperature ratio would be proportional to (d1/d2)^0.25 or something like that.

Wait, no, because temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Let me think again. The inverse square law for radiation, but since the planet is a blackbody, the power absorbed is L/(16πd²) — wait, I might be getting confused. Let me recall the formula for equilibrium temperature.

The formula I think is T = T_eff * ( (1 - albedo) / (2 (1 + e)) )^0.5 * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), where a is the semi-major axis, e is the eccentricity. Oh wait, but in this case, the orbits are circular, so
