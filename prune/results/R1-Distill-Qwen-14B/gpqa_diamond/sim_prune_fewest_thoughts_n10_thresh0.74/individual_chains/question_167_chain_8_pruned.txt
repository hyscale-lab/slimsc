Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc., and non-Gaussian states are the ones that can't be described by Gaussian statistics. The cat state is a superposition of coherent states, so it's definitely non-Gaussian.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant. The normalization is given as N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). So I have to plug in phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5 into this.

First, let me compute N. Let's see, phi is -pi/4. So sin(2*phi) would be sin(-pi/2) which is -1. And exp(-2*alpha^2) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065. Wait, but N is the square root of 1 plus this. So 1 - 0.6065 is about 0.3935. The square root of 0.3935 is approximately 0.6275. So N is around 0.6275.

Next, the relative entropy measure is given as delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Wait, but wait, relative entropy usually is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Oh, but here it's written as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Hmm, maybe that's the case. So this would be the sum of the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau. Wait, but normally, relative entropy is cross entropy minus entropy. Hmm, perhaps in this context, they're using a different measure. So I'll proceed as per the formula given.

So I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) as delta_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Because tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a specific one, maybe the closest Gaussian state to rho.

But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state tau here? The problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. For a Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the closest Gaussian state would be a statistical mixture of those two coherent states if the state were a mixture, but it's a pure state here. So perhaps the reference state is a coherent state, or maybe the state with the same expectation values but Gaussian?

Wait, maybe the reference
