Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what I remember from my studies.

The question is about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and its proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. They ask for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are given as A to D, with varying units.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame observes a longer lifetime because the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

The formula for time dilation is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe the decays. Oh right, the resolution refers to the detection system's ability to measure the position where the decay occurs. So particles moving quickly might travel a certain distance before decaying, and the detector needs to have a good enough resolution to pinpoint that position.

I think the resolution relates to the uncertainty in the position. To detect the decay, the particle must travel a distance that is within the detector's resolution. If the detector's resolution is too poor, it can't distinguish the decay point from the production point, making it hard to observe the decay.

So the key here is finding the minimum distance the particle travels before decaying, and then the detector's resolution must be better than that to observe the decay. The minimum distance would correspond to the particle having the maximum possible speed for the given energy, but wait, energy is related to the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The lifetime observed in the lab frame is τ = γτ₀. The distance the particle travels before decaying is L = vτ. But v is approximately c for high-energy particles, so L ≈ cτ.

But wait, the energy given is 27 GeV. That's the kinetic energy plus the rest mass, I think. Wait, no. Wait, the energy E of a particle is the total energy, which is γm₀c². So E = γm₀c².

Given that, since E is 27 GeV and m₀c² is 3.41 GeV (because the mass is 3.41 GeV/c², so m₀c² is 3.41 GeV), so E = γ * 3.41 GeV = 27 GeV.

Solving for γ: γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately... let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 *7.9 ≈ 27 (because 3.41 * 8 = 27.28
