Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, particles are being collided in a detector, and some of them reach the inner walls. The question is about finding the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of them to reach the walls instead of one third.

Alright, let me start by understanding the given information. The detector is spherical with a radius of 30 meters. When particles are produced, they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. Now, we need to find what Lorentz factor would make it so that two-thirds reach the walls.

Wait, I think this has to do with time dilation or the lifetime of the particles from the detector's frame versus the particle's rest frame. Because the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab (detector) frame would be longer due to time dilation. 

So, the particles are moving outward from the center of the detector. The time they take to reach the wall depends on their speed. If their lifetime (as measured in the lab) is just enough for them to reach the wall, then only a fraction of them would do so, depending on their speed and the time they live.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that one third reach the walls at a Lorentz factor of 20. We need to find the factor for when two-thirds reach. So I guess the fraction depends on how much their lifetime is compared to the time it takes to reach the wall.

Let me think about the proper lifetime. The proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So if the lab frame observes the lifetime as gamma times the proper lifetime (tau), then the time the particle has to reach the wall is tau multiplied by gamma.

The time to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. The detector radius is 30 meters. At ultra-relativistic speeds, the velocity is approximately c, so the time t is approximately R/(c) = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds? Wait, wait, let me calculate that. 30 divided by 3e8 is 1e-7 seconds, yes.

But wait, maybe it's better to express it in terms of gamma. Because the proper lifetime is tau, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, but how does this relate to the fraction of particles reaching the detector? Oh right, the fraction depends on whether their lifetime is sufficient for them to reach the wall. If the lifetime is longer than the time to reach the wall, then particles may decay before reaching, or after.

Wait, perhaps the number of particles that decay before reaching the wall depends on the ratio of the time to reach the wall compared to their lifetime.

So, the probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall would be (t / gamma tau). If t is the time to reach the wall, and gamma tau is their lifetime. So the probability of decay before reaching is (t) / (gamma tau).

But wait, in the first case, when gamma is 20, and one third reach the wall, that implies that two-thirds decay before reaching. So the fraction that reach the wall is (1 - t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3.

Wait, that makes sense. So, fraction reaching = 1 - ( t / (gamma tau) )

Because if t is the time to reach the wall, then the probability that the particle lives long enough is 1 - (t/(gamma tau)).

So in the first scenario, gamma is 20, and fraction reaching is 1/3. So:

1/3 = 1 - ( t / (20 tau) )

Which implies that t/(20 tau) = 2/3.

So t = (2/3) * 20 tau = (40/3) tau.

Wait, but wait, t is the time to reach the wall, which is R/(beta c). Because beta is v/c, for ultra-relativistic particles, beta is approximately 1, but perhaps we can assume beta is 1 for simplicity?

Wait, but if beta is not exactly 1, but very close, then perhaps beta is 1. But the problem states that they are traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities, so beta is very close to 1. So, for the sake of calculation, perhaps we can approximate beta as 1.

So, t = R/(beta c) ≈ R/c = 30 m / 3e8 m/s = 1e-7 seconds, as I thought earlier.

So, t = 1e-7 s.

But in terms of tau, the proper lifetime, we have:

t = (1e-7) s = (2/3) * (20 tau) 

Wait, no, earlier I had t = (2/3) * (20 tau) because from t/(20 tau) = 2/3.

So, solving:

t = (2/3) * 20 tau => tau = t * 3 / (40) 

Wait, wait, let me re-express that. From t/(20 tau) = 2/3, rearrange to tau = t * 3 / (40).

So tau = t * 3 / 40.

But t is 1e-7 s.

Wait, but tau is the proper lifetime, and t is the time in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation as:

fraction_reaching = 1 - ( t / (gamma tau) )

So in the first case, 1/3 = 1 - (t/(20 tau)) → 2/3 = t/(20 tau) → t = (40/3) tau → tau = (3 t)/(40).

So tau = (3 * 1e-7) / 40 ≈ 7.5e-9 seconds.

Hmm. But that's the proper lifetime. Now, the question is what gamma would make the fraction reaching to be 2/3.

So, in the new case, fraction_reaching = 2/3. So:

2/3 = 1 - t/(gamma_new tau)

Which simplifies to:

t/(gamma_new tau) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 → gamma_new tau = 3 t.

But from the previous calculation, tau is (3 t)/(40). So substituting:

gamma_new * (3 t /40 ) = 3 t → gamma_new = (3 t ) / ( (3 t /40) ) ) → gamma_new = 40.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me redo that.

Wait, tau = (3 t ) / (40) → from the first case.

So, substituting into gamma_new tau = 3 t:

gamma_new * (3 t /40) ) = 3 t 

Divide both sides by 3 t:

gamma_new / 40 = 1 → gamma_new =40.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So the Lorentz factor would be 40.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is 40. So that would be the answer. Hmm.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because the time to reach the wall is t = R/(beta gamma c) ?

Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake in the expression of t.

Wait, the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the particle's speed. The distance is R, which is 30 meters. The particle's speed is beta c. So t = R/(beta c). But since beta is very close to 1, we can approximate t ≈ R/c.

Wait, but in terms of gamma, we can write beta gamma as (v/c) * gamma.

Wait, but for ultra-relativistic particles, gamma is approximately the same as 1/(beta sqrt(1 - beta^2)), but perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, maybe another approach. The proper lifetime tau is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame observes a longer lifetime, gamma tau.

The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t= R/(beta c).

For the particle to reach the wall, its lifetime must be at least t. So the fraction that reaches is the number of particles whose lifetime in the lab frame is greater than t.

Assuming the decay follows an exponential distribution, the probability that a particle lives longer than t is exp(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma tau.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Another approach is considering that the fraction reaching is the probability that the particle doesn't decay before traveling R.

The time to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c).

The proper lifetime is tau, and the lab lifetime is gamma tau.

The probability that the particle doesn't decay before time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but that's if the decay is exponential. So the fraction reaching the wall would be exp( -t/(gamma tau) )

Wait, but in the first scenario, this fraction is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp( - t/(20 tau) )

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau ) → t/(20 tau) = ln(3) → t = 20 tau ln(3)

Wait, that's a different approach. Hmm. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the decay follows an exponential process. The number of particles that decay before time t is 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma tau.

So the fraction that reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

So in the first case, when gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp( -t/(20 tau) )

Take ln: ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau) → t/(20 tau) = ln(3) → t = 20 tau ln(3)

Then, for the second case, we need the fraction to be 2/3. So:

2/3 = exp(- t/(gamma_new tau) )

Take ln: ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma_new tau) → t/(gamma_new tau) = ln(3/2) → t = gamma_new tau * ln(3/2)

But we know that from the first case, t =20 tau ln(3). So substituting:

20 tau ln(3) = gamma_new tau ln(3/2 )

Cancel tau:

20 ln(3) = gamma_new ln(3/2 )

So gamma_new = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2 )

Compute that.

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So gamma_new ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ (21.972) / 0.4055 ≈ 54.14.

Hmm, so the Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54, which is option A.

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier approach. So which approach is correct?

I think the correct approach is the exponential decay one because that's how radioactive decay works. The probability of decay before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

So in the first scenario, when gamma is 20, fraction reaching is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp( - t/(20 tau) )

So solving for t in terms of tau.

Then, when we need the fraction to be 2/3, that equation gives us gamma_new.

So the correct calculation leads to gamma_new ≈54, which is option A.

So I think the initial approach was incorrect because it didn't model the exponential decay correctly.

So the answer should be A, 54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the problem using the exponential decay model. The fraction of particles that reach the walls is given by:

\[
\text{Fraction reaching} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where \( t \) is the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Relating \( t \), \( \gamma \), and \( \tau \) for the first case
For the initial scenario, the Lorentz factor is \( \gamma = 20 \), and the fraction of particles reaching the wall is \( \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{20 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{20 \tau}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{t}{20 \tau} = \ln(3).
\]

Thus:

\[
t = 20 \tau \ln(3).
\]

### Step 2: Relating \( t \), \( \gamma \), and \( \tau \) for the second case
For the second case, the fraction of particles reaching the wall is \( \frac{2}{3} \). Using the same equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Thus:

\[
t = \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

### Step 3: Equating the two expressions for \( t \)
From the first case, \( t = 20 \tau \ln(3) \). Substituting this into the second case:

\[
20 \tau \ln(3) = \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Cancel \( \tau \):

\[
20 \ln(3) = \gamma_{\text{new}} \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Solve for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \):

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 4: Numerical calculation
Using approximate values:
- \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \),
- \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \),

we calculate:

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \times 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx \frac{21.972}{0.4055} \approx 54.14.
\]

### Final Answer
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately \( 54 \), which corresponds to option **A**.
