Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star they orbit and their distance. But wait, it's been a while since I studied this. Let me think.

So the question says there are five exoplanets in orbital resonance, discovered via the TTV method. Their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Oh right, TTV is transit timing variations, which I think is a method to detect planets by the changes in when they transit their star. But maybe that's not super relevant here, since the main point is about their orbital periods.

They're asking about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that factor won't change the ratio. Equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, right? The formula I remember is something like T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, maybe it's more accurate to think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is usually T = T_star * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but wait, that might be when considering the star's luminosity. Alternatively, another version is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), assuming the planet is at distance a from the star. But perhaps I should think about the proportionality here since the star is the same for all planets, so the ratio will depend only on the ratio of their distances.

Since all planets have the same star, their equilibrium temperatures are inversely proportional to the square root of their orbital periods. Wait, no—wait, the distance a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Remember that T^2 is proportional to a^3, right? So a = (T^2 * (G M / (4π²)) )^(1/3), but since M (the star's mass) is the same for all, the period is proportional to a^(3/2). So a is proportional to T^(2/3).

So the distance a is proportional to T^(2/3), but for the equilibrium temperature, which depends on 1/(sqrt(a)), right? Because the flux from the
