Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me read it again. Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

First, let's break down the information given. The two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But I'm not sure if their masses will affect the elemental ratios directly. Maybe it's a red herring, or maybe it's about something else like stellar evolution, but the question is specifically about elemental abundances determined using the EW method, so perhaps mass isn't directly relevant here. I'll focus on the abundance data provided.

The given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → so log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5

Wait, but how does this help? I think I need to find the [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] for each star, and then find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen in each, and then take the ratio.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2?

Let me think step by step.

First, for each star, I need to find [Si/H], then take the ratio.

Starting with Star_1.

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. Since it's 0, Fe abundance is same as solar. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance is solar.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. So Si relative to Fe is 0.3 dex higher than solar.

Wait, no. The notation [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

I can write nSi/nFe for Star_1 as 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun.

Since nFe for Star
