Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions, and we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, let's go through the reactions one by one.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking, what would form a bright red product? Maybe something like sulfur reacting, but sulfur is typically yellow. Oh wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction forming a compound like copper(II) sulfate, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: maybe the product C is SO3^2- or something else. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving lead, but that's more yellow. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or something else. Wait, the product C is used further.

Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like a gas that's highly reactive, maybe chlorine or something else. Wait, but the first reaction uses gas B. Let's think: if B is a gas, perhaps it's something like O2, Cl2, H2, or maybe CO2. Hmm.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A and produce two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids include H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, etc. Weak acids are like H3PO4, CH3COOH, etc. So, if C plus water gives A plus F and G, perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces these acids.

Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something like DMSO. Wait, if B is O2, then reacting with D (maybe H2?) would form H2O, but that's a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is another gas like Cl2, and D is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is something else.

Wait, let's try to piece this together.

Looking at the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. If A is a metal, perhaps,
