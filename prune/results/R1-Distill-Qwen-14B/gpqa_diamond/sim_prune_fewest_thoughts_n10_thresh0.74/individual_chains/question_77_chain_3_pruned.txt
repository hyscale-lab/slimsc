Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and some other reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So I need to figure out what happens when BuLi and then H+ are added. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, so that's probably deprotonating something. 

Looking at the structure, ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an oxygen connected to a methyl group and a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Let me draw that: it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, so the substituent on the oxygen is OCH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

So the molecule is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

BuLi is a strong base, so it will abstract a proton. Where's the acidic proton here? In such systems, allylic protons are more acidic. Let me see, the structure has a double bond between C2 and C3 of the butenyl group. The OCH2 is attached to C1, then C2 is double bonded to C3, which is connected to a methyl group.

So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. The allylic protons would be on the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond. So the CH2 next to the double bond is OCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, the O is attached to CH2, which is attached to C(CH3)=CH2. So the CH2 is between O and the double bond. So the protons on that CH2 might be acidic.

So when BuLi is added, it could deprotonate that CH2. Let's say it abstracts a proton from the CH2, making it O-CH- which is deprotonated, forming an enolate or something. Then, what happens when you add H+? Well, after deprotonation, perhaps a rearrangement occurs, but wait, the question says BuLi followed by H+. Oh, but maybe the reaction is a Cope rearrangement?

Wait, the Cope rearrangement is for 1,5-dienes. Wait, the starting material for part A isn't a 1,5-diene. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe after deprotonation, it forms a conjugated diene that can undergo a Cope rearrangement.

Wait, the starting material is OCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So that's an allyl ether. Hmm, another possibility: when BuLi is added, perhaps it induces a conjugate addition or some kind of base-initiated rearrangement.

Hold on, I think I'm mixing things up. Let's think: The Cope
