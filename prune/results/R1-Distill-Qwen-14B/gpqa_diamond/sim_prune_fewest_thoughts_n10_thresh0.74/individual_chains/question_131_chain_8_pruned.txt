Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR questions can get tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid that's been dehydrated into an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products. The products have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. Their NOESY NMR spectra show a difference: the major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, let's go through what's given. The starting material is a cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration of a diacid usually forms an anhydride. For a cis-alkene, when it dehydrates, the geometry might influence the structure of the anhydride. Wait, but dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride, but if the starting alkene is cis, the resulting anhydride's structure could depend on the arrangement.

The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR. A single peak usually implies no neighboring hydrogens. Maybe it's a carbonyl group? Wait, no. Wait, but 7 ppm is more like a methylene group maybe? Or perhaps an aromatic? No, wait, the options have singlets around 1 ppm, which are likely methyl groups attached to something that deshields them a bit. Hmm, perhaps it's an aromatic proton. Or maybe it's a CH that's in an environment with no neighbors. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 that's split into a singlet, but that's less common unless symmetry makes them equivalent.

Wait, another thought: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That could be a proton that's not split because it's equivalent. Maybe in a cyclic structure, like a five-membered ring where the protons are all equivalent. Wait, but the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is probably a carbon with some electronegative substituents or part of a conjugated system, maybe a double bond. 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon, like an ester or anhydride.

Wait, the anhydride's structure must have two carbonyl groups. Anhydrides typically have two carbonyls. So, in the 13C NMR, why only two peaks? Because of symmetry. If the anhydride has two identical carbonyl groups, perhaps due to symmetrical substitution, then the two carbonyls would be at the same ppm. But wait, the 13C shows two peaks. Hmm, maybe one is a carbonyl (like an anhydride oxygen) and another is an sp2 carbon, like a double bond. Because in the 1H NMR, the
