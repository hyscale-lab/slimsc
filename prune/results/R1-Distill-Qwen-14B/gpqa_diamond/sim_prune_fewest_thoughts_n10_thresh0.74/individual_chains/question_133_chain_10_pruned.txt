Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains two different phosphate salts. The solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. There's 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH, so this probably involves some buffer calculations or understanding of the dissociation steps.

Wait, the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, no, orthophosphate is actually H3PO4 in its fully protonated form. But when it dissociates, it goes through several stages. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), then H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). Orthophosphate usually refers to the H3PO4, but sometimes people might refer to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate? Hmm, maybe I need to double-check that.

Wait, no, I think orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-? Or wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, but when it loses all three protons, it becomes PO4^3-. So in solution, the various species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2- because that's the form that comes from the salts here.

Looking at the salts: KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its dissociation would give K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The other salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissociates, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, right? So the solution contains H2PO4^- and H
