Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. But wait, what's a synchrocyclotron? Oh right, it's a type of cyclotron that uses a varying magnetic field to keep the particles in sync with the electric field for acceleration as they spiral out. So the particles make revolutions while getting pushed by the electric field.

The question says a proton is injected at time t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Or does it mean it goes through two stages or something? I'm not sure about that part.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data provided is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

I think I need to find the number of times the proton revolves around the synchrocyclotron as it's accelerated. Each revolution would correspond to a certain energy gain, I guess. But wait, how does the voltage relate to the energy gain?

Wait, in cyclotrons, the electric field does work on the particle as it moves through the gap between the dees. The energy gained per revolution depends on the voltage applied. But since it's a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field isn't
