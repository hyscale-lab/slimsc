Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear reactions and quantum numbers. Hmm, let's see. The question is about two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which I know is a specific term symbol. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), right? So for 1S0, that would mean 2S+1 = 1, so S=0. L is S, so L=0, and J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the initial system is NN in 1S0, and they emit X. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused about that equation. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. The equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2?

Wait, the problem says "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy..." So the final state's T(NN) is equal to S(NN) + L(NN) +1, modulo 2.

The final NN state has T(NN) =0. So if T=0, then 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. Because 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 → S+L+1 ≡0 → S+L ≡1.

So S and L must be such that their sum is odd. Let's remember that.

Now, particle X is emitted. So the total angular momentum, isospin, and parity must be conserved? Or wait, the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

Wait, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So each option is an initial state (1S0) emitting X into a final state. The options have the form like 7D1 + p, which probably means that the NN state is in a certain state and X is p (proton? Or maybe another particle).

So for each option, I need to check the angular momentum and parity conservation.

Let me break it down. The initial state has J=0, since it's 1S0. The emitted particle X has angular momentum l, and the final NN state has angular momentum L'. The total angular momentum must be conserved. But wait, the process is that the initial state (NN) emits X, so the total angular momentum of the system (NN + X) before emission is J =0. After emission, the NN has L' and the X has l. So L' and l must add up to 0. Because J_initial = 0, so J_final = L' + l =0. So L' must equal -l, but since angular momentum is quantized, L' and l must be such that their
