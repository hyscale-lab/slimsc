Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me jot that down: C9H11NO2. So that's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens.

First, looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which are in the medium to strong intensity range. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, the compound has a molecular formula with one N and two O's. So possibilities could be amides, esters, maybe an amine or a phenol. But the 1720 cm-1 peak is strong. That's a strong carbonyl stretch. Typically, that's a C=O group. So, maybe an amide, ester, ketone, or maybe an acid derivative.

Let me think. In IR, amides usually show a very strong N-H stretch around 3300 cm-1, maybe even two bands. Esters have a C=O around 1740-1720 cm-1. So the 1720 cm-1 is right in the ester range. But wait, the amide carbonyl is a bit lower, around 1650. So maybe it's an ester? Or could it be another carbonyl-containing group.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. That would have an amide group, so the carbonyl would be around 1650. But our IR shows 1720, which is higher, more like an ester. So perhaps A is less likely.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Also an amide, so same as A, the carbonyl would be lower. But wait, formamide generally has a carbonyl around 1680. So 1720 would be higher than that. So maybe B isn't right either.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That's a propionamide, perhaps? Or wait, propionate would be an ester group. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2COO- attached to a benzene ring with an amine. The carbonyl here would be an ester, which matches the 1720. And the amine would have N-H stretches. But the IR shows two peaks in the 3400s, which could be N-H from an amide or an amine. Alternatively, maybe it's an O-H stretch, but that's less likely here because the formula doesn't have a hydroxyl group. Oh wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So O is two, N one. So maybe an ester and an amine group?

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be a benzoate ester. The structure would be OEt attached to the carbonyl, connected to a benzene ring that has an amino group in the para position. So the carbonyl is an ester, which fits the 1720 cm-1. The amine would have N-H stretches. So the IR would show peaks around 3300-3400 for N-H. So that's possible.

So the IR suggests a carbonyl group, likely an ester, given the 1720. So options C and D are more likely because they have ester groups. A and B are amides, which would have lower carbonyl peaks.

Now onto the NMR data. Let's look at each part.

The 1H NMR has the following signals:
