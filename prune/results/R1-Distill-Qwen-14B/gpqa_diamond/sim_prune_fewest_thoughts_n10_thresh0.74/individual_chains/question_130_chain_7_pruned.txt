Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space and how they absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, redshift basics. Redshift (z) tells us how much the wavelength of light has stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula I remember is the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). Right.

So, Lyman alpha emission is at about 1216 Angstroms. But wait, I think Lyman alpha is actually a rest wavelength. Oh, wait, Lyman alpha is a transition in hydrogen that emits at about 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So the emitted wavelength is 1216 A.

Now, these clouds absorb this wavelength. So the quasar emits light, and when that light passes through the hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs it at 1216 A. But when the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), the absorption line is redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 A.

But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So what's the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can see? Because if the observed wavelength is beyond what optical telescopes can detect, we won't see it.

Wait, optical wavelengths are from about 380 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red), right? So 750 nm is the upper limit. Let me convert that to Angstroms. 750 nm is 7500 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength can't be longer than 7500 A if we want to catch it with optical telescopes.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 A. The observed wavelength is λ = 1216 * (1 + z). We want λ <= 7500 A.

So solving for z: 1216 (1 + z) <= 7500.

Divide both sides by 1216: (1 + z) <= 7500 / 1216.

Let me calculate that. 7500 ÷ 1216 ≈ let's see, 1216 * 6 is 7296, which is near 7500. 7500-7296 is 204. So 6 + 204/1216 ≈6.167. So 1 + z <= approx 6.167 → z <=5.167. Wait
