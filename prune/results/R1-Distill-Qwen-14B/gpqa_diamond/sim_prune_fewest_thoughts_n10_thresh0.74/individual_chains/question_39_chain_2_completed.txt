Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, we've got 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, the wave function usually has to satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable, which means the integral of the absolute square must be 1. Oh right, because probabilities must add up to 1.

But wait, the problem states that when they measured the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That probably means the wave function is zero outside of this interval. Oh wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that doesn't immediately look like a zero outside x=1 and x=3. Unless the wave function is only defined (non-zero) between 1 and 3.

Wait, maybe the wave function is given as that expression for the region where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the given expression is valid only from x=1 to x=3. So, the wave function is non-zero only in that interval.

But wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd because I'm more familiar with real wave functions, but I think complex wave functions are okay. Oh wait, but when you square the absolute value, the imaginary part factors in. So the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

Wait, but the wave function here is a function of x, but it's written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, the real part is a / sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, that can't be right because the imaginary part is a constant, which for a wave function is unusual. Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is in the form (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{-i something}, but in the question, it's written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps the wave function is a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. That would make the wave function ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i. Wait, but that would make the function have a constant imaginary part, which might not be the usual case. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is a real function, but the problem statement has a typo. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, but for a free particle, it's usually a real function. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is in a specific form where the imaginary part is 0.5, but that's not common. Or maybe it's written as a sum of real and imaginary parts, but I'm not sure.

Let me think again. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function with a real part a/(sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary part of -0.5.

Wait, but in reality, the wave function for a particle in a box or an infinite potential well is usually real or has a specific form. But perhaps in this case, the wave function is given in that form only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, in the problem statement, it's said that the wave function is valid in the part of space where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside that, it's zero.

But the wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i only between x=1 and x=3. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because the absolute square of a complex number a + ib is (a)^2 + (b)^2. So in this problem, the probability density is [a^2/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, but integrating the probability density from x=1 to x=3 should give 1, because the total probability is 1.

So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let me write that out:

Integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Hmm, okay. So I can compute that integral and solve for a.

Let me compute the integral term by term.

First term: Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x)] dx.

Let me make a substitution: Let u = 1 + x. Then du = dx. When x=1, u=2; x=3, u=4.

So the integral becomes a² * ∫ from 2 to 4 of (1/u) du = a² * (ln u) evaluated from 2 to 4. So that's a² (ln 4 - ln 2) = a² ln(2) because ln(4/2) = ln 2.

Second term: Integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx. 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln 2 + 0.5 = 1.

So solving for a²:

a² ln 2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

a² = 0.5 / ln 2

Compute ln 2: approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7209.

Then a is the square root of that.

sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close. So the value of a is approximately 0.85.

Wait, but let me check my steps again.

1. The wave function is given as a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. So the absolute square is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. That would be a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

2. The integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx equals 1.

3. Split into two integrals: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

4. The first integral becomes a² * ln(4/2) = a² ln 2.

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1)=0.5.

So equation: a² ln 2 + 0.5 =1 → a² = 0.5 / ln 2.

Compute 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7209.

sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the wave function expression. Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But if the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{-i something}, that would be a standard form. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) times e^{-i (something)}, but in this problem, it's written as a real and imaginary part, which is a bit unusual. But regardless, the absolute square is [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2, as I did earlier.

So perhaps the question is correctly set, and our calculation is correct. Therefore, a is approximately 0.85, so option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), as particles are not found outside this interval. The probability density is given by the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The total probability must equal 1, so we integrate \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)

   Using the substitution \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \), the limits change from \( x=1 \) (\( u=2 \)) to \( x=3 \) (\( u=4 \)). The integral becomes:

   \[
   a^2 \int_2^4 \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_2^4 = a^2 (\ln 4 - \ln 2) = a^2 \ln 2
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining the two terms, the total integral becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln 2 + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln 2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln 2}
\]

Using \( \ln 2 \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7209
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7209} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to \( a \approx 0.849 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
