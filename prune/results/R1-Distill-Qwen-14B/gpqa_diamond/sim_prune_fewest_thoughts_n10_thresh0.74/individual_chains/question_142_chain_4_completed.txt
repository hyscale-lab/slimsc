Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including both pure states and mixed states. Wait, what's the difference between pure and mixed states again? Oh right, a pure state has a density matrix that is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, while a mixed state is a statistical mixture of projectors.

Looking at ρ, it's a sum of |0><0| and |1><1|, each multiplied by 1/2. So this looks like a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. That means it's a mixed state. 

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. I think qubit space is represented as a Bloch sphere, right? The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

But how does the density matrix translate to a point in the Bloch sphere? Oh wait, every density matrix can be represented as a point on or inside the Bloch sphere. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (like (x,y,z)) that defines the point. 

So for ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, let's compute it. Let's expand this. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ becomes (I)/2.

Wait, but I thought that the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is I/2, then (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That would imply that r·σ is zero. Let's see: (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 + (r·σ)/2. So setting this equal to I/2, (r·σ)/2 must be zero. That means r·σ = 0.

Which vector r would satisfy this? The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. 

If r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero, then r·σ is zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0). That means the point is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which is the completely mixed state. Because in the Bloch sphere, the origin is the maximally mixed state, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. 

So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the correct position. 

Wait, let me double-check. The Bloch vector r is (x,y,z), and for the density matrix ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. If ρ is (I)/2, then r must be zero. So yes, the point is at the origin. So the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is a statistical mixture of the states \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \), each with equal probability. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we note that single-qubit density matrices can be represented in the form 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector defining the point in the Bloch sphere, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Expanding the given density matrix, \( |0\rangle \langle 0| = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( |1\rangle \langle 1| = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Adding these gives the identity matrix, so 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this to the general form \( \rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} \), it is evident that \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). This implies \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere. The origin represents the maximally mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
