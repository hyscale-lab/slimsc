Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with some numbers in meters.

Wait, mean decay distance. Oh right, when a particle is moving, it can't travel far before decaying. The mean decay distance is kind of like the average distance it travels before breaking apart. I think this has to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh, right, the formula must involve the lifetime, the particle's speed, and maybe some relativistic effects.

So, the mean decay distance (L) is given by L = gamma * v * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and tau is the proper lifetime. But wait, how do I find tau here?

I remember that the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula is Γ = ħ / tau. Oh wait, no, wait. No, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the width (Γ) to the lifetime (tau) as Γ ≈ ħ / tau. So, tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should double-check the formula. Oh right, Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime (tau) is tau = ħ/(Γ). But units might be tricky here.

So, let me jot down the steps. First, compute the lifetime tau using the width Γ. Then, find the velocity v of the meson. Then, compute gamma, the Lorentz factor, using the energy E. Then, compute L = gamma * v * tau.

Wait, but wait. The energy given is the production energy, E_X = 8 GeV. But the mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So, the total energy is higher than the rest mass. So the meson is moving relativistically. So,
