Okay, so I have this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, right? Something about the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Let me think. Oh yeah, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ℏ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants involved. 

The question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. Oh, right, angular size is the apparent size of an object as seen from a certain distance. So the formula for angular size is θ ≈ diameter of the object / distance. But wait, since θ is in degrees and the distance is in parsecs, maybe I need to convert that angle to radians to make the calculations easier. Or perhaps there's a way to relate the angular size directly to the radius.

Wait, θ is 1e-17 degrees. That's a very small angle, which makes sense because the black hole is supermassive and at a huge distance. I should convert that angle to radians because the formulas usually use radians. Oh, right, to convert degrees to radians, I multiply by π/180. So θ in radians would be 1e-17 * π/180. Let me write that down: θ ≈ (1e-17) * (π/180) radians.

The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. I need to convert that into meters because the entropy formula uses SI
