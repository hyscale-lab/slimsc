Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. The goal is to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with a volume and a pH.

First, I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The formula is Fe(OH)3, so the molar mass would be the sum of the atomic weights of Fe, O, and H. Let me calculate that.

Fe has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH group has (16 + 1) = 17 g/mol, and there are three of them. So 3 * 17 = 51 g/mol. Adding the Fe gives 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol approximately. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, no, because Fe(OH)3 is Fe plus 3 OH groups, each OH is 17 g/mol. So 55.85 + (3 * 17) = 55.85 + 51 =106.85 g/mol. So the molar mass is approximately 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. To find moles, it's mass divided by molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me calculate that more accurately. Let me compute 0.1 / 106.85. Hmm, 106.85 * 0.000936 is roughly 0.1? Let me check: 106.85 * 0.000936 = 106.85 * 9.36e-4 = (approx) 106.85 * 0.0009 is about 0.096, and 0.000036 *106.85 is about 0.0038. So total around 0.0998, which is approximately 0.1. So yeah, 0.000936 mol is about right. Let me note that down as n = 0.000936 mol.

Now, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. It can react with a strong acid. The reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a base, and the acid is monobasic, so each H+ will come from the acid. So the reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Right, so each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve.

So the amount of H+ needed is 3 * n = 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

The acid is monobasic and strong, so it will fully dissociate. The concentration of the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume required is moles divided by concentration. So volume V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait, the options don't have exactly that number. Looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that's the minimum volume for the acid. Hmm, but wait, is that all? Because the total volume of the solution is 100 cm³, which includes the acid volume. So maybe we need to consider that. Wait, but when you mix the acid, which is a certain volume, into the solution, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. Or is the 100 cm³ the total volume after adding the acid? I think the problem says that the total volume is 100 cm³. So when adding the acid, the volume of the acid (V) will be part of the 100
