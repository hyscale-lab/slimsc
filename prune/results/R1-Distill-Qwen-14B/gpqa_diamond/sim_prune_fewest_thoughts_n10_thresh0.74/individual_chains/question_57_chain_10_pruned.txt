Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, okay, I need to think about what I remember from scattering theory and phase shifts.

Let me read the question again. The phase shifts given are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, and they say to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond these. So I guess we only consider these five.

The scattering amplitude... I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by some equation involving the phase shifts. Oh right, the partial wave expansion. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (aₗ + aₗ*) ] sin(lθ + δₗ) or wait, maybe it's (aₗ e^{iδₗ} - aₗ* e^{-iδₗ}) ) / (2i) ) ... Or wait, perhaps I should think about the general expression.

Wait, I think the correct expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( ( (aₗ e^{iδₗ} - aₗ^* e^{-iδₗ}) ) * sin(lθ + δₗ) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe another way: f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ ( (aₗ + aₗ^*) sin(lθ + 2δₗ) ) ]? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (aₗ e^{iδₗ} + aₗ^* e^{-iδₗ}) ) * sin(lθ + δₗ)
