Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about two compounds, A and B, which when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Wait, what's the reaction here? Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and HCl with water... Oh right, that's the nitrous acid conditions. I remember that in such conditions, especially when dealing with alcohols, it's often related to the formation of carbocations or maybe the Beckmann rearrangement? Or wait, another possibility: if the alcohol is adjacent to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, it might undergo some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, think about what happens when an alcohol is treated with nitrous acid. I think when an aliphatic alcohol is treated with nitrous acid under acidic conditions, it can lead to the formation of a nitronium ion, which can protonate the alcohol. But maybe more importantly, I recall that when a secondary alcohol is treated with HCl, NaNO2, and heat, it can form a nitroso intermediate, which can lead to elimination to form a carbonyl group. Oh wait! That's the Stephen reduction or something else? Or maybe it's the formation of a ketone from an alcohol via a diazonium salt?

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is a diol (vicinal diol), then treatment with HCl and NaNO2 could lead to the formation of a carbonyl group through the elimination of water. Because vicinal diols can undergo oxidation or elimination. Oh, right! The oxidation of 1,2-diols (vicinal diols) with strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions typically gives diketones. But wait, in this case, the reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and water. I'm a bit confused about the exact reaction here.

Alternatively, I think that when a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid (HNO2) under acidic conditions, it can form a nitroso compound. For example, in the case of a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the products are
