Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, let's see what I can remember.

The question gives a state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, right? But when you have a superposition like this, especially with a phase phi, the state can become non-Gaussian. Because Gaussian states are easier to handle, and non-Gaussian states are more complex and relevant for things like quantum computing.

The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. And N is the normalization constant, which depends on phi and alpha. The formula for N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). 

The non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, so I need to compute the relative entropy between this state and a Gaussian state. But wait, the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. But coherent states themselves are Gaussian, but their superpositions can be non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is a non-Gaussian state, right?

The relative entropy is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. But wait, when you take the relative entropy between two states, it's usually S(rho||tau) = S(rho) - S(tau) + trace(rho ln tau) - trace(tau ln tau). Wait, no, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in the question, it's given as [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. That would be S(rho) - S(tau). But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct formula for relative entropy in this context. Maybe I should check the formula for non-Gaussianity.

Oh wait, sometimes non-Gaussianity is measured as the difference in the entropy between the state and the most Gaussian state, perhaps? Or maybe here it's using relative entropy as a measure, comparing to a Gaussian state.

But I'm a bit confused about this part. Let's proceed step by step.

The problem gives phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So let's plug these values in.

First, let's compute N. Let's calculate sin(2phi). Since phi is -pi/4, 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) = -1.

Then, exp(-2 alpha^2) with alpha=0.5. alpha squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 1/sqrt
