Okay, so I've got this question here about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, and sometimes that light is absorbed by stuff in front of them, like hydrogen clouds. Oh right, the Lyman alpha line is important here. I think Lyman alpha is a specific wavelength where hydrogen emits or absorbs light, around 1216 Angstroms. Wait, that's in the ultraviolet range, right?

The question is about the redshift. Redshift happens when the wavelength of light is stretched, which happens when the source is moving away. So higher redshift means more stretching. But how does that relate to detecting these clouds with ground-based optical telescopes?

Ground-based telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because our atmosphere absorbs it. So if the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms, which is UV, it might not be detectable from the ground unless it's shifted into the optical range. Oh, right! So the redshift would need to shift that UV wavelength into something visible, which optical telescopes can observe.

So the formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. We need the observed wavelength to be in the optical range. What's the lower end of optical? I think visible light starts around 400 nm, which is 4000 Angstroms. Wait, 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm. Or maybe even longer? Let's see, optical is roughly 400-700 nm, so 400 nm is the lower limit for optical.

So to find the minimum redshift, we set observed wavelength (λ_obs) to 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). Because we want the smallest z where the wavelength is just in the optical range. 

Plugging into the formula: z = (4000) / (1216) - 1. Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 * 3 is 3648, and 4000-3648 is 352. So 3.352/1216 ≈ 0.279. So z is approximately 3.279. So about 3.28.

Wait, but the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. Hmm. So the closest option is A)3.

But wait, maybe I should double-check. Because if the cloud's own redshift is z, then the Lyman alpha line would be at 1216*(z+1) Angstroms. We need that to be less than or equal to the cutoff for optical, which is about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms) or maybe higher? Wait, no, because if the wavelength is longer, it's in the infrared, which ground-based optical might not pick up. Wait, no, optical goes up to
