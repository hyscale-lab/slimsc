Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which involves the commutator of gamma matrices. Oh right, gamma matrices are part of the Dirac equation, so ψ is a Dirac spinor, which has a mass dimension of 3/2. 

Wait, what's the mass dimension of the fields here? Let me recall: in four spacetime dimensions, the fields have specific mass dimensions. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2 because the Lagrangian terms must have dimension 4 (since the integral over four dimensions gives action dimensionless). So ψ̄ ψ would be (3/2)+(3/2)=3, and to get L dimension 4, the derivative would add 1. But here, we have σ_{μν} which is made from gamma matrices and their commutators. Oh, and F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which for electromagnetism is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So F has the same dimension as a derivative, which is 1, since A is dimension 1 (because ∂A is dimension 2, and A is in the term like ∂μ Aν, so A has dim 1).

So the term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's figure out each part's mass dimension to find κ's.

Wait, each field's mass dimension: ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is also 3/2. σ_{μν} is made from [γμ, γν], which are dimensionless, so σ is dimensionless. F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each term is ∂ (dim 1) times A (dim 1), so F is dim 2? Wait no, wait: Wait, F is like ∂μ Aν, so each A is dimension 1 (since Maxwell term is like (∂A)^2, so (∂A) is dim 2, so A is dim 1). Then F^{μν} = ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so F has dimension 2 (because ∂ is dim 1, A is dim 1, so ∂A is dim 2). So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Wait, but in the term σ_{μν} ψ, since σ is dimensionless (because it's made from commutators of gammas, which are dim 0), then each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 = 3.

Then the whole term is ψ̄ σ ψ F, which is 3 + 2 =5. But wait, the Lagrangian L must have dimension 4, because when you integrate it over four dimensions, the action is dimensionless. So the Lagrangian itself must be dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian should be dimension 4.

So the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3) + (2) = [κ] +5. That must equal 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]= -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.
