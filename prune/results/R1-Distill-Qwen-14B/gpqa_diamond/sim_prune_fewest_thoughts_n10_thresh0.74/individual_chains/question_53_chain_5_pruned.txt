Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra.

Alright, the first thing I remember is that IR can tell us about functional groups. The problem says the FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Ester groups have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ and an asymmetric stretch around 700-800 cm⁻¹, maybe? Or wait, I think the ester's carbonyl is a strong peak around 1730-1750. Also, the ester oxygen might show up in other regions, but the key is the carbonyl.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. The spectrum has six signals. Let me break down what each part means. Two signals for aromatic-H: so the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of protons. A di-substituted benzene usually has either para or ortho substituents, but wait, in a 6-membered ring, di-substituted can be para, meta, or ortho. For a para substitution, there are two equivalent aromatic protons on each ring, leading to two signals? Or wait, for di-substituted para, the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. So maybe that's what we're seeing here.

Then there are two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and a doublet of quartets indicates coupling with two sets. Or wait, maybe it's a more complex splitting. Let me think: vinyl groups adjacent to substituents can have different coupling patterns. Like in an ester group where the ester is attached to a vinyl group, perhaps.

And two signals for –CH3 groups. Also, there are no signals for –CH2 groups. So the compound must have two different methyl groups, but no methylene groups. That suggests that the structure doesn't have any -CH2- units. So maybe the substituents on the ring are such that any CH2 groups are absent.

Hmm, putting this together. The compound is an ester, which would have the structure R-O-CO-O-R' or wait, no. Ester is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are substituents. So the di-substituted aromatic ring probably has an ester group attached. Since it's a 6-membered ring, maybe a benzene ring with an ester substituent and another group.

Wait, but a di-substituted benzene with an ester group—so the ester is one substituent, what's the other? Let's think about possible substituents. Perhaps the other substituent is a methyl group? Or another ester group? Or maybe a vinyl group?

Wait, but let me think about the NMR signals. So six signals in total. Let's see:

- Two aromatic protons signals: maybe para substitution, each with two equivalent protons. So each substituent is in the para position relative to each other. So for a para di-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite each other. So the aromatic protons would be equivalent in pairs, giving two signals. That makes sense.

Then the vinyl protons: perhaps the substituents are a vinyl group attached to the ester. Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group. Or perhaps it's a substituent that's a vinyl ester.

Wait, another possibility: The substituents are an ester group (like -O-CO-alkyl) and another group, maybe a methyl group. But then the methyl group would have a singlet in the NMR.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So
