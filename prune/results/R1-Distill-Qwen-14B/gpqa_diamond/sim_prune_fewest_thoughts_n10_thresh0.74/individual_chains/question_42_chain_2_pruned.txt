Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's go through it step by step. 

So the question is about three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not too sure about that; maybe it's not super important for this problem. 

The main data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and their masses. The question is asking about the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. Hmm.

First, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like Te = T_star * ( ( Luminosity of star ) / (16 * pi * sigma * R_star^2 * (1 - albedo) * (distance)^2 )) )^(1/4). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, the formula for equilibrium temperature is Te = T_eff * ( (1 - albedo) / (4 * epsilon) )^(1/4) * ( L / (16 * pi * sigma * R^2) )^(1/4) ?

Wait, perhaps a simpler version. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because the formula for equilibrium temperature is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 distance)} ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) / (something...). Alternatively, I can think of it as Te proportional to sqrt(R_star/(distance)) multiplied by (1 - albedo)^(1/4) and other constants.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the formula as Te = ( ( L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * pi * sigma * d^2) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, d is the orbital distance, and sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Right, that sounds more accurate. Because the star's flux is L/(4 pi d^2), and the planet absorbs (1-a) of that, over an area pi R^2 (cross-section), and emits from the entire surface area 4 pi R^2
