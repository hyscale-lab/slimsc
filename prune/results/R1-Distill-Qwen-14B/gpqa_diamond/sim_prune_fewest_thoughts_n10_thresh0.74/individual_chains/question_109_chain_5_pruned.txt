Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a bound system of two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The problem mentions Pauli statistics and some conditions involving isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers. The formula given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Hmm, I remember Pauli's exclusion principle has something to do with antisymmetry of wave functions, but I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the formula here.

The final state of the NN system has T(NN) = 0. So, I need to find which partial wave is not permitted based on the conservation of angular momentum and parity. The options are A to D, each with different angular momentum states for the emitted particle X.

First, let me parse the given information. The initial state is a 1S0 state. Wait, how is that expressed in the term symbol notation? The term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 means 2*0 +1 =1, so the term is ^1S_0. So S is 0, L is 0 (since S is the orbital angular momentum, and the term is 1S0; wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So for 1S0, S is the total spin. S=0, L is the orbital angular momentum. So in the initial state, the orbital angular momentum (L) is 0 because it's S, which is spherically symmetric. Wait, no—wait, the notation is a bit tricky. The term symbol is given as 1S0. So S here is the total orbital angular momentum, and 0 is the total angular momentum J. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Wait, no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 would mean S is the spin? Or L is the orbital angular momentum? Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The term symbol is (2S+1)L J, where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum (like l), and J is the total angular momentum. Wait, no, I think S and L are the quantum numbers, not necessarily the actual angular momenta. So, for the state 1S0, the (2S+1) equals 1 → S=0. Then L is the orbital angular momentum, which is denoted by the letter S. So S here corresponds to L=0 (since S in term symbol refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number, not the spin). Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused because S is used for both spin and orbital angular momentum in different contexts.

Wait, I think I should clarify this. In the term symbol, the letters S, P, D, F, etc., correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum number L. So S stands for L=0, P for L=1, D for L=2, etc. So the initial state is 1S0. Breaking that down: the first part is 1, which is (2S+1), so S is 0. Then the letter S, which is L=0. And J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

So the initial state is two nucleons in a state with S=0 (so their spins are paired, anti-aligned), L=0 (so they're in an s-wave), and J=0 (so total angular momentum is zero).

They emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is negative. I remember that the parity of a particle depends on its orbital angular momentum. Specifically, parity is (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle.

Wait, but how does that tie into the problem? Well, the problem involves conservation of parity, which is a multiplicative quantum number. So the initial parity of the system must equal the product of the parity of the final states.

Wait, but the initial state is the NN system in a 1S0 state. The parity of that state is (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system. Since L=0 for 1S0, the parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

When the NN system emits X, the total parity must be conserved. So the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of particle X must equal the initial parity of the system, which is +1.

So P_initial = P_final_total.

P_final_total = P(NN_final) * P(X).

So (P(NN_final) ) * (P(X) ) = P_initial = +1.

We know that X has parity P(X) = -1. So,

P(NN_final) * (-1) = +1 → P(NN_final) = -1.

So the parity of the final NN state must be -1.

Now, the parity of the NN state is determined by their angular momentum. The parity is (-1)^L_final, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the final state.

So (-1)^L_final = -1 → L_final must be odd. Because (-1) raised to an odd number is -1.

So L_final must be odd. So the final NN state must have orbital angular momentum L being 1, 3, etc.

Wait, but looking at the options, each option gives the final state of the NN
