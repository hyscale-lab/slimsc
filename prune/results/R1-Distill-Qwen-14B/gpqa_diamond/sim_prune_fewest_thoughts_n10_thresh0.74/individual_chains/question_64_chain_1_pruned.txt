Alright, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack everything.

So, the problem says there's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They heated this mixture to 200°C without air. When they did that, only a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were passed through three different tubes: first through anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then through a Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally through red-hot copper. The results are that tubes 1 and 3 gained 3.60g and 0.80g, respectively. Tube 2 didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Okay, let me break this down. First, the setup. When salts A and B are heated, they decompose to form gases. The gases are passed through these tubes, each of which reacts with certain gases.

Let's think about each tube:

1. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is anhydrous. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to dry gases because it can absorb water vapor. So, any water vapor in the gas mixture would be absorbed here, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of water. So, the 3.60g increase is likely due to the absorption of H2O.

2. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas mixture had CO2, it would react with the solution (like in a carbonation reaction). But the weight of tube 2 didn't change, meaning no CO2 was present. So, the gas that would have reacted must not have been there.

3. Tube 3 uses red-hot copper. I think this is for the reduction of NOx. For example, NO2 might be reduced to something else. Wait, when NO2 is passed over hot copper, it reacts to form Cu(NO3)2, water, and releases NO. Or wait, I'm a bit rusty. Let me think again. The reaction is probably something like:

4 Cu + 8 NO2 → 4 Cu(NO3)2 + 2 N2O + something? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another possibility is that NO2 is reduced to NO or N2. Alternatively, when NO2 is passed through a copper tube, it might react as follows: 4 NO2 + 2 Cu → 2 Cu(NO3)2 + N2. Or perhaps it's 4 NO2 + 2 Cu → 2 Cu(NO3)2 + N2↑. Wait, but in any case, the gas that comes out after tube 3 would be something else, maybe N2. But the problem states that gas C is collected, and its volume is 2.24 L at STP. So, 2.24 L is 2.24 / 22.4 = 0.1 moles of gas C. Since 1 mole is 22.4 L at STP, 2.24 L is 0.1 mol.

Wait, but tube 3 increased by 0.80g. What's in tube 3? It's a red-hot copper. So, the reaction is probably with NO2. Let me think about what's happening. Red-hot copper, which is in a +2 oxidation state, reacts with NO2. The reaction is: 

4 Cu + 8 NO2 → 4 Cu(NO3)2 + 2 N2O (maybe?) or perhaps another product.

Alternatively, another reaction: 4 Cu + 6 NO2 → 4 Cu(NO3)2 + 2 NO.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: NO2 reacts with copper when it's hot. The balanced equation
