Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because enthalpy of formation problems can get tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks like a pretty complex molecule. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

Wait, but the problem gives me some bond energies. Oh right, when you calculate enthalpy of formation using bond energies, you usually consider the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products.

Wait, no, the method I remember is using the enthalpy of atomization. Oh right! The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

Wait, no, wait. Maybe it's the other way around. Because when bonds break, you're putting energy in (endothermic), and when bonds form, you release energy (exothermic). So the formula should be: 

Enthalpy of reaction = [sum of bond energies broken] - [sum of bond energies formed]

Wait, no, that's for the reaction itself. But for enthalpy of formation, how does that tie in?

Alternatively, I think the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the sum of the bond energies required to break all bonds in the reactants (the elements) and subtract the bond energies in the target molecule.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The general approach is that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by taking the enthalpy required to break all bonds in the reactants (in their standard forms) and subtract the enthalpy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

But wait, the formula I remember is:

ΔHf° = Σ (ΔH of bonds broken in reactants) - Σ (ΔH of bonds formed in products)

But wait, no. Because the standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

So the process is: elements (like H2, C) → compound.

So to calculate this, I think we can model it as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the product (the compound).

But wait, the product is the molecule given, and the reactants are the elements in their standard states. So for each element, we have to calculate the bond energies.

Wait, let's see. For example, carbon is in the form of graphite or diamond, but the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in one mole of the element to produce gaseous atoms.

So for each element, the enthalpy of atomization is given. The problem states the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. So for each C atom in the molecule, it contributes 10
