Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details.

Alright, so the star in question has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is probably the Saha equation, which relates the ionization states of atoms to temperature and density. But wait, the problem is about two energy levels of neutral Ti, so maybe it's more about the Boltzmann equation than the Saha equation. Because Saha deals with ionization, Boltzmann deals with populations of different energy levels within the same ionization state.

Right, so the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels (n1 and n2) is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the Teff is lower. Let me think about the ratio. The ratio is n1/n2, right? Or wait, the ratio is n2/n1? Or is it the other way around? Oh, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio (maybe n1/n2) is lower. So the question is, when the star is without spots (Teff=6000 K), what's the ratio compared to when it's with spots (5500 K).

Wait, no, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. That implies that when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So the ratio
