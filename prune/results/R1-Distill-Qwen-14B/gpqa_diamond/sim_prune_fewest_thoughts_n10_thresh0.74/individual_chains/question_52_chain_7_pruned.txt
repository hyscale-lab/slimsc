Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can work through it. Alright, let's read the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we can assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds in the photosphere.

Hmm. So, I remember that in LTE, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. But wait—wait, how do the spots affect the overall temperature? The spots are cooler regions, so when a significant part of the star's surface is covered by them, the star's total luminosity decreases. But the photospheric temperature here refers to the effective temperature, which is the average. So the effective temperature is lower when the spots are present.

But wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the Teff decreases to 5500 K. So, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. But how does that affect the energy level population ratio?

The transition in question is between two energy levels of Ti. The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 (n2/n1) depends exponentially on the temperature. So, if the temperature changes, this ratio will change accordingly.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. That suggests that when the star is cooler, the ratio is lower. So, when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio is higher.

So, the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. Let's think about how the ratio depends on temperature. The formula for the ratio is (n2/n1) proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. Wait, wait, the energy difference E2-E1 is positive if E2 is higher. So the exponent is negative when E2 > E1. So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so
