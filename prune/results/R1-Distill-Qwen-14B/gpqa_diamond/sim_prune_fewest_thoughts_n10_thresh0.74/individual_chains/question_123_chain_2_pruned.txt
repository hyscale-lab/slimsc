Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly toward the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking, how far does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?

Wait, so in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. Since the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta must be moving at the same speed, right? Because in inertial frames, if one object is moving at v towards another, the other is moving at -v in the first's frame. So the speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.

Now, the tricky part is the time. The time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. But we need to find how much time passes in the galaxy's frame, or wait, no—wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So we need to account for time dilation due to relativity because the frames are moving relative to each other.

Hmm, right. Special relativity comes into play here. Since the frames are moving at 60,000 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light, time dilation will affect the measurements.

Wait, let me get this straight. The ejecta's frame (let's call it S') measures the galaxy's center moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. The galaxy's frame (S) sees the ejecta moving towards it at the same speed, but in the opposite direction.

We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame (S) during the time t in S', which is 50 seconds. So first, I think we need to find the time that passes in the galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Time dilation formula: t = gamma * (t' + (v x)/c²), but wait, that's the formula for the time in the stationary frame (S) when an event happens at x in S'. Wait, no—actually, the time dilation formula is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² ), but in this case, maybe we can think about the proper time?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the Lorentz transformations. The time measured in the galaxy's frame (t) for an event that occurs at t' = 50 s in the ejecta's frame.

Assuming the event is the passage of time. So in the ejecta's frame, the time elapsed is t' =50 s. Where is the event happening? Well, in the ejecta's frame, the event is the
