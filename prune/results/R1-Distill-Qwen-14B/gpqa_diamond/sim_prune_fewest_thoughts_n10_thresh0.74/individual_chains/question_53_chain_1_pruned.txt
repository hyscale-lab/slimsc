Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound. It's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so that's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring. The molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2. The options are labeled A to D.

The question gives some spectral data. The FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm^-1, and an O-H stretch for the alcohol part, but wait, wait. Wait, no. Esters don't have an O-H stretch because they don't have a hydroxyl group. Oh wait, no, wait. Esters are formed from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. So, the ester functional group is R-O-CO-R'. So, in IR, esters show a strong peak around 1740 for the C=O, and another around 1250-1050 for the ester C-O stretch. So the FTIR here confirms that there's an ester group present.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. Let's parse the information given. There are six signals:

1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Wait, aromatic protons usually split into multiple signals depending on their substituents. Since the ring is di-substituted, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. For a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern could be para, meta, or ortho. But the question says it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is benzene, so di-substituted.

If the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would split into two sets: the two protons next to each substituent (if substituents are strong deactivating, but maybe it's something else). Wait, but maybe in a di-substituted benzene, the substituents cause the aromatic protons to split into two groups. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that there are
