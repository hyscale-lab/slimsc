Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. It's represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay which satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). So we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So first, I'll compute Ay. Since c is h/(4π), Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

But wait, when I'm looking for eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I should probably consider the matrix Ay itself. Let me write it out.

Ay is (h/(4π)) * S, so:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So if I compute the matrix elements, each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π). Hmm. But maybe I can factor that out when finding eigenvalues, because when I set up the characteristic equation, the scalar will just multiply the entire matrix, and eigenvalues will be scaled by that.

Wait, so for a matrix M, if I multiply by a scalar k, the eigenvalues of k*M are k times the eigenvalues of M. So maybe I can first find the eigenvalues of S, then multiply them by h/(4π) to get the eigenvalues of Ay.

That sounds efficient. So let me find the eigenvalues of S first.

The eigenvalues λ of a matrix satisfy det(S - λI) = 0.

So S is:

[ 0    -i ]
[ i     0 ]

So the matrix S - λ I is:

[ -λ    -i ]
[  i    -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

Wait, let's compute (-i)(i): that
