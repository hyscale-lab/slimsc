Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are often represented as vectors of their components, like P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh right, because each component of P is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the first step is probably to find the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis. So the direction vector n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis. So the direction vector would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) but wait, no, that's for a general direction. But since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π/2 or something, but perhaps in this case, since it's arbitrary in x-z, maybe φ isn't fixed. But wait, the problem says 'along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane'. Hmm, perhaps the angle is θ from the z-axis, so the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the direction vector n is a unit vector. So it can be written as n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle. But since n is in the x-z plane, that means φ is 0 or π, because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So φ must be 0 or π, which would make the direction vector either (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ), depending on φ. But the problem says it's an arbitrary direction, so perhaps for generality,
