Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water is a common test for unsaturation. So, the two liquids in mixture X probably have double bonds or triple bonds because they react with Br2, causing it to decolorize.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction that forms mixture Y, which is also equimolar but made up of two different liquids. Importantly, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, mixture Y might have fully saturated bonds—like single bonds—so no double or triple bonds left. That makes sense because if Y doesn't react with bromine, it's probably saturated.

The next part says that hydrogenating both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, hydrocarbon Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, which is roughly 1/7. Oh, wait, that calculation—mass percent H is (mass of H)/(molar mass) * 100. So if Z is CnH2m, then we can find the ratio.

Let me compute that. Let's say Z is CnH2m. The molar mass is (12n + 2m). The mass of H is 2m g/mol. So, (2m)/(12n + 2m) ) * 100 = 14.28%. Let me express this as an equation:

(2m) / (12n + 2m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator: 2m = 0.1428*(12n + 2m)

Let me compute 0.1428 times the denominator.

0.1428 is approximately 1/7. So 1/7*(12n + 2m) = 2m.

Multiply both sides by 7: 12n + 2m = 14m

So 12n = 12m → n = m. So the formula is CnH2n. That must be an alkene or something else, but wait, when X is hydrogenated, it produces Z, which doesn't react further. So Z must be fully saturated. If X had double bonds, hydrogenating would add H2 across them.

Wait, but Z is CnH2n. Wait, that's the formula for an alkene. Oh wait, no, because for alkanes, it's CnH2n+2. So wait, if Z is CnH2n, that would be an alkene, but it doesn't react further with hydrogen. So perhaps Z is a cyclic compound, like cyclopropane or something else where adding more H2 isn't possible? Or maybe it's a single bond but with some structure that doesn't allow more hydrogenation.

Wait, but the problem says that after hydrogenation, only Z is formed, and Z doesn't react further. So Z must be an alkane, but then formula would be CnH2n+2. Wait, but according to earlier calculation, Z is CnH2n, which isn't possible for an alkane. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recheck the calculation. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is about 1/7. So:

Hydrogen mass fraction = (mass H) / (molar mass) *100 = 14.28

Let me write the equation again. Let the formula of Z be CnHm.

Mass of H = m g per mole. Molar mass = 12n + m.

So (m)/(12n + m) * 100 = 14.28 → m/(12n + m) = 0.1428 ≈ 1
