Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out which mutant is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has this anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for making this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then sequenced the target gene in all the mutants. The changes are in the beginning of the first exon.

Our goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound. That probably means we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Common ways this can happen include creating a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), causing a frameshift which changes the entire downstream amino acid sequence, or altering the reading frame enough that the protein doesn't function.

Looking at the options:

The intact gene is given as:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the start codon is at the very beginning (ATG), and it runs through the sequence until the stop codon TGA.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at this, let's compare to the original. Original first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... Let's look at the changes:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT
Mutant 1: TCT ACG CTT GGT ACT?

Wait, maybe I should look for the exact differences. Let me write down the original and mutant 1.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA TAA ...
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA TAA ...

Wait, actually, let me count the letters. The first part after ATG is the same until a certain point.

Wait, perhaps I can compare the sequences line by line.

Intact gene segment: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

So the first few nucleotides after ATG are TTT in wild type, and TCT in mutant1. Then in wild type, it's CTC GCT, which is CTC followed by GCT. In mutant1, it's ACG CTT. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to look for indels (insertions or deletions) or substitutions.

Wait, in the given sequences, each line is 70 or so nucleotides. Let me think about where the mutations are.

Looking at the start:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...
Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

So the
