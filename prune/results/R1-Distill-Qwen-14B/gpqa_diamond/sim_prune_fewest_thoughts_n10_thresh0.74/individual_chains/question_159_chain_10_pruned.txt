Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. Hmm. I'm not super familiar with quasars, but I remember they are very bright and emit across the electromagnetic spectrum.

The question is about determining the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. The setup gives the parameters of the universe as per the Lambda-CDM model: Hubble constant H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m is 0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda is 0.7, and the universe is flat. So, flat universe means that Omega_m + Omega_lambda = 1, which fits here since 0.3 +0.7=1.

Wait, the question is about the comoving distance for scale factor a=1. Oh, right, comoving distance is a way to measure distance in an expanding universe, and for a=1, that's the current scale factor, so the distance now. So comoving distance is the distance we would measure if we could stop the expansion.

But how do I get this distance from the given observations? The peak at 790 nm and flux dropping below that. Oh, I think this is about redshift. Because if the peak is in the near infrared, which is longer wavelength, that suggests that the quasar's emitted light was redshifted.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. What is the typical rest wavelength of a quasar's emission? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Quasars emit strongly in the UV, I think, because they have very active nuclei. So maybe their rest frame emission peaks in the UV, which is shorter wavelength than optical or infrared. So if we're seeing the peak in the near infrared, that would mean redshift.

For example, let's say the quasar emits in the UV, say at around 120 nm (the Lyman limit for hydrogen), but we observe it at 790 nm. So the redshift z would be (790 / 120) -1. Let me calculate that. 790 / 120 is approximately 6.583. So z=5.583. That's a high redshift, meaning the quasar is very far away.

Wait, but sometimes the peak emission
