Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the setup: an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. Both have Lorentz factors given—electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are both in the upper-right and lower-right directions. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons.

Hmm. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron have equal and opposite charges, their annihilation should conserve both energy and momentum. Oh right, and since photons are massless, their energy is related to their momentum and frequency.

Wait, but the electron and positron are moving in opposite directions. So their momenta would be opposite before collision. Let me think about the initial momenta.

First, the Lorentz factor (γ) is given by γ = total energy (E) / rest mass energy (m0c²). For an electron, the rest mass is about 9.11e-31 kg, but the actual value might not matter here as we can work with variables.

So, the electron's Lorentz factor is 4. Its momentum would be γ * m0 * v, but wait, another formula comes to mind: p = γ m0 v. Alternatively, for relativistic particles, another approach is p = γ m0 c² (1/(c²)) v. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, maybe I should think in terms of relativistic momentum.

Alternatively, I remember that the momentum for a relativistic particle can also be expressed as p = γ m0 v, and since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but another formula for momentum is p = (γ m0 c²) / c^2 * v = γ m0 v. So that's correct.

But perhaps it's easier to calculate the momentum in terms of gamma and rest mass. So, the electron has γ=4, so its momentum is p_e = γ_e m_e c. Wait, wait, no, another approach: since for a particle, p = γ m v. But v can also be expressed in terms of beta, β = v/c. So γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), and v = β c.

So, p = γ m_e β c.

Similarly, for the positron, which is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, it has the same mass, so m_p = m_e. Its Lorentz factor is 2, so γ_p =2.

But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum vector is opposite to that of the electron. Let's say the electron is moving to the right (positive x-direction), so the positron is moving to the left (negative x-direction).

So, the electron's momentum is p_e = γ_e m_e β_e c, but I'm not sure if I can proceed without knowing the velocities. Alternatively, perhaps I can find
