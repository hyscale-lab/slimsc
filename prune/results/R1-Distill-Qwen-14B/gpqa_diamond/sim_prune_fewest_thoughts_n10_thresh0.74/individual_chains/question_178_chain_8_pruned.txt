Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants tells us a lot about the theory, including whether it's renormalizable.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I think I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, first, let me recall how to find the mass dimension of a term in a Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units where ℏ = c = 1. Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless, and it's the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime (which has dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions). So each term's dimension must be 4.

Let's break down the dimensions of each part in L_int. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

First, what's the dimension of ψ? Fermions like ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is (i∂ - m)ψ = 0, so m has dimension 1, and ∂ has dimension 1, so ψ must have dimension 3/2 to make the equation work.

So ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. But the gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices, right? So the structure σ_{μν} is dimensionless as well. So σ doesn't contribute to the mass dimension.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field strength tensor F is defined as ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so A is a vector potential, which has dimension 1 (since the field tensor has to have dimension 2, as [∂] is 1, so each derivative acting on A gives dimension 1, hence A has dimension 1). So F has dimension 2.

Putting it all together: the term ψ̄ σ ψ F.

So each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then F is 2, so the product is 3 + 2 = 5. So the entire term L_int must have dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian.

Wait, but wait: L_int is part of the Lagrangian, so each term in L must have dimension 4. So the product κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F) must be dimension 4.

So:

[κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4.

We have [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ] + [F] → [ψ̄] is 3/2, same for ψ, σ is 0, F is 2. So 3/2 +3/2 +0 +2 = 3 +2 =5.

So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, regarding renormalizability. The theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because in four dimensions, a renormalizable interaction has coupling dimension ≤ 4. Wait, no, to clarify: for a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimension because they
