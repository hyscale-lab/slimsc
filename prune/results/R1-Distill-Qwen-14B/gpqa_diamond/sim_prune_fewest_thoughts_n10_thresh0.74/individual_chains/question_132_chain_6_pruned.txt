Okay, so I'm looking at this NMR problem, and I need to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that the solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

First, I'll think about the molecular formula. C10H14. For aromatic compounds, the degree of unsaturation can be calculated. The formula is C10H14: 2n +2 = 14 → n=6. So 10 carbons minus 6 from the formula gives 4 degrees of unsaturation. So possible structures are likely aromatic rings with substituents, maybe with some branching.

Wait, because benzene has 3 degrees (one ring plus three double bonds), so each benzene would account for 4 (the ring is 3, but wait, let's calculate properly. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 → (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four DoU: one ring (3) and one double bond, or two rings, but more likely a benzene ring (3) and another double bond, but wait, maybe all are substituents on a benzene ring. Alternatively, maybe two rings (like naphthalene, but naphthalene has formula C10H8, which is not matching). So perhaps each compound is a mono-substituted benzene with several methyl groups.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So substituents would add C4H8. Each substituent is probably a methyl group (-CH3), since two substituents would add 2*CH3 → C2H6, but wait, 6 (benzene) + 4 substituent carbons → that's not possible. Oh wait, maybe the substituents are more than just methyl.

Wait, maybe each substituent is an ethyl group. Let's see: For each ethyl group, it's -CH2CH3. So for two ethyl groups, that's 4 carbons and 6 hydrogens (since each ethyl is 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens? Wait, no: each ethyl is -CH2CH3, so each has 2 carbons, 7 hydrogens? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: each ethyl group is two carbons. So if I have two ethyl substituents on a benzene, the formula would be C6H6 - 2*H (since each substitution replaces a H) + 2*(C2H5). So that's C6 + 4 = C10? No, benzene is C6, each ethyl adds 2 C, so 6 + 2*2 = 10, yes. Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H. Two ethyl groups add 2*(5) =10 H? Wait, benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl substituent adds 5 H (because the ethyl group is -CH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H? So two substituents would add 10 H, but since each substitution replaces one H, total H is 6 - 2 +10 =14. Which matches the formula C10H14. So two ethyl groups on benzene would give C8H10, wait no. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Two ethyl substituents would give C6 + 2*(2) = C10. H: each ethyl is -CH2CH3, which has 7 H? Or
