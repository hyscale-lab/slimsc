Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B) 3, C) 5, D) 0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated by the formula Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbon atoms, H is hydrogen, X is halogens, and N is nitrogen. But wait, in this problem, I don't think there are any halogens or nitrogens involved. So the formula simplifies to (2C +2 - H)/2.

But first, I need to figure out what the product is when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think red phosphorus is used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) reaction to facilitate the elimination of certain groups. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus is often used in the deoxygenative cleavage of carbonyl groups. For example, in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) are reduced to methylene groups. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the reaction of a carbonyl with red phosphorus and HI usually leads to the formation of
