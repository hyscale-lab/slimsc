Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that stars can have spots, like sunspots but on other stars, which are cooler regions. These spots can affect the overall temperature of the star's photosphere.

The star in question has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the spots are making the star appear cooler overall.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”so ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots, I think.

Wait, the ratio is level 1 to level 2. Oh, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is proportional to exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where E2 is higher than E1, so the exponential is negative.

The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Here, g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy) of each level.

Wait, but in this problem, we're looking at the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So, what's changing? The effective temperature of the photosphere, I think.

Wait, no. Wait, when the star has spots, parts of the surface are cooler. But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the effective
