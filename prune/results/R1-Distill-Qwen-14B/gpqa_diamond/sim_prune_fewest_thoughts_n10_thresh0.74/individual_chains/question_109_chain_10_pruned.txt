Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The intrinsic parity of X is -1. Pauli statistics have some conditions here, which probably relate to the quantum numbers of the final state.

Wait, the problem says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh right, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So T must equal S + L +1, but all modulo 2. 

The final NN state has T(NN) =0. So substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which simplifies to S + L = -1 mod 2. But since in mod 2, -1 is 1. So S + L â‰¡1 mod 2. Which means S and L must have opposite parities. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

The problem is to find which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing an initial state (1S0) going to something plus a particle (like p, s, etc.), with certain angular momentum states.

Wait, the term symbol is given as 2S+1 L J. So the initial state is 1S0. So S_initial is 0 (since 2S+1=1 implies S=0), L_initial is 0 (since it's S state), and J_initial is 0. Because the term is 1S0, meaning (2*0+1) S (0), so yes, S=0, L=0, J=0.

When the NN system emits a particle X, the final state will have some other quantum numbers. The system will have new quantum numbers T, S, L, and J. But since Pauli's condition applies, we can figure out the possible states.

The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So when X is emitted, the parity of the system will change. Also, parity conservation must hold, but wait, the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So perhaps the parity of the initial and final states must be considered.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L. So L=0, parity is (-1)^0=1. But when X is emitted, the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X must combine to conserve the overall parity.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The parity of the initial system is P_initial. The parity after emission should be P_final * P_X = P_initial, because parity is conserved in strong interactions, I think. But wait, in weak interactions, parity isn't conserved, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume parity is conserved.

Wait, the particle X is emitted, so the NN system must combine with X. But the problem is only considering the NN state after emission. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.
