Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. I remember that when a spin is in a magnetic field, its energy levels are quantized based on the spin orientation. When the field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which can cause transitions between states and oscillations in expectation values.

Wait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let me think: the spin is spin-1/2, so the possible S_z values are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, but wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma * S_z. Oh, right, mu = gamma S_z, which aligns with the field.

So when the field is along +Z, the magnetic moment is aligned, so the particle is in the eigenstate |+z> or |-z>? Since it's aligned, I think it's in the |+z> state. But wait, the problem says the field is turned off and another along +Y is turned on. So the initial state is after the field is along Z, but before the switch, the state is an eigenstate of S_z.

Wait, when the magnetic field is first applied along Z, the energy levels are determined by the Hamiltonian H = -mu·B. So, in the Z direction, H = -mu B_z. Since mu is gamma S_z, that's H = -gamma B S_z. The eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies E+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E- = gamma B (ħ/2), but wait, wait, wait. Let me get the signs right. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is U = - mu · B. So, U = - gamma B S_z. But S_z has eigenvalues (ħ/2) and (-
