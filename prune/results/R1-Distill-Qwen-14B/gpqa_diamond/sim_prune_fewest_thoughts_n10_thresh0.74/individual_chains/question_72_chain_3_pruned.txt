Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll do my best.

So the question is about a series of reactions starting with a specific compound and going through several steps. The goal is to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product, product 4.

Let me break down the problem into each reaction step and figure out what each step does.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. So, I imagine the norbornene (because it's diene) with an oxygen substituent.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Hmm, I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. The diene is the norbornadiene derivative, and the dienophile is the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexadiene. Sodium iodide is often a catalyst or helps in elimination reactions, but in Diels-Alder, maybe it's just a base?

Wait, but the dienophile has two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons. So when the Diels-Alder happens, each of these groups would add onto the diene. Oh, but wait, the starting dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a cyclohexadiene with two Br groups on adjacent carbons, each as CH2Br2? Or wait, no, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2. So each of the 5 and 6 positions on the cyclohexadiene has a CH2Br2 group.

Wait, no, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl): each of those positions is attached to a CH2Br2 group. So when the Diels-Alder occurs, each CH2Br2 would be part of the adduct.

But wait, Diels-Alder forms a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds. The dienophile would add across the diene. In this case, the dienophile has two substituents, so the product would have two new substituents attached.

Wait, but I'm thinking about the structure after the Diels-Alder. The product would have two new groups from the dienophile attached to the bicyclo structure. Each of those is a CH2Br2 group. So product 1 would have two CH2Br2 groups attached after the Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, but wait, the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the structure is a cyclohexadiene, with the two CH2Br2 groups on carbons 5 and 6. So when Diels-Alder happens, the diene (norbornadiene) would attack the dienophile, and the end
