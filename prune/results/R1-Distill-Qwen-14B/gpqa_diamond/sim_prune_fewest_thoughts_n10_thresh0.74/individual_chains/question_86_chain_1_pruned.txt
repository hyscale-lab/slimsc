Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. Alright, the question is about reactions involving two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, leading to specific products. The products are (R) and (S) forms of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I need to find out which starting materials A and B are used for each reaction.

Hmm, I remember that when you reduce a ketone, you typically get a secondary alcohol. But wait, the product here is a pyranone. Oh right, pyranones are cyclic ketones. So the starting materials must have been something that upon reduction forms this cyclic structure. Wait, maybe they're epoxides? Or perhaps some kind of ester or lactone?

Wait, the reducing agents—LiBH4 and BH3. Oh, wait, BH3 is usually used in the reduction of ketones to alcohols, but wait, no, it's more about the stereochemistry when using certain conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but wait, in which cases does the reducing agent affect the stereochemistry differently? Oh, right! When reducing ketones to alcohols, the stereochemistry depends on the reducing agent used because of the mechanism involved.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is a pyranone, which is a lactone—a cyclic ester. So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, and the reduction breaks it down? No,
