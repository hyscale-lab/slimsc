Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine plants regarding their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

The setup is that they've identified three candidate genes, G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each, and also double mutants. Then they tested these mutants for their resistance to the pathogen. The control has 100% resistance, and the mutants have varying percentages.

The data given is:
- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (so about half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, the question is about how these genes interact. Also, it's given that at least one of them is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are usually upstream regulators.

I remember that in genetics, when you get double mutants, their phenotypes can tell you about the relationships between genes. If a double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, it suggests that the genes are in the same pathway. But in some cases, the double mutant might not be worse than the worse single mutant, which would suggest they're in the same pathway but maybe acting redundantly.

Looking at the data, the single mutants have varying resistances. G2's mutant is completely susceptible (0% resistance), which is the worst. G1's mutant has 75% resistance, so it's less resistant but not as bad as G2. G3 is 50%.

Now the double mutants: g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0%, which is as bad as g2 alone. Wait, but when you have a double mutant that's as bad as one of the single mutants, that might indicate that those genes are in the same pathway. Because if they were in separate pathways, you might expect additive effects. But if they're in the same pathway, then knocking out both might not make the situation worse than just knocking one.

Wait no, actually, if gene B is downstream of gene A, then the single mutant of A would have a certain phenotype, and the single mutant of B would be worse. The double mutant would be the same as the single mutant of B because if A is upstream, and B is downstream, then without A, B can't function either. So the double mutant (A and B) would be same as B mutant.

Similarly, if G2 is the transcription factor, then perhaps G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. Let's think: if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking out G2 would disable both G1 and G3. Because G2 is upstream, so without G2, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed. Wait, but what if G2 is upstream of both? Then the g2 mutant would have neither G1 nor G3 functioning, leading to the worst phenotype, which matches the dataâ€”g2 is 0% resistance.

Wait, but in the data, G2's mutant is 0%, so that suggests that when G2 is not present, the plant can't resist anthracnose. If G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in the g1 mutant, G2 is still present (since only G1 is knocked out), so G2 can activate G3. In the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%, which is better than g2. So without G1, G2 can still activate G3, giving partial resistance. But without G2, both G1 and G3 are inactive, so no resistance.

But wait, what about G3's mutant? G3's resistance is 50%. That suggests that when only G3 is knocked out, the plant can still get
