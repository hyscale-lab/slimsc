Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by breaking down the reaction step by step. I'll take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms.

So, the starting compound is A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, wait, what could that be? Well, C3H6 could be propene or propane, but more likely propene because the next step involves bromination. Oh yeah, propene is an alkene, so maybe it's undergoing addition reaction.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh right, that's a sign of an addition reaction. Alkenes react with bromine (Br2) in CCl4 to add across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane, I think. Or wait, wait, noâ€”propene is CH2=CH2CH3, which would add Br2 to the double bond. So when Br2 adds, it becomes CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Wait, no, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 (which is a dihalogen) would give CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 in CCl4 would result in the bromine adding across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCHBrCH3? Wait, no, no. Adding Br2 to propene gives 1,2-dibromopropane. So the formula is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propene is C3H6. Adding Br2 would add two Br atoms, making it C3H5Br2. So the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3? Wait, let me think again. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is actually CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would cause the double bond to open, adding Br to each carbon. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? So that's
