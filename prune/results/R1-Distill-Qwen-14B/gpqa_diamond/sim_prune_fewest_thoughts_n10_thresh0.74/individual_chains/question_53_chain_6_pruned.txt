Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectra data. Let me break it down.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, the ring is benzene or maybe another aromatic heterocycle, but I think it's benzene since the substituents are probably ester groups or something similar. Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring.

The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, that's a key point telling me that the molecule has at least one ester group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's parse each:

- Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's di-substituted, the ring's protons should be split into different signals. In a para-substituted benzene, there are two equivalent protons, but wait, here it's di-substituted. So, maybe the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are in the ortho positions, the aromatic protons could be split into two doublets or something similar. Alternatively, if it's a meta substitution, but wait, that might give more signals. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the aromatic signals are two in total. Oh wait, but if the substituents are identical, like two ester groups in the para positions, then the ring would have symmetry. Let me think: benzene with two substituents. If the substituents are in the para positions, then the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons. Wait, no, in para substitution, all the aromatic protons are equivalent in pairs. Let me think: for example, if two groups are para, then the ring has two equivalent protons on either side of each substituent. Wait, no, actually, para substitution would lead to two equivalent H's on each remaining carbon. Wait, no, wait, let me imagine the structure. If the substituents are on carbons 1 and 3 (meta), then the aromatic protons would be in two different environments. Alternatively, if substituents are on 1 and 4 (para), then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Wait, maybe in para substitution, the aromatic protons are all equivalent? No, that's not right. Wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, there are two equivalent pairs of protons. For example, each substituent is across from the other, so the ring has two sets of two equivalent protons each. So, in the NMR, that would be two doublets or something similar, each integrating for two protons. So that matches the two aromatic signals.

Next, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or maybe in an ester group. One of these is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps from a trans double bond. Or maybe from an allylic system. Wait, wait, vinyl groups in the substituents. Let me think about the structure. If the substituents on the aromatic ring are ester groups, then each substituent would be something like O-CO-O-R or something else. Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, right? But wait, no, wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if the substituent is an ester, perhaps it's a group like OCOOR. So, perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached via an oxygen, like O-ester.

Wait, no, the substituents are attached directly to the ring. So, for example, if the substituents are ester groups like -OOCR, perhaps. Or maybe the substituents themselves are vinyl groups attached
