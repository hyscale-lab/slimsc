Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when a charge distribution oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated at a specific angle and the form of the function f.

Wait, the setup is that the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis. I think that when such a distribution oscillates, the radiation pattern depends on the angle theta relative to this axis.

The problem says that the maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees. Also, determine the form of the function f which is the power per unit solid angle.

I remember that for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator, which is 90 degrees from the axis, and minimum along the axis. Wait, but wait—the dipole's radiation is maximum perpendicular to the dipole direction. So for a dipole, the radiation pattern is sin^2(theta) or something similar. Oh wait, no, for a dipole, the radiation is proportional to sin^2(theta), meaning maximum at theta=90 degrees. But wait, in this question, the source is an oscillating charge distribution.

Wait, but this is a spheroidal charge distribution, so maybe it's a dipole-like source. Or perhaps it's a quadrupole? Wait, no, I think when the charge distribution oscillates, it's like a dipole oscillation. So the radiation would be dipole radiation.

Dipole radiation has a certain pattern. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle theta. The formula for the power per unit solid angle (dP/dOmega) for dipole radiation is proportional to (1)/(lambda^4) multiplied by sin^2(theta), maybe? Wait, let me think.

The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The Larmor formula for power is ( (e^2 a^2 )/(6πε₀ c³) ) times some angular dependence. The angular part, if I remember right, is (sin²θ), but I'm not entirely sure. Or is it something else?

Wait, in dipole radiation, the electric field in the far zone (radiation zone) is proportional to (1/r) * (e^{i(kr - ωt)}) and varies as sin(theta) in some way. Wait, more accurately, the far-field radiation from a dipole is proportional to (1/r) and the angular part has a sin(theta) dependence. Specifically, the radiation pattern (intensity) is proportional to sin²(theta), right? So the maximum intensity is at theta=90 degrees, where sin(theta)=1.

So the intensity (which is power per unit area per unit solid angle) is maximum at 90 degrees, and zero along the axis (theta=0 and 180 degrees). Wait, but the problem is asking about the power per unit solid angle. The solid angle element is sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So the power per unit solid angle would be like the intensity times the solid angle element, but perhaps more accurately, the power dP in a solid angle dOmega is f(theta) dOmega. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: for a dipole radiator, the radiated power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) is proportional to sin^2(theta) * (frequency)^ something. Let me think about the dependence.

Wait, the Larmor formula for the total power radiated by an accelerating charge is P = (e² a²)/(6πε₀ c³), where a is the acceleration. But when considering the angular dependence, in the far field, the intensity (power per unit area per unit solid angle) is proportional to sin²(theta). So when considering the power per unit solid angle, which is the same as the intensity multiplied by the solid angle element, but actually, the solid angle is dOmega = sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So the total power is the integral over all solid angles of the intensity times dOmega.

Hmm, but in this problem, the function f is the power per unit solid angle, which would be the intensity. So f(theta) = some function involving sin(theta) raised to a power.

Wait, if the maximum is at theta = 90 degrees, then at theta=30 degrees, the intensity would be (sin(30))^2 = (1/2)^2=1/4. But wait, the maximum is at 90 degrees, which is sin(90)=1, so maximum intensity is 1. So the fraction of maximum power at theta=30 degrees would be 1/4. Wait, but wait: the question says the maximum power is A, and the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees is what? So if the function f is f(theta) = (some constant) * sin^2(theta), then the intensity is maximum at theta=90 degrees, so f(theta=90)=A? Or is A the total maximum, so the maximum power is when you integrate over all solid angles. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the question states: "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle. Wait no, no, because the power per unit solid angle would be the intensity, which can't be the maximum power. Maximum power is probably when you sum all solid angles. Wait, no, perhaps the maximum per unit solid angle is A, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the maximum power per unit solid angle is A, and then the question is asking what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30 degrees. Wait, but that would suggest that the power per solid angle can't be more than A. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is the maximum total power, and the question is about the fraction of A that is radiated in the direction theta=30 degrees. But that seems a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again.

"In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and the angle θ. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively, which of the options."

Hmm, okay, so maximum power per unit solid angle is A. So when you have maximum f(theta), that's A. So f(theta) varies with theta, and the maximum is A, which occurs at some theta, say theta0. The question is, at theta=30 degrees, what's the fraction of A that is radiated there.

Wait, but for a dipole, the maximum intensity is at theta=90 degrees. So f(theta=90) = A, and f(theta=30) = (sin(30))^2 * A = (1/2)^2 * A = A/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4. So looking at the options, the possible fractions are 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, or 1/4 again.

Wait, the options for the fraction: Option A is 1/2, B is 1/4, C is 1/4, D is 3/4. So the fraction is 1/4, so options B and C are in play.

Now, for the form of f: the function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. For dipole radiation, the intensity is proportional to (sin(theta))^2. But what about the dependence on lambda?

Wait, the Larmor formula for the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to (omega^2)^2, since a (acceleration) is proportional to omega^2. Alternatively, for an oscillating charge executing simple harmonic motion, a is proportional to omega^2. The intensity is proportional to (e² a²)/(epsilon_0 c^3) * (1/r^2), but when considering the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity, it would be (e^2 a^2)/(something) times (1/r^2) * sin^2(theta). Alternatively, the dependence on wavelength comes in because omega = 2 pi c / lambda, assuming that the speed of light in the medium is c (assuming vacuum). So omega = 2 pi c / lambda, so omega^2 = (4 pi^2 c^2)/(lambda^2).

In the intensity formula, I think the intensity is proportional to (omega^4) * (sin^2(theta)). So substituting omega in terms of lambda, intensity is proportional to (1/lambda^4) * sin^2(theta). So f(theta) is proportional to (1/lambda^4) sin^2(theta). So the function would have a lambda^(-4) dependence.

So looking at the options, which have the fraction 1/4 and f proportional to lambda^-4. So option C is 1/4 and lambda^(-4).

Wait, let's check the options.

Option A: 1/2, lambda^-4.

Option B: 1/4, lambda^-3.

Option C: 1/4, lambda^-4.

Option D: 3/4, lambda^-6.

So the fraction is 1/4 and function form is lambda^-4, so the correct option is C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the dependence on lambda.

The power per unit solid angle (f) is proportional to ( (e^2 a^2) / (something) ) * (1 / lambda^4) * sin^2(theta). Because a is proportional to omega^2, and omega is 2pi c / lambda. So a ~ (omega^2), so a² ~ omega^4, which is (1/lambda^4), because omega = 2pi c / lambda.

So f(theta) = k * (1/lambda^4) * sin^2(theta).

So the function f has a 1/lambda^4 dependence.

So the function's form is lambda^(-4), and the fraction is 1/4.

So the correct option is C.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiation pattern depends on the angle $\theta$ relative to the z-axis, and the power radiated per unit solid angle is given by a function $f(\lambda, \theta)$. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ and the form of $f$.

For a dipole-like oscillating charge distribution, the radiation pattern is proportional to $\sin^2(\theta)$, with the maximum intensity at $\theta = 90^\circ$. At $\theta = 30^\circ$, the intensity is reduced by a factor of $\sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Thus, the fraction of the maximum power $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$.

The function $f(\lambda, \theta)$ represents the power per unit solid angle. For dipole radiation, the intensity is proportional to $\omega^4 \sin^2(\theta)$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency. Since $\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda$, the intensity scales as $\lambda^{-4}$. Therefore, $f(\lambda, \theta)$ has the form $\lambda^{-4} \sin^2(\theta)$.

From the options:
- The fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$.
- The form of $f$ is $\lambda^{-4}$.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
