Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Let me go through it step by step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So the starting molecule has a tert-butoxy group at position 7. The structure is probably something like norbornene with substituents.

Then, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, but wait, the starting diene might need a dienophile.

Wait the dienophile here is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. No, wait, wait. Wait, in Diels-Alder, the diene is the conjugated diene, and the dienophile is something like a carbonyl or another dienophile. But in this case, the starting compound is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which is a norbornene derivative. So that's the diene. So the dienophile would be the other molecule, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Wait, but that molecule has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. When performing a Diels-Alder, the diene (norbornene) would react with the dienophile. But this other molecule is a cyclohexadiene. Wait, no, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene. So wait, maybe the starting norbornene is the dienophile, and the cyclohexadiene is the diene? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene isn't the diene. Wait, perhaps the other molecule has a Br substituent that can act as a dienophile?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition or some other type. Or
