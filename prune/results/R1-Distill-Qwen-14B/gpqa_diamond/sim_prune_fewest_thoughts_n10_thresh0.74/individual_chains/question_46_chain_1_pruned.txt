Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining the number of possible products, excluding ethene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is involved in olefin metathesis reactions, right? So I should probably think about what that reaction entails.

Wait, Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. So, the reaction basically breaks and reforms the double bonds in the molecule. I think the general process is that the catalyst breaks the double bonds, forming metal-carbon bonds, and then recombines them in different ways.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₂CH₃)? Wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have five carbons in the main chain. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me number the pentene. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait. No, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would be a methyl group on the third carbon, so the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, the main chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1. So positions are 1 and 2 are the double bond. So, position 3 has a methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons in the main chain. Let me count: 1 (CH2-), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3)? No, wait. Wait, the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH2CH3)? No, wait. Wait, perhaps I
