Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The options are A to D, each with a different momentum value.

Wait, so first, I should remember what the fundamental state means. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. For a diatomic molecule modeled with rotation and vibration, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration.

I think the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. The total energy is the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy. But wait, in the quantum rotor model, do we consider the non-rigid rotor? Oh, the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe that affects the rotational energy. But wait, non-rigid rotor is different from the rigid one because the bond length can change, but I'm not sure how that affects the energy levels directly here.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, so that's the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the ground state for rotation is the lowest rotational energy state, which is the J=0 state. And for vibration, the ground state is the n=0 state.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it moves to the next lowest energy state. So what's the next lowest? I think in such models, the energy levels are such that the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question is about the photon causing a transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's the next state that's the smallest energy increase, which might be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, but the quantum rotation-vibration model combines both. So the energy levels are actually a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The total energy is E_rot + E_vib.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy, which would be J=0 and n=0. The next state would be the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (like J=1). So
