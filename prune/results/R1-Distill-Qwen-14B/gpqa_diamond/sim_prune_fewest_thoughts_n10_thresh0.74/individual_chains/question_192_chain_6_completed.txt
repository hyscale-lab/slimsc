Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think it through step by step.

Hmm, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity is inside it, with radius r. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and the conductor is uncharged. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is outside, so L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P. The point P is also at a distance l from the center of the cavity, and l and L are both greater than R. Oh, and there's an angle theta between l and s. So I guess the geometry is a bit tricky here.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges inside cavities. Oh right! When you have a conductor with a cavity, and you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will induce an equal and opposite charge, but wait, no, maybe not exactly. Wait, no, because the conductor was initially uncharged. So if I put a +q charge inside, the cavity's inner surface will induce a -q charge. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have +q charge induced on it, right?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. When you place a charge in the cavity, the cavity's inner surface will have an induced charge of equal magnitude but opposite sign. So the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) will have -q. But the conductor as a whole is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

So for a point outside the conductor (like point P), the electric field should be the same as if all the charge of the conductor was at the center. Because conductors shield the interior fields, but outside, the field behaves as if the charge is a point charge at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the field outside should be due to this +q. So the electric field at point P would be as if it's a point charge q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. So the field E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L².

Wait, but wait, but I thought about the charge distribution. The charge on the outer surface is +q, so when you're outside, E is due to that +q. So yes, regardless of where P is outside, the field at P depends only on the total enclosed charge inside the Gaussian surface. So the Gaussian surface here would be a sphere of radius L, which includes all the conductor and the outer charge.

So the E field is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². Let me look at the options.

Option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait, what about the position of the charge inside the cavity? The point P depends on l and the angle theta. Does that affect the field outside? Oh, but because the conductor's outer surface has a uniform charge distribution, the field outside doesn't depend on where the charge was placed inside the cavity. It's only dependent on the total charge on the outer surface. So the field at any external point is just due to the total charge +q, and the distance from the center is L. So the formula is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Charge Distribution**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (facing the cavity) induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge on the conductor is concentrated at its center. This is a property of spherical symmetry. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$, and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

3. **Gaussian Surface**: A Gaussian surface of radius $L$ centered at the conductor's center encloses the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface. By Gauss's Law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**: The position of the charge inside the cavity, as well as the distances $l$ and $s$ and the angle $\theta$, do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center.

From the given options, the correct expression for the electric field at point $P$ is:
\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
