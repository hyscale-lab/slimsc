Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on step by step. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromine atoms on the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane structure.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I think KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes via the E2 mechanism. Since it's a vicinal dihalide (two bromines on adjacent carbons?), wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So, this isn't a vicinal dihalide. Hmm, maybe this is a case for elimination to form a diene? Or perhaps a more complex reaction.

Wait, wait, maybe it's a double elimination. Because the molecule has two bromine atoms, perhaps each undergoes an E2 elimination. But how? Oh, wait, KOH could deprotonate and abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But with two bromines, maybe two eliminations happen. Let me think. Each Br could leave with a β-hydrogen being abstracted, forming two double bonds. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. What product is formed when a dihalide, especially a 1,3-dihalide, reacts with KOH?

Oh, wait! Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation. So, two E2 reactions. Each Br leaves, and each elimination forms a double bond. So, the product would have two double bonds. But wait, I'm not sure because the structure of adamantane is pretty rigid. Alternatively, perhaps each bromine is on a bridgehead, and elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not favorable due to Bredt's rule. Hmm, maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But with KOH, substitution would require a good leaving group and a good base. Wait, but substitution would lead to a diol, but the product here is described as having an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is around the carbonyl (C=O) region. Oh, that's a key point.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests the presence of a carbonyl group. So, the product after KOH treatment probably has a ketone or ester or something with a carbonyl. But how does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Oh, perhaps the KOH is causing an elimination to form a ketone. Wait, no, elimination usually forms alkenes. Wait, maybe oxidation? But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement
