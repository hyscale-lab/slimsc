Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I need to use special relativity equations. 

The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so I'll probably have to calculate each part and then match the answers.

First, let's break down the problem. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. Wait, wait, both in the positive x-direction. So, from the perspective of one astronaut, what's the speed of the other?

I recall that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. The relative velocity formula is different. The formula for relative velocity (u') when two objects are moving at velocities u and v relative to a rest frame is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, which one is moving which? Oh right, because both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed v_rel is the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, same direction. So from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. That's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel around 0.14c. So that might narrow things down.

Now, for the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, each astronaut has their own energy. So
