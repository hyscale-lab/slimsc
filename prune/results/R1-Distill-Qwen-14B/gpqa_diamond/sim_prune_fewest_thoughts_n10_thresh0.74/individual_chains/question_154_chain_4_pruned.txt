Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The options are A to D, all different chloro-substituted compounds with benzene rings.

First, let's look at the data given. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Wait, molecular ion plus 2? Maybe some kind of isotope? Chlorine has a significant natural abundance for the M+2 peak, so if the molecule has one Cl atom, we'd see peaks at m/z for M and M+2. Let me calculate the molecular weight.

The molecular ion is 156. So the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of around 156. Let me look at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its formula. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl and OH groups. Wait, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would be C7H5ClO2. Let's see the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So total is 84+5+35.5+32=156.5. Hmm, close enough for a molecular ion at 156. Then the M+2 would be 158, which matches the data. So this could be a possibility.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5H=5, 35.5, 2*16=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32=156.5. So same as option A. So the molecular ion fits. Also, M+2 at 158, so that's possible.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The formula would be C6H5ClO2CO. Wait, no. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A and B. Molecular weight same, so M at 156.5. So, same possibilities here.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. So same molecular weight as others, which matches the molecular ion. So all options have the same molecular formula? Wait, but wait, looking at the options more closely: the molecular formulas might vary based on functional groups.

Wait,
