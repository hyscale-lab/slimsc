Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, they're asking what the probability is after 50 minutes have passed without decay, and then looking into the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused. So, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the initial 32% decay probability is given for 100 minutes. How does that translate?

I think I need to use the concept of half-life or maybe the decay constant. Oh wait, maybe it's better to model this with the decay formula. The decay follows an exponential law, right? So the number of undecayed nuclei over time is given by N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

But wait, the problem gives a probability of decay in a certain time. So the probability P that the atom decays within time t is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt). Or is it the other way around? Let me think. If P is the probability of decay, then the survival probability is 1 - P, which equals e^(-λt). So P = 1 - e^(-λt).

In the problem, P is 32% for t = 100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let's solve for λ.

Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is negative. Let me calculate it:

ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability that it will
