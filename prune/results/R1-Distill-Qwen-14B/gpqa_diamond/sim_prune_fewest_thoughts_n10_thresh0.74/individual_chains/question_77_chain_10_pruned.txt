Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what I've got here. There are two reactions given, and I need to determine the major products A and B. Then, match them with the options provided.

First, let me look at the first reaction:

The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Hmm, I remember that BuLi is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions, especially in organometallic chemistry. Let's break this down.

The starting molecule has a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxygen (oxy) connected to a methyl group, which is then connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-? Wait, no. Let me draw this.

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But since it's 3-methyl, there's a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2-CH(C H2CH3)-CH2. Wait, but actually, the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl, meaning the double bond is between C2 and C3, and there's a methyl on C3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-.

Wait, but 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=C(CH2
