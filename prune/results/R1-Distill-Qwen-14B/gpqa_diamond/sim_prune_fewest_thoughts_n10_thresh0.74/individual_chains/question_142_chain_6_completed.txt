Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|), but when you have a mixture, like a statistical ensemble, it's a combination of such projectors, each multiplied by their probability.

So, this ρ looks like it's an equal mixture of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Because each term is multiplied by 1/2, right? So each has a probability of 50%. That makes sense because |0⟩⟨0| has a trace of 1 and is a projector, same with |1⟩⟨1|.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, qubits can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of a qubit state. Each point on the unit sphere corresponds to a pure state, and the density matrix for mixed states can be represented as points within the sphere, weighted by their probabilities.

So for a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector r would be (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For example, |0⟩ would have r=(0,0,1), because it's along the positive z-axis. Similarly, |1⟩ would be (0,0,-1), but wait, no, because |1⟩ is often written as (0,0,1) as well? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the standard representation is that |0⟩ is (1,0,0) in the Bloch sphere? No, wait, no, no. I think the Bloch vector for |0⟩ is actually (0,0,1) along the z-axis. Similarly, |1⟩ is (0,0,-1). Wait, no—hold on. Wait, perhaps I got that mixed up.

Wait, the Bloch vector is given by the expectation values. The density matrix is diagonal in the computational basis. For a pure state |0⟩, the density matrix is |0⟩⟨0|, which is diagonal with entries [1,0]. The Bloch vector is calculated from the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are X, Y, Z.

The expectation value of σ_x for |0⟩ is ⟨0|σ_x|0⟩. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying |0⟩ gives |1⟩, so ⟨0|σ_x|0⟩ is 0. Same for σ_y. For σ_z, it's [[1,0],[0,-1]], so ⟨0|σ_z|0⟩ is 1. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,1). So |0⟩ is at (0,0,1), and |1⟩ is (0,0,-1).

Wait, but in this problem, the density matrix is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with ½ probability. So the Bloch vector for ρ would be the average of the Bloch vectors of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each weighted by their probabilities.

So each pure state contributes (½)( (0,0,1) + (0,0,-1) ) → (0,0,0). Because ½(1 + (-1)) = 0. So the Bloch vector for ρ is at the origin.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the density matrix for a mixed state is a statistical mixture. So the density matrix ρ = ½ (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) equals ½ I, where I is the identity matrix. And for a density matrix, the Bloch vector is calculated as r = (⟨X⟩, ⟨Y⟩, ⟨Z⟩), but for a mixed state, the expectation values are taken as Tr(ρ σ_x), etc.

So let's compute Tr(ρ σ_x). σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ρ is (1/2) ( [[1,0],[0,0]] + [[0,0],[0,1]] ) = (1/2) [[1,0],[0,1]] → which is (1/2) I.

So when we compute Tr(ρ σ_x) = (1/2) Tr( I σ_x ) = (1/2) Tr(σ_x) → but the trace of σ_x is zero, because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]] → trace is 0+0 =0.

Similarly for σ_y and σ_z. So all components x, y, z are zero. So the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin. So that's option C.

Looking at the options:

A) r=(1,1,0) → that would be a point outside the Bloch sphere. But wait, the Bloch vector has length <=1. The origin is (0,0,0), so option C is correct.

So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

which represents an equal mixture of the pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with a probability of \(1/2\). In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states correspond to points on the unit sphere, while mixed states correspond to points inside the sphere. 

For a pure state \(|0\rangle\), the Bloch vector is \((0, 0, 1)\), and for \(|1\rangle\), it is \((0, 0, -1)\). Since the density matrix \(\rho\) is a statistical mixture of these two states, the Bloch vector for \(\rho\) is the weighted average of the Bloch vectors of \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), with weights \(1/2\) each. Thus:

\[
r = \frac{1}{2}(0, 0, 1) + \frac{1}{2}(0, 0, -1) = (0, 0, 0).
\]

This means the geometrical position of \(\rho\) in the qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

A) \(r=(1,1,0)\) — Incorrect, as this point lies outside the Bloch sphere.  
B) \(r=(0,0,1)\) — Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\).  
C) \(r=(0,0,0)\) — Correct, as this corresponds to the mixed state \(\rho\).  
D) \(r=(1,1,1)\) — Incorrect, as this point lies outside the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
