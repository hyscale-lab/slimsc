Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Then it undergoes bromination in CCl4 to form Compound B. I remember that C3H6 can be either propene or cyclopropane, but propene is more likely because CCl4 is a solvent for addition reactions, not substitution. Oh wait, cyclopropane is more reactive towards bromination under certain conditions, but I'm a bit confused. Hmm, but wait, propene is more common in such reactions. So, propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add bromine (Br2) in CCl4, probably a dibromination if it's an alkene. Wait, no, wait. The reaction of propene with bromine in CCl4 is probably an addition reaction, so it becomes 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B would be CH2BrCHBrCH3. Wait, or is it CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. When bromine adds across the double bond, it would add Br to each carbon. So the product is 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Then, when Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms Compound C. Alcoholic KOH usually indicates an elimination reaction. So B is a vicinal dibromide. When you treat vicinal dibromides with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation, elimination of two HBr molecules, forming an alkene. So the product would be back to propene, but wait, where? Let me think. The structure of B is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When KOH removes H from adjacent C's, it would form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving back propene (CH2=CHCH3). So Compound C is propene.

Next, Compound C passes through a red-hot iron tube to form D. Red-hot iron is used in the dehydrogenation or possibly a catalytic process. Wait, propene (CH2=CHCH3) when passed through a red-hot iron tube might undergo dehydrogenation to form propene's corresponding alkene, but wait, propene
