Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Hmm, the question is about the transit method for detecting exoplanets. So, the researchers are trying to decide which planet to observe, Planet_1 or Planet_2, to maximize their chances of detecting a transit. They have limited time, so they need to pick the one with the higher probability of transiting.

Both planets have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, and their masses are the same. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting, so even though Planet_1's star is more massive, they're the same size. That might have something to do with it.

Wait, so what determines the probability of a planet transiting? I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The transit probability (p) is approximately (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by ( (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3) ) / (a_planet / (R_star * (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) )) )) or something like that? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by the formula p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_star / a) ) / (something else? Or maybe more accurately, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s) / a ) ), because the star's radius is R_s and the planet's orbital distance a.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for transit probability. Oh right, I can't look things up, but I remember that the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s) / a ) )? No, wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula
