Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We're also told to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) in the photosphere.

Hmm. So, I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system in equilibrium. The Boltzmann factor is used to determine the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of particles in the two energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is cooler (with spots), the ratio n2/n1 is lower than when it's hotter. That makes sense because in lower temperatures, particles have less thermal energy, so they are less likely to be excited to higher energy levels. So, higher temperatures should lead to a higher ratio.

Wait, but wait. The ratio here is (n2)/(n1), right? If the temperature is lower (because spots make the overall T lower), then the exponent becomes a larger negative number, so the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, Teff is 5500 K, so the ratio is lower than when it's 6000 K without spots.

So, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So, factor = (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So, (n2/n1)_no_spots is higher than (n2/n1)_with_spots. Therefore, the factor would be greater than 1.

So, the factor is [(g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T_no_spots))] / [(g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T_with_spots))] ) = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T_with_spots -
