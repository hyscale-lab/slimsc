Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given IR and NMR data.

First, the IR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1 due to the carbonyl group (C=O). So, the compound has an ester functional group somewhere.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are six signals. Let me break them down:

1. Two signals correspond to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons would split into different signals based on their positions. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, there would be two sets of aromatic protons (like ortho and meta), but wait, that's when there's only one substituent. Wait, no, when it's di-substituted, the pattern can vary. Maybe it's something like meta or para substitution, leading to two different groups of aromatic protons, each with their own coupling. So, two signals for aromatic H makes sense.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or an aromatic ring. But wait, in an aromatic ring, the protons are typically part of the ring, but in this case, the vinyl-H might be part of another group, like an ester group. For example, maybe an ethyl ester or something similar. So, two signals here: one is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, what could that mean? A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets would be more complex; maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to something else. Maybe the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent, like an allyl group or something.

3. Two signals for -CH3 groups. So, there are two different methyl groups. And importantly, there are no signals for -CH2 groups. That suggests that any CH2 groups are either not present or are in a symmetric environment where their protons are equivalent and don't show up as separate signals. Wait, but if there are two -CH3 groups, their signals would be split if they are in different environments. So, maybe each -CH3 is attached to something different.

Putting this together, the compound is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and perhaps another substituent. Let's think about the structure. An ester group is R-O-CO-R'. For example, maybe one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-OR, and the other substituent is a vinyl group or another group with CH3 groups.

Wait, but the two -CH3 groupsâ€”so maybe the ester part has a methyl group. For example, methyl something ester. Also, the vinyl groups could be part of another substituent, perhaps a vinyl group attached to the ring, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the benzene are an ester group (like O-CO-OR) and another group that has vinyl protons and methyl groups. Wait, but each substituent would bring their own groups.

Wait, the di-substituted benzene could have substituents like an ester and another group that has a vinyl and methyl groups. For example, maybe one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-OCH2CH3, but that's an ethyl ester), and another substituent is a methyl group attached via a double bond? No, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group (like O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the substituents as an ester group and
