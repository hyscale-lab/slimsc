Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'll walk through my thought process step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B from each. Then, I have to match them with the given options.

First, let's look at Reaction 1:
1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH (which is potassium hydride), and then H+.

Hmm, I remember that when alcohols are treated with a strong base like KH, it can lead to elimination reactions, especially if the alcohol is in an acidic position. So maybe this is a dehydrohalogenation or something similar, but wait, in this case, it's an alcohol. Oh, right, it might be an E2 elimination. Wait, but wait, the starting material is an alcohol. So, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed dehydration? Or is it a base-induced elimination?

Wait, THF is a solvent, and KH is a strong base. So the reaction conditions are probably basic. So the alcohol (which is a good leaving group after deprotonation?) Wait, but wait, alcohols aren't great leaving groups. Wait, but in the presence of a strong base like potassium hydride, maybe the alcohol is deprotonated to form an alkoxide. Then, perhaps an elimination occurs.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, in this case, the spiro is at position 1, so that's where the two rings meet. The structure has a vinyl group (a double bond attached to CH2) attached to the spiro atom. So the molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol.

Wait, so the structure: the spiro is between a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring? Or wait, wait, the formula is spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro is at position 1, so the molecule has a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring attached at position 1. So, the 3.5 means that the spiro is connected to a 3 carbon ring
