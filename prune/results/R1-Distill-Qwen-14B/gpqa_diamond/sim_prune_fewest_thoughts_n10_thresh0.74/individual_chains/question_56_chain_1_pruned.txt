Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Dipole transitions are electric dipole transitions, right? The selection rules for that are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So we're going from n=3 to n=1, which is a drop of two energy levels. But since each dipole transition can only change n by 1 (since each photon emission or absorption usually changes n by one), this decay must happen in two steps. So the first transition would be from n=3 to n=2, and then from n=2 to n=1.

So the possible intermediate states are the states with n=2, l either 1 or 0? Wait, no. Wait, when you have an n=3 state (l=0), the possible l for n=2 would be l=1, because l can be from 0 to n-1. So n=2, l can be 0 or 1, but wait, for a dipole transition, Δl must be ±1. So from l=0 (initial state), the next state must have l=1. So the first transition would be from l=0 to l=1, so the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1. Then the second transition would be from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> because l has to go from 1 to 0, which is Δl = -1, which is allowed.

Wait, but can the m change? Let me think. For the first transition, from l=0 to l=1, Δl=+1. The m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So the first step could go to m=0, +1, or -1. Then in the second step, from l=1 to l=0, Δl=-1, and m must change by 0, +1, or -1. So the initial m in the intermediate state affects the possible m in the final state.

The initial state |3,0,0> has m=0. So after the first transition, m can be 0, +1, or -1. The second transition will take that m to m_final. But the final state is |1,0,0>, which has m=0. So we need to find transitions where the sum of the m changes across the two steps leads to m=0.

Let me think about each possible intermediate state:

1. If the first transition goes to |2,1,1>, then in the second step, m can change by -1, 0, or +1. To get m=0 in the final state, the second transition must change m by -1. So from m=1 to m=0. That's allowed because Δm can be -1. So this is a possible path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0.

2. Similarly, if the first transition is to |2,1,-1>, then in the second transition, m would need to increase by +1 to reach m=0. So that's allowed. So another possible path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0.

3. What about going to |2
