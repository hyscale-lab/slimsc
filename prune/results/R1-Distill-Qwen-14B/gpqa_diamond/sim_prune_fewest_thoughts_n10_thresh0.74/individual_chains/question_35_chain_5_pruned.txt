Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given by c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π), where h is probably Planck's constant. Wait, no—wait, sometimes people use ħ, which is h/(2π). Oh, but here c is h/(4π), so that's ħ/2. Because ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. Okay, that might come into play later.

The matrix S is given as the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). I remember that for spin matrices, the Pauli matrices are involved. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Wait, but S here doesn't look like any of those. Let me write down Pauli matrices to compare.

Pauli matrices are:
σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Oh wait, the matrix S given here is σy. Because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly σy. So S = σy.

So the operator A_y is c multiplied by σy. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σy.

But wait, the standard angular momentum operator for spin is typically written as A = ħ S, where S is the spin matrix. Oh, since ħ is h/(2π), then A = (h/(2π)) * S. But in this problem, c is h/(4π), which is ħ/2. So A_y = (ħ/2) * σy.

Wait, but I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. For spin-½ particles, the angular momentum operator is A = ħ/2 * σ, because the eigenvalues for spin are ± ħ/2. Oh, right! So each component of the angular momentum is (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrix.

So in this case, A_y is (ħ/2) * σy. Because ħ is h/(2π), so substituting, that becomes (h/(4π)) * σy, which matches the given c= h/(4π). So that's correct.

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to solve Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

First, let's write down the matrix for A_y.

A_y = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

But wait, let me compute this matrix. Multiply each element
