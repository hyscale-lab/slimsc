Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets using the TTV method, but I think the main thing here is the orbital periods and how that relates to temperature. 

Alright, the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, each planet's period is a multiple of the first planet's. Planet 1 has the shortest period, meaning it's closest to the star, right? Because closer planets orbit faster, right? So the order is Planet 1, then 2,3,4,5 from the star.

The question asks for the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet 4 and Planet 2. Equilibrium temperature... Oh yeah, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the inverse square law. The temperature depends on the distance from the star. 

The formula I remember is T = T_earth * (L / (16πσ D²))^(1/4), but wait, maybe I can think of it more simply. The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L / (16πσ D²))^(1/4), but since all the planets are around the same star, L and σ are constants. So T is proportional to (1/D^2)^(1/4), which simplifies. Let me think, (1/D^2) is D^(-2), so the fourth root of that is D^(-0.5). So T is proportional to 1 / sqrt(D). So the further away, the lower the temperature.

Alternatively, another way: the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. The equilibrium temperature is based on the energy balance, so T scales with (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4) which is (1/D²)^(1/4) = 1/D^(1/2). So T ~ 1/sqrt(D). 

But wait, the orbital period is related to distance via Kepler's third law. The law says that P² is proportional to D³. So P² ∝ D³ → D ∝ P^(2/3). Because for a star like our Sun, P² = (4π²/GM) * D³, so D = (G*M/(4π²))^(1/3) * P^(2/3). Since all planets are around the same star, M is the same for all, so D is proportional to P^(2/3).

So D for each planet is proportional to P^(2/3). Since the albedo is the same for all, it doesn't affect the calculation because the albedo affects the absorbed vs reflected light, but since it's the same, we can ignore it for this ratio calculation.

So, let's find the D for each planet. The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let's assign P1 = P, so P2=2P, P3=2.5P, P4=3.5P, P5=5P. 

But since D is proportional to P^(2/3), let's compute the ratio of D for each planet.

D1 ∝ P^(2/3) → for P1 = P, D1 ∝ 1.

D2 ∝ (2P)^(2/3) = 2^(2/3) * D1.

D3 ∝ (2.5P)^(2/3) = (5/2)^(2/3) * D1.

D4 ∝ (3.5P)^(2/3) = (7/2)^(2/3) * D1.

D5 ∝ (5P)^(2/3) =5^(2/3) * D1.

But we need the ratio between Planet 4 and Planet 2. So D4/D2 = [ (3.5)^(2/3) ] / [ (2)^(2/3) ) ].

Wait, because D4 = (3.5P)^(2/3) and D2 = (2P)^(2/3). So the ratio D4/D2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3).

Calculating 3.5 /2 is 1.75. So (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

Alternatively, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3) = ( (7/4)^(1/3) )^2.

The cube root of 7/4. Let me think, 7/4 is 1.75. Cube root of 1.75 is approximately what? Well, 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is roughly 1.2. So (1.2)^2 is about 1.44. So D4/D2 ≈ 1.44. So D4 is 1.44 times D2.

Wait, but I think I should be more precise. Let me compute 1.75^(2/3):

Take natural logs: (2/3)*ln(1.75) ≈ (2/3)*0.5596 ≈ 0.373. e^0.373 ≈ 1.453. So approximately 1.453. So D4 is about 1.453 times D2.

But wait, that's D4/D2. Since T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), the ratio of T4 to T2 is sqrt( D2 / D4 ). Because T = k / sqrt(D) → T4/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D4 ) = sqrt( 1/(D4/D2) ) = 1 / sqrt(D4/D2).

So D4/D2 is approximately 1.453. So sqrt( D4/D2 ) is sqrt(1.453) ≈ 1.206. So T4/T2 is 1/1.206 ≈ 0.829. So approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check the math. Let me recalculate:

Compute D4/D2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). P4 is 3.5 * P1, P2 is 2 * P1. So P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75. So D4/D2 = (1.75)^(2/3).

Wait, another approach: 1.75 is 7/4, so (7/4)^(2/3) is equal to (7^(2/3))/(4^(2/3)).

7^(1/3) is approximately 1.913. So 7^(2/3) is about (1.913)^2 ≈ 3.66.

4^(1/3) is approximately 1.587. So 4^(2/3) is about (1.587)^2 ≈ 2.5198.

So 3.66 / 2.5198 ≈ 1.453. So D4
