Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what I've got. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO, and there's some NMR data provided. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, let me parse the information. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Hmm, the molecular formula might give some clues about the structure.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet integrating for one proton. High chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the structure. Wait, but sometimes other groups can be around there, like an aromatic proton in certain environments, but I think aldehyde is more likely here.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet with 2 hydrogens. Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted. Maybe two equivalent protons in a benzene ring, which would be a pair of doublets if it's a para-substituted ring. Or perhaps part of a conjugated system.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet for 2H. Maybe another aromatic ring, or substituents on the same ring as the first set. If the first is at 6.98 (downfield), this is a bit upfield, so maybe another ring with substituents or maybe part of a conjugated diene.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but wait, that's 2H. Hmm, or maybe it's part of a vinyl group or another conjugated system. Alternatively, could be an aromatic ring with some substituents that cause a broad splitting, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet integrating for 2H. That's around the region for CH2 groups, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom. A methylene group next to oxygen maybe
