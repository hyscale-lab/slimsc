Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. 

The question says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each of these particles has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”just potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. So point P is some fixed spot. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So I guess that 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are arranged around it, each 2 meters away. Or maybe they're all at 2 meters from P, so P is a point in space where one charge is fixed, and the others are 2 m away from it.

Wait, the problem says the 13th is fixed at P. So the other 12 are each at 2 m from P. So the setup is that 12 charges are placed at 2 m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the system is made up of these 13 charges.

Now the question is about the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, so I think we're looking for the electrostatic potential energy of the system. Because in an isolated system, the potential energy would be a measure of the energy stored due to their positions. And since the charges are fixed (except for maybe the 12 being constrained but I think their positions are fixed), the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

But wait, the system's minimum energy. Hmm. So perhaps there's a way the charges can be arranged to have the least possible potential energy. But in this case, the setup is given: 12 are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So maybe the system's energy is fixed given that arrangement, and we just need to calculate it.

Wait, no, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed, so the system's configuration is fixed as well. So the energy is determined by that configuration.

So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait
