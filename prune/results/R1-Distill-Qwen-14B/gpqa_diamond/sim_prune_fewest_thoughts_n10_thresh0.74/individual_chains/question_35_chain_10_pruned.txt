Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to spin matrices. The problem says that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, I think S is a 2x2 matrix given here. The first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Right, that's the matrix for S. And Ay is c multiplied by this. So first, let me write out Ay. Since c is h/(4π), then Ay is [ [0, -i h/(4π) ], [i h/(4π), 0 ] ].

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. 

So let's set up the matrix Ay - λ I. That would be:

[ -λ,   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π),  -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π))]. Let's compute that.

The (1,1) element is -λ, (1,2) is -i h/(4π), (2,1) is i h/(4π), and (2,2) is -λ.

So determinant is λ^2 - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ].

Wait, what's (-i)(i)? Oh, because the off-diagonal terms when multiplied are (-i)(i) multiplied by (h/(4π))^2. Let's compute that. (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ^2 - (1)*(h^2)/(16 π²) = λ^2 - (h²)/(16 π²).

Set this equal to zero: λ² = (h²)/(16 π²
