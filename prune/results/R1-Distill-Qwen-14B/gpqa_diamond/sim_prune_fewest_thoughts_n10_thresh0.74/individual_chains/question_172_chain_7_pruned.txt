Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Let me try to break this down.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the number of excited atoms in a specific energy level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of -(ΔE)/(k*T). Oh right, the equation is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this case, the excited state is higher, so maybe star_1 has more atoms in the upper energy level compared to the lower. Let me think: the ratio for star 1 would be n1_upper/n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and for star 2, n2_upper/n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. I think that means the population in the excited state is twice that of star_2. So maybe n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower)?

Wait no, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation level is such that the ratio (n_upper)/(n_lower) is twice as high in star_1 than in star_2. So let me define the ratio for each star.

Let’s denote the ratio for star 1 as R1 = 2 * R2, where R2 is the ratio for star 2. Because the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. Wait, actually, the problem says "twice as excited", which might mean that the excitation level is higher. So perhaps the population in the upper state is higher for star_1.

Alternatively, maybe it's that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So if n1_upper
