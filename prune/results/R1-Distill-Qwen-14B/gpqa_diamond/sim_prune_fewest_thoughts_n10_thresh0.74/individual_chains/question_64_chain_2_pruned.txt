Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases formed. These gases were then passed through three tubes successively. 

Tube 1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent and can react with water. So if there's any water vapor in the gas mixture, it would be absorbed here. The weight increased by 3.60 grams, which suggests that some water was present in the gases.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. Well, Ca(OH)2 is a base. It would react with acidic gases like CO2. If the weight didn't change, maybe no CO2 was present, or it reacted but didn't affect the solution because maybe it was in excess or something. Or perhaps the gas didn't react with the base, but I'm not sure.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. I think when gases pass through hot copper, any CO (carbon monoxide) would react with it. The reaction is CO + Cu → CO2 + Cu. The weight of tube 3 increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. So the increase would be due to the CO reacting. The product is CO2 and CuO. 

After all that, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). STP conditions mean 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. That suggests gas C is something with 0.1 moles left.

So, let's start analyzing each part.

First, the gases produced when salts A and B are heated. Since they're salts, heating them likely causes them to decompose. Common decomposition products from salts are gases like CO2, H2O (as steam), SO2, NO, CO, NH3, etc. 

Looking at the first tube: Mg(ClO4)2 absorbed water, increasing by 3.60g. So the water is H2O. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60g is 3.60 /18 = 0.2 moles of H2O. So the original gas mixture had 0.2 moles of H2O.

Next, tube 3 reacts with CO. The reaction is CO + Cu → CO2 + Cu. The mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80g. The increase is due to the production of CuO. Let's see: the reaction produces one mole of CuO for each mole of CO consumed. The molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (Cu=63.55, O=16). So 0.80g of CuO is 0.80 /80 = 0.01 moles. So 0.01 moles of CO were present. 

So, CO was 0.01 moles. Then, as it passes through tube 3, it's converted to CO2. So the CO2 from tube 3 would go into the next step.

But wait, let's think about this. The initial gas mixture would have H2O, CO, and maybe other gases like CO2 or NH3, etc.

Wait, tube 2 was Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas didn't react, that suggests that the gas wasn't acidic enough to react with the base. Alternatively, maybe the CO2 was already consumed. Or perhaps not. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the gas passed through tube 2 didn't react because the CO2 was either not present or was already converted. Hmm.

Wait, let's outline what each tube does:

1. Mg(ClO4)2: Soaks up water (H2O). So if any H2O was present, it's removed here. The mass gain is 3.60g, so 0.2 moles H2O.

2. Ca(OH)2: Reacts with CO2, SO2, HCl, etc. If the mass didn't change, perhaps no CO2 was present, or all of it was consumed. Or maybe the solution was in excess and couldn't absorb more. Alternatively, maybe the gas didn't have any of those gases.

Wait, but after the first tube, the gas mixture would have the non-water components. Maybe the CO2 is in the gas after H2O is removed.

But then, the tube 2 was Ca(OH)2 solution. If CO2 was present, it would react: CO2 + 2 OH- → CO3^2- + H2O. But the solution's mass didn't change. So either no CO2 or it was somehow not reacting. That's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the CO2 was consumed elsewhere. For example, in the reaction with Cu in tube 3. But wait, that only applies to CO, not CO2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the CO2 in the gas mixture comes from the decomposition of the salts or from the reaction in tube 3.

Hold on, the final gas C is 2.24 L at STP, which is 0.1 moles. So whatever gas C is, it's 0.1 moles. 

Let me try to sum up the possible reactions:

Salt A and Salt B decompose upon heating. Let's suppose they produce H2O, CO, and something else. 

But the initial gas mixture includes H2O (as steam), CO, and perhaps CO2 or another gas.

Wait, but after the first tube, the H2O is absorbed. So the gas that goes into tube 2 is the non-water components. If tube 2's Ca(OH)2 didn't react, then perhaps the gas mixture after H2O removal doesn't have CO2. Or maybe tube 2 couldn't absorb CO2 because something else happened.

Wait, could the CO2 have been consumed in another reaction? Or perhaps the gas also contains NH3, which is a base and wouldn't react with Ca(OH)2.

Alternatively, maybe the initial gases were CO and H2O. Then, after tube 1, only CO remains. Then tube 3 reacts CO with Cu to CO2, which would be absorbed by the next step. But
