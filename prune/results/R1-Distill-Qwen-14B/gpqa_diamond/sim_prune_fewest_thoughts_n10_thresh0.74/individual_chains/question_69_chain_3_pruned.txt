Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime is important in determining how far they travel before decaying. But wait, the problem gives me the proper lifetime, which is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So I think I need to consider the particle's velocity and the time it experiences due to time dilation.

Wait, the question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, I'm guessing that the bubble chamber can only detect decays that happen within a certain distance, and if the particle travels too far, it decays beyond the detection limit. So, I need to find what fraction of the decays happen within a certain distance, and then find the distance that captures at least 30% (so 0.3) of them.

Let me try to outline the steps. First, I'll find the speed of the particle X⁰. Since it's moving in the bubble chamber with energy given, I can calculate its velocity. Then, using time dilation, I can find the lifetime as observed in the lab frame. Then, the distance it travels before decaying is speed multiplied by lifetime. But wait, I think I need to calculate the average path length, or maybe the distance where a certain fraction (like 30%) of the decays occur.

Wait, the proper lifetime is τ0, which is 8e-16 seconds. The particle's lifetime as observed in the lab would be gamma times τ0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is E/(m c²), I think. Oh wait, the energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be E / (m c²), right? Because E = gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) ≈ 7.91. Let me compute that more accurately: 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.917.

So gamma is about 7.917. Then, the lab frame lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ0. So τ = 7.917 * 8e-16 s = approx 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Now, the particle's speed v. Since gamma is 7.917, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me solve for v. So, gamma squared is 1/(1 - (v²/c²)). So 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma². Gamma squared is about (7.917)^2 ≈ 62.68. So 1/gamma² is 1/62.68 ≈ 0.016. So 1 - v²/c² = 0.016 → v²/c² = 0.984 → v = sqrt(0.984) * c ≈ 0.992c.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should calculate it more precisely. Alternatively, perhaps using
