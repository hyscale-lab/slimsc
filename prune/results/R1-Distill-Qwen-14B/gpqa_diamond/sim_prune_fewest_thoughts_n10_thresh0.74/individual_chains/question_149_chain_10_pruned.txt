Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly correct except for two peaks that both belong to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is expected. So why are they appearing as two separate peaks? Also, they ruled out spin-spin coupling as the cause because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that.

Then there's the LC-MS analysis. It shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum as the expected molecule. So the mass is the same, but the retention time is different. At elevated temperature, maybe the compounds are not separating well, but here they do. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR part: same alpha-proton appearing as two peaks. If they're not split due to coupling, maybe it's some kind of isomerism. Enantiomers or diastereomers. Enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra because they're mirror images, so the same peaks. Diastereomers would have different NMR shifts. Wait, but in the question, the two peaks are for the same proton and have similar shifts. That's a bit confusing.

Wait, another thought. If the molecule has a stereocenter, maybe it's a mixture of diastereomers. But wait, diastereomers would show different peaks for each proton. But here, the same alpha proton is appearing as two separate peaks. So maybe it's a case of epimers or something else.

Wait, but if there's a mixture of enantiomers, the NMR would show all the same peaks because enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. So that can't explain two peaks for the same proton. Unless... wait, no, that can't be. Enantiomers would appear as a single peak because NMR can't distinguish them. So option B (enantiomers) might not explain the NMR observation.

What about diastereomers? Suppose there are multiple stereoisomers. Each would have different shifts. But in this scenario, the alpha proton's split into two peaks with similar shifts. So maybe diastereomers with two different configurations that affect the alpha proton similarly but not completely the same.

Wait, another angle: the question says the two peaks correspond to the
