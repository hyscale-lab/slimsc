Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential, specifically V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Hmm, I remember that this potential is like a 3D harmonic oscillator. Oh right, because in one dimension, a harmonic oscillator has that potential, and in three dimensions, it's just the sum in each direction, but since it's isotropic, it depends only on r, the radial distance.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

I think I should start by recalling the energy levels of a 3D harmonic oscillator. I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, so in 3D, the energy is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Or wait, sometimes it's written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. Or more accurately, the principal quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z, and each n_x, n_y, n_z is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but sometimes the formula is written as E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So for each dimension, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so when you add them up, you get (n + 3/2) ħω where n is n_x + n_y + n_z.

Now, the third excited state. Hmm, wait. The ground state is the lowest energy. So the ground state would be when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. That's n=0, so E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = 3/2 ħω.

The first excited state would be the next higher energy. So which comes next? The possible states with n=1. But wait, n is the sum of the quantum numbers. So how many states are there with n=1? Well, the possible combinations are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So three states. So each state in n=1 has energy (1 + 3/2) ħω = 5/2 ħω.

Then the second excited state would be n=2. Let's see. How many states? The number of states for a given n is (n+1)(n+2)/2, or maybe I'm mixing that up. Wait, no, for three dimensions, the number of states with quantum number sum n is (n+2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. Wait, no, that formula gives the number for two dimensions, I think. For three dimensions, it's (n + 2)(n + 1)/2? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think: for n=0, only one state (0,0,0). For n=1, 3 states. For n=2, the number of states is 6. Because the possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) are permutations where their sum is 2. So (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). So that's 3 + 3 =6 states. So yes, for n=2, 6 states.

Wait, but each n level has a certain number of states, and each state corresponds to a particular (n_x, n_y, n_z) triplet. So the energy for n=2 is (2 + 3/2) = 7/2 ħω.

Wait, but the question is about the third excited state. Let's clarify: the ground state is the first state, then each excited state is the next higher energy. So the ground state is the zeroth excited state. The first excited state is the first higher energy, which is n=1, and the second excited is n=2, third excited would be n=3.

Wait, wait. No, I think the counting is: the ground state is the state with the lowest energy, n=0. Then the first excited state is the next higher energy, which is n=1. The second excited state is n=2, and the third excited state would be n=3. So the energy we're looking for is for n=3.

So for n=3, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/
