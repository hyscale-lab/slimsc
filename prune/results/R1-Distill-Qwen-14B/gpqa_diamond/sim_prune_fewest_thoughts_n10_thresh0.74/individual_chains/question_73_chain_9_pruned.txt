Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit at c. And energy calculations involve gamma factors.

So, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait, are they moving in the same direction? I think so, yes. So the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, but I need to find their relative speed. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. No, wait a second. Wait, actually, no, the problem says "relative speed" which probably means the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. Because if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference divided by (1 + something), but wait, no, in relativity, it's not just subtraction.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. So, when you have two objects moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't simply the difference. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u and v are the speeds of the two objects in the same frame. So, in this case, if both are moving in the same direction, say the first is moving at 0.6c and the second at 0.5c, then from the first astronaut's frame, the second would appear to be moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/(c²)), where u' is the speed of the object in the original frame, and v is the speed of the frame itself. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the frame of the first astronaut, so the speed of the second astronaut in that frame is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5
