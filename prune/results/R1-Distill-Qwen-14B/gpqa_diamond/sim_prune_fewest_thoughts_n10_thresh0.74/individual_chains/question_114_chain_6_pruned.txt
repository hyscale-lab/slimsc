Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible A and B reagents.

Hmm, I remember that NaCN is a nucleophile. So in the first reaction, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to a ketone. Wait, ketones can undergo nucleophilic additions, right? So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If NaCN adds to it, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, what's the typical product? I think it forms a cyanohydrin. Oh right! The cyanohydrin formation. So when a ketone reacts with HCN or a cyanide salt like NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

So the first reaction's product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Yep, that makes sense.

Now, what reagent A is needed for this? I remember that the formation of cyanohydrin typically uses an acid catalyst. So H3O+ (like in option A or B) is a possible choice. Alternatively, could it be something else? Another possibility is using H2SO4, but the options don't have that. Wait, the options have H3O+ or NaHSO3 as options.

So for the first part, A is likely H3O+ since that's the acid catalyst. So in options A and B, A is H3O+.

Moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2
