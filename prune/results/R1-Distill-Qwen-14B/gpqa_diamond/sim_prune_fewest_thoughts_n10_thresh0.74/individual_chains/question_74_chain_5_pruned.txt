Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, but it follows certain statistical rules. Let me think about what the question is asking.

The question says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it has decayed. That means the probability it hasn't decayed is 68% because 100% minus 32% is 68%. 

But wait, the situation here is different. It says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now, we're supposed to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the total time we're looking at is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the initial probability was given for 100 minutes. Hmmm.

I think radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The probability of decay doesn't depend on the time already elapsed; it's memoryless. Oh right, the decay process has no memory, meaning the probability of decaying in the next interval is the same regardless of how much time has already passed.

So, the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay. But because the decay is memoryless, that doesn't affect the future probability. So the question now is, what's the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes from the current point.

Wait
