Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about reacting an epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, I remember that epoxides are strained rings, and when they react, especially with nucleophiles, there's some ring-opening involved. Let me think through this step by step.

The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means it has two rings, right? The numbering might help. The substituents are at 1, 3, 4, and 6 positions. The oxygen is at position 7, so that's the oxabicyclo part—so the epoxide is part of the structure.

So the molecule is a bicyclic epoxide. When it reacts with Me2CuLi, which is an organocuprate, a strong nucleophile. Organocuprates are known to add to carbonyl groups in a conjugate addition, but wait, in epoxide reactions, I think they act as nucleophiles opening the epoxide ring.

Epoxide ring-opening typically involves the nucleophile attacking one of the carbons in the epoxide. The regiochemistry depends on the structure—more substituted carbons are less likely to be attacked because they're more hindered. But wait, the question says that when saturated epoxides are reacted
