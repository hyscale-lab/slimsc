Alright, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Okay, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. When heated with excess KOH, I think this is an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so probably an E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromines, maybe it forms an allene or something else.

Wait, the product after KOH treatment is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR spectrum has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. Hmm, that IR peak is around the carbonyl region. So maybe a ketone was formed. Wait, but when dihalides react with strong bases, sometimes you get elimination to form alkenes or other unsaturated compounds. Alternatively, if both bromides are eliminated, perhaps forming a diene or something else. 

Wait, if KOH is in excess and heated, maybe we're looking at dehydrohalogenation. For 1,3-dibromoadamantane, eliminating two HBr molecules would form an allene (cumulative diene) or maybe a diene. But the IR at
