Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with cyanide, what usually happens? Oh, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So NaCN would act as the nucleophile. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are good nucleophiles.

In the product, we have a hydroxy group and a nitrile. So maybe it's an addition reaction where the CN- adds to the carbonyl. But wait, after addition, what happens? Let me think. In a typical ketone addition, you get a secondary alcohol. But here, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Oh! Maybe it's an addition followed by some kind of elimination or perhaps a different process.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is between the ketone and a cyanide in an acid-catalyzed addition. Oh right, sometimes the carbonyl is protonated first. So H3O+ (which is option A or B) as a reagent A would help in protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. That would form a geminal diol, like (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, no, because in a ketone addition, you get a secondary alcohol. So maybe the product after addition is a cyanohydrin.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's structure that. The nitrile is on carbon 2, which is attached to two CH3 groups and an OH. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So yeah, that's a cyanohydrin formation. So the reagent A would need to be an acid, like H3O+ or H2SO4 or something. So looking at options, A is H3O+ in option A and B, so that's possible.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to form a hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). Oh, right! That's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But wait, what conditions are needed for that?

Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires strong acid and heat, or sometimes a base. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think: the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, with something like HCl and water, with heat, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions (like with NaOH), it might go to an amide or carboxylate, which can then be acidified.

In this case, the reagent B is H2O, but what's the catalyst or acid/base? The options are either HCl or CH3COOH as B.

Wait, looking back at the reaction: the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, but after reaction with B (H2O), it becomes a butanoic acid. So, the CN becomes COOH. So I think this is a hydrolysis reaction, likely under acidic conditions. So if reagent B is HCl, which is a strong acid, that would make sense. Alternatively, if it's CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, would that work?

Wait, for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, I think you need a strong acid catalyst. So HCl (B in option A) would be the right choice. So in the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.

So looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. That would fit both reactions. Let's check.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ would lead to the formation of the cyanohydrin. Yes, because H3O+ is a strong acid, protonates the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. CN- attacks, forms the addition product.

Second reaction: the nitrile in the molecule undergoes hydrolysis with HCl and water. So yes, HCl as B would acidify the solution, facilitating the hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but another thought: wait, the second reagent is H2O, and B is the reagent. So the setup is the nitrile is treated with H2O (probably with an acid catalyst, like HCl). So that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl. So that fits.

Looking at other options: option C has A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3- which is a weaker acid. Wait, but in a reaction with ketones, maybe it's involved in another type of addition? Like maybe the formation of a bisulfite addition product. But I'm not sure. But in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which requires H+ from an acid catalyst for the protonation of the carbonyl.
