Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I think I can figure this out by taking it step by step.

So the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. That probably means we can use the classical velocity addition formula, right? Because if they're inertial, maybe things are simpler. Wait, no—wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no, because 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh, wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So relativistic effects might come into play here. Hmm, but the problem is about the distance traveled in the galaxy frame. So perhaps I need to calculate the proper time or something like that.

Wait, no. The question is about what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we have time in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about frames of reference. If in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, then from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at that same speed. Because in classical mechanics, velocities just add, but in relativity, it's more complicated. But since both are inertial frames, maybe I can use the Lorentz transformation here.

Wait, no, wait. If the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy, then in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy would be moving at -v. But wait, in this problem, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So that would imply that in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. So the two frames are moving relative to each other at v = 60,000 km/s.

Now, the problem states that 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So the time experienced in the ejecta is t' = 50 s. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during that time. But wait, in the galaxy's frame, how much time has passed when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the question is a bit tricky. It says, "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" So in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed, and during that time, how much distance has the ejecta covered in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, but wait. If the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v in the galaxy's frame, then the time in the galaxy's frame would be t, and the distance would be v * t. But in this case, the 50 seconds is in the ejecta's frame, so how do we relate that to the galaxy's frame?

Ah, I think I should use time dilation. Because time intervals can differ between frames. So in the galaxy's frame, the time is longer than in the ejecta's frame if the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, but wait again. The time experienced in the moving frame (ejecta) would be shorter than the time in the stationary frame (galaxy) if the motion is at a significant fraction of c. So for example, if in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it, then the time in the galaxy's frame would be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the relation between the two time measurements. The problem is about the distance in the galaxy's frame, so I need to find how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame when the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds.

But wait, no. The question says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So the ejecta's proper time is 50 seconds. So the time in the galaxy's frame would be longer because the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the galaxy.

So time dilation applies. The formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute gamma.

v is 60,000 km/s. Let me compute v in terms of c. c is 300,000 km/s, so v = 0.2c.

So v = 0.2c. Then, v²/c² = 0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

Then sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

Gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So in the galaxy's frame, about 51.03 seconds have passed.

Now, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * t. Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the center.

v is 60,000 km/s.

So distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.03 = Let's compute that.

60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800.

So total is 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 * (50 + 1.03) = 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 + 60,000 *1.03 = 61,800.

So 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, that's 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's close, but not exact. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the gamma calculation. Maybe I approximated gamma as 1.0206, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

v = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04.

So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10. sqrt(96) is approximately 9.798, so sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798.

So gamma is 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.0206, as I had before.

So 50 * 1.0206 ≈51.03.

Hmm, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 1 / sqrt(0.96) more precisely.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96):

0.96 = 96/100 = 24^2 * 0.01 * (1/ (24^2? Wait, no, 24^2 is 576. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute sqrt(0.96):

We can compute it as 0.96 = (0.98)^2 = 0.9604, which is slightly higher than 0.96.

So 0.98 is 0.9604, which is about 0.0004 above 0.96. So let's find a better approximation.

Alternatively, use a Taylor series expansion for sqrt(x) around x=1.

We can write sqrt(1 - ε) ≈ 1 - ε/2 - ε^2/8.

Here, ε=0.04.

So sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1 - 0.04/2 - (0.04)^2 /8.

Compute each term:

0.04/2 = 0.02.

(0.04)^2 = 0.0016; 0.0016 /8 = 0.0002.

So sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 - 0.02 - 0.0002 = 0.9798.

Which matches our earlier approximation.

So gamma is 1/0.9798 ≈1.02062.

So 50 * 1.02062 = 51.031 seconds.

So the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s.

Compute 60,000 * 51.031:

60,000 * 50 =3,000,000.

60,000 *1.031 = 61,860.

So total is 3,061,860 km.

But the options don't have exactly that. Let's look:

Option D is 3,060,000 km, which is 3.06 million km. That's 60,000 km/s * 51 = 3,060,000.

Wait, so perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the time dilation and just calculate v * t', which would be 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. But that’s option B.

Wait, that option is there, but I'm pretty sure that time dilation is necessary here because the speed is significant. Because the problem says that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So if the ejecta's own time is 50 seconds, the galaxy's time would be longer.

But another approach: perhaps the problem is using the classical approach, ignoring relativity. Because sometimes, for speeds much less than c, you can ignore relativistic effects. But 60,000 km/s is 20% of c, which is significant. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but the problem says that the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity is 60,000 km/s. So the distance it travels in t seconds (galaxy's frame) is 60,000 * t.

But here, we don't know t in the galaxy's frame. So we have to find t when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds.

So t = gamma * t' = (1.0206) *50 ≈51.03 s.

So distance is 60,000 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km. But none of the options match exactly.

Wait the options are:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D)3,060,000 km.

So option D is 3,060,000, which is close to our calculation of 3,061,800. But perhaps the exact calculation would give a value closer to 3,060,000.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.

v = 0.2c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062.

So t = 50 *1.02062 =51.031 s.

So more accurately, 51.031 s.

60,000 *51.031 = ?

60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 *0.031= 1,860.

So total is 3,061,860 km.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended approach is to ignore time dilation, which would give 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the problem is intended to use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the velocity in the galaxy's frame, but that doesn't make sense because we already have the velocity in that frame.

Wait, but the problem says that both are inertial frames. So perhaps the question is simply asking for v * t, but t is the time in the galaxy's frame, which is longer than the ejecta's frame.

If the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, then the distance would be larger than 3,000,000, which would match option D.

But why is option D 3,060,000? Because maybe the calculation was done exactly.

Wait, 60,000 km/s *51.031 s is 60,000*51.031 = 3,061,860 km.

Wait, but option D is 3,060,000 km, which is 60,000 *51.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects you to compute the distance in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction. Hmm, that's possible.

Wait, no, the problem is about the distance in the galaxy's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, and the time is longer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting you to use the velocity in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But in that frame, how long does it take for the galaxy to move a certain distance? But the question is about the distance the ejecta has moved in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the frames. Let's clarify:

In the galaxy's frame:

- The ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s.

In the ejecta's frame:

- The galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s.

The question is, when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how far has the ejecta moved in the galaxy's frame.

So in the galaxy's frame, the time is longer. So the distance is v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

t = gamma * t' = (1/(sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2))) * 50.

Wait, 0.2^2 is 0.04, so 1 -0.04=0.96, sqrt(0.96)= approx 0.9798. So gamma is approx 1.0206.

So t=50 *1.0206=51.03 s.

So distance =60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that gamma is approximately 1. So t in the galaxy's frame is about 50 seconds. Then distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.

But that would be ignoring the time dilation effect. That's probably not correct, but maybe the problem expects that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering velocity addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame. So the distance in the galaxy's frame would be v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

But since the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds, and because of time dilation, t = gamma * t'.

So using exact calculation, gamma is 1.0206, t is 51.03 s, and distance is 60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. Let me compute 60,000 *51=3,060,000. So perhaps the problem expects you to approximate gamma as 1.02, which would give t=50*1.02=51 s, leading to 3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to treat it as a Galilean transformation, so no time dilation, t is 50s, and distance 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would ignore relativity, which may not be correct given the high speed.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation; it doesn't say to ignore relativity. So it's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the ejecta's velocity in the galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. So the distance is simply v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

But t is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So how do we find t in the galaxy's frame?

Hmm, using the time dilation formula, t = gamma * t'.

So t = 50 * (1/ sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2)).

Again, gamma is 1.0206, so t ≈51.03 s.

So the distance is 60,000 *51.03≈3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, 3,000,000 km, ignoring relativity.

Wait, but the problem states that both are inertial frames, which suggests that relativity is in play. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the frames reversed. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. So the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach: using the Lorentz transformation to find the distance.

In the ejecta's frame, the time is t' =50 s. The position of the ejecta in its own frame is x'=0, and the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So perhaps the position of the galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame is x' = -v * t' = -60,000 *50 = -3,000,000 km. Wait, but that's in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but we need to find the distance the ejecta has moved in the galaxy's frame. So perhaps we can use the Lorentz transformation to find x in the galaxy's frame.

The Lorentz transformation equations are:

x = gamma (x' + v t')

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

But in the ejecta's frame, the ejecta is at rest, so x' =0, and the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v. Wait, perhaps I should frame this correctly.

Wait, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the galaxy. So the galaxy's frame is S, and the ejecta's frame is S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S.

Wait, in S' (ejecta's frame), the galaxy is moving at -v (since in S, the ejecta is moving at +v). So the time in S' is t', and the position in S' is x'.

We need to find the position of the ejecta in S (galaxy's frame) when t' =50 s.

Wait, but the ejecta is at rest in S', so in S', x' =0, and the galaxy is approaching at velocity v.

Wait, but the problem is about how far the ejecta has moved in S when 50 seconds have passed in S'.

Hmm. So in S', the ejecta is at x'=0, and the galaxy's center is moving towards it at velocity v (from the perspective of S', the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s). So from S', after 50 seconds, the galaxy has moved 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km closer.

But in S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v. So in S, the distance the ejecta travels is v * t, where t is the time in S.

But using the Lorentz transformation, since in S' the time is t'=50 s, what is t in S?

Alternatively, perhaps using the velocity transformation. But maybe it's easier to compute the position of the ejecta in S when t' =50.

Wait, let me use the Lorentz transformation.

In S', the position of the ejecta is x' =0, and the time is t' =50 s.

We can find the corresponding x and t in S.

Using the Lorentz equations:

x = gamma (x' + v t') 

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

Since x' =0, this simplifies to:

x = gamma * v * t'

t = gamma * t'

So substituting the values:

gamma = 1.0206, v=60,000 km/s, t'=50 s.

So x = 1.0206 *60,000 *50.

Compute that: 60,000 *50 =3,000,000.

1.0206 *3,000,000 =3,061,800 km.

Again, same as before.

So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta has moved 3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have this number. So perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km, which is close to our calculated value.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects you to round gamma as 1.02, leading to t=50 *1.02=51 s, and thus 60,000 *51=3,060,000 km, which is option D.

So I think the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relating Time in the Two Frames**:  
   Since the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, time dilation applies. The relationship between the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) and the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is given by:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( v = 0.2c \), we calculate:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   t = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Calculating the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta travels at a constant speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). The distance traveled is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \cdot 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Matching with the Options**:  
   The calculated distance (\( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \)) is very close to option \( D \) (\( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \)). The slight discrepancy arises from rounding \( \gamma \) to \( 1.02 \), which simplifies the calculation to \( t = 51 \, \text{s} \), leading to:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \cdot 51 \, \text{s} = 3,060,000 \, \text{km}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer, accounting for relativistic effects and approximations, is \( D \).

**Answer: D**
