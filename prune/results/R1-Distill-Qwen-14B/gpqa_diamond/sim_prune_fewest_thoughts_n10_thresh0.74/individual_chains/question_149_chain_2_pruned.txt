Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized peptidic compound. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly like what's expected except for two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. They have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, the integration suggests that each peak is about half a proton, right? But the question says to rule out spin-spin coupling. Wait, why can't it be coupling? Oh, because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. So maybe it's not something like a doublet of doublets or anything like that.

Then, looking at the LC-MS. They ran it at elevated temperature and saw two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So, same mass, same everything, but two different peaks on the chromatogram. That suggests there are two different compounds with the same mass. But wait, same mass would mean same molecular formula, right? So maybe they're isomers or something.

Wait, what causes two peaks with same mass? Enantiomers would have same mass, but same retention time on a normal column because they're mirror images. Unless it's a chiral column, but the question says it's a standard LC-MS, maybe. But the peaks have same intensity, so it's not like one is present more than the other. So, maybe it's a diastereomer situation because diastereomers can have different retention times on a regular column.

But wait, the NMR showed the same alpha-proton with two peaks. In NMR, diastereomers would have different coupling because the environment is different. But if the coupling is similar, maybe it's not diastereomers? Or perhaps the coupling is not due to that.

Alternatively, if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for each proton because in a racemic mixture, the two enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. So the NMR wouldn't show two peaks. Wait, but the question says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton, but NMR would average them in a racemic mixture. So maybe that's not it.

What about if it's a mixture of diastereomers?
