Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and they're trying to study their developmental fate. The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which I remember means it has two genes under a single promoter but separated by an IRES element. So each gene can be independently expressed.

The vector's structure is: ligand ORF at 5' with mCherry fusion, followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then the IRES, receptor ORF, and eGFP fusion with another stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272). The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the proteins on a Western blot. So they're checking if the proteins are expressed. Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed them with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is likely to be active in neural crest cells.

The problem is that after the offspring are born, they don't see a green signal under the confocal. The green is from eGFP, which is on the receptor construct. So why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Let me think about how the vector works. The loxP and lox2272 sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. The stop cassettes would block expression unless Cre is expressed to remove them.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the first gene (ligand) is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. Then, the receiver gene (receptor) is after the IRES. So, the ligand and receptor are both expressed from the same promoter but each under the control of their own regulatory elements.

But in the vector, the ligand has a stop cassette after it (so after the ligand ORF, the mRNA has a stop codon unless loxP sites are used). Similarly, the receptor has a stop cassette after it.

Wait, no. Let me get the structure right. The vector is ligand-ORF (with mCherry fusion) followed by stop in loxP-stop-loxP. Then IRES, then receptor ORF (with eGFP C-terminus), and stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272.

Hmm. So perhaps when Cre is active, it will excise the stop cassettes. The CBA promoter drives the ligand ORF, but the IRES is before the receptor. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate mRNA after the ligand.

Wait, but the bicistronic vector is set up so that the ligand and receptor are co-expressed, right? Because the vector is designed to allow both to be expressed from a single transcript, but each under their own control. So, when the Cre is
