Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The compound given is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-bromobenzene-1-d? Or wait, maybe it's a typo. Oh wait, no, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so each position is numbered 1 through 6. So 1-bromobenzene would have a bromine on the first carbon. Then, the 2-d part—maybe that's a deuterium? Oh right, sometimes in questions, deuterium is written as d, like in deuterated compounds. So perhaps 1-bromobenzene-2-d is a benzene ring with a bromine on carbon 1 and a deuterium on carbon 2. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so replacing H with D on adjacent positions might have some implications.

The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. In condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent, but more importantly, NaNH2 is a strong base used in dehydrohalogenation, elimination reactions, or for the formation of aromatic rings via elimination.

So, the reaction here is probably a dehydrohalogenation—eliminating H
