Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically the area of the event horizon. The formula, I think, is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. But wait, maybe I should double-check that formula.

The question gives the angular size θ of the event horizon as 10^-17 degrees. The galaxy is at a distance d of 10^10 parsecs. So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, right? Because the area depends on the radius.

Wait, the angular size θ is probably the angular diameter. So the formula for angular diameter is θ (in radians) ≈ 2r/d. Oh wait, actually, the formula is θ ≈ 2r/d when the distance d is much larger than r, which is usually the case for distant galaxies. So I can approximate θ ≈ 2r/d. I should convert θ from degrees to radians because the formula uses radians. 

Let me think about the units conversion. Since θ is 1e-17 degrees, to radians, that's 1e-17 * (π/180). So approximately θ ≈ (1e-17 * π) / 180 radians.

So, solving for r: r ≈ (θ * d) / 2. But wait, d is given in parsecs, and I need to convert that into meters because the formula uses SI units. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

Putting that together: θ ≈ (1e-17 degrees) converted to radians. Let me compute that. 1e-17 degrees is (1e-17 * π) / 180. Let's approximate π as 3.1416, so that's roughly (1e-17 * 3.1416) / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, no, wait. Wait 1 degree is π/180 ≈ 0.01745 radians. So 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Okay.

So θ ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So r ≈ (θ * d) / 2. Let's plug in the numbers. θ is ~1.745e-19 rad, d is 3.086e26 m. So r ≈ (1.745e-19 * 3.086e26) / 2.
