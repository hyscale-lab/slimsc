Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see... The question is about reactions involving mCPBA and the products formed, then looking at the HPLC results. Hmm.

Alright, so first, let me think about what mCPBA does. I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, right? And peracids are typically used in epoxidation reactions. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes they can also cause other reactions like epoxide formation, maybe some dihydroxylation... Wait, no, dihydroxylation is usually with something like OsO4 or another oxidizing agent. Oh right, mCPBA is mainly for epoxidizing alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide.

But wait, the reaction conditions here are followed by aqueous acid. Oh, right, sometimes after epoxidation, you can do an acid work-up. So what happens when an epoxide is treated with acid? I think the epoxide ring opens. Epoxides under acidic conditions typically undergo ring-opening. How does that go again? The acid protonates the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then the ring opens, and the nucleophile (like water, if in aqueous acid) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stable. Wait, or is it the less substituted? Hmm, I think in acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized when the ring opens. Because the more substituted carbon has more alkyl groups to stabilize the transition state or the carbocation.

So, for each reaction, the starting material is a diene. Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene. Reaction 2 is (Z)-oct-4-ene. Let me draw the structures. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on both sides of the double bond. Wait, no, wait. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on both ends. Let me think: octene is 8 carbons. 4-ene is between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Let me number it properly. Carbon 1 to 8. Double bond between 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. No, wait that's not right. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, 4-ene would be between C4 and C5 in an 8-carbon chain. So the structure would be: CH2CH
