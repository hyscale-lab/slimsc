Okay, so I've got a quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1 since p orbitals are l=1. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1.

The problem gives a coupled angular momentum state: |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, because when you couple two angular momenta, the total l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. So l1 is 1, l2 is 1. So possible total l are 0, 1, 2.

Hmm, but the given state is |1,1,2,-1>. Oh wait, that makes sense because 2 is the maximum (1+1=2).

Now, the question asks about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We need to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z are measured to be -ħ.

Wait, orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are l, and the eigenvalues for Lz are m * ħ. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction can be m = -l, ..., +l.

But wait, the coupled state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So the total angular momentum quantum number is L=2, and M is -1.

In this state, what are the possible values of m1 and m2 (the individual m quantum numbers) of the two electrons?

Because the total M is m1 + m2. So M = m1 + m2.

In the given state, M is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But each m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a combination of all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of L² and Lz, so it's a combination of all possible |l1,m1> |l2,m2> with m1 + m2 = M = -1.

So the possible pairs (m1, m2) are:

- (-1, 0), because -1 +0 =-1

- (0, -1), because 0 + (-1) = -1.

Wait, but wait, when l1 and l2 are both 1, the possible m1 and m2 are -1, 0, +1 each.

So the total M is m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible combinations are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1.

Wait, are there any other possibilities? Let me see:

m1=1, m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can only be -1,0,1.

So no, those are the only two possibilities.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, I think in coupling angular momenta, the states are constructed as |l1 m1> |l2 m2> when m1 + m2 = M.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a combination of the two basis states where m1 + m2 = -1.

Now, the problem is about the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ each. So that would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L1z eigenvalue is m1 * ħ, so to get -ħ, m1 must be -1, same for m2.

Wait, but in the given coupled state, M = m1 + m2 = -1. So if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2. But the total M is -1, so that's impossible. So the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> isn't part of the |1,1,2,-1> state.

Because in the given state, the sum of m1 and m2 is -1, so if both are -1, that's a sum of -2, which doesn't match M=-1.

So in the given state, the possible m1 and m2 are either (-1,0) or (0,-1).

So when we measure L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes are either:

m1=-1, m2=0 → L1z = -ħ, L2z = 0.

Or m1=0, m2=-1 → L1z=0, L2z=-ħ.

In either case, only one of the Lz components is -ħ, the other is 0.

So the joint probability of both being -ħ is zero because the state doesn't allow both m1 and m2 to be -1. Therefore, the probability is zero.

Wait, but wait, is the given state an eigenstate of the individual L1z and L2z? Or is it a combination of states where each m1 and m2 can vary, but their sum is -1.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of L² and Lz, but not of L1z and L2z. So when you measure L1z and L2z, you'll collapse the state into a basis state where m1 and m2 are definite. But in this coupled state, the possible outcomes are the combinations where m1 + m2 =-1. So the possible outcomes for (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1), each with some probability.

So the joint probability of m1=-1 AND m2=-1 is zero because there's no component in the state where both are -1.

Therefore, the probability is zero. So looking at the options:

A) 2/3 → no.

B) 1 → no.

C) 1/2 → no.

D) 0 → yes.

So the correct answer is D.


The problem involves two electrons in a p orbital, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l_1 = 1 \), \( l_2 = 1 \), \( l = 2 \), and \( m = -1 \). The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \).

In quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of \( L_{z} \) are given by \( m \hbar \), where \( m \) is the magnetic quantum number. For the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), the total angular momentum quantum number \( M = m_1 + m_2 = -1 \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the magnetic quantum numbers of the two electrons. The possible combinations of \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \) are:

1. \( m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0 \)
2. \( m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1 \)

These combinations correspond to the basis states \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle \) and \( |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle \). The coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is a linear combination of these basis states.

To have both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) equal to \( -\hbar \), the magnetic quantum numbers must satisfy \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). However, this combination does not satisfy the condition \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \), as it would yield \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \). Therefore, the state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) is not part of the \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) state.

Since the coupled state does not include the \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) component, the joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero.

**Critical analysis of the options:**

- **A) \( \frac{2}{3} \):** Incorrect, as the state does not include the \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) component.
- **B) \( 1 \):** Incorrect, as it is impossible for both \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) to be \( -1 \) in the given coupled state.
- **C) \( \frac{1}{2} \):** Incorrect, as there is no probability associated with the \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) component.
- **D) \( 0 \):** Correct, as the \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) component is absent in the coupled state.

Answer: D
