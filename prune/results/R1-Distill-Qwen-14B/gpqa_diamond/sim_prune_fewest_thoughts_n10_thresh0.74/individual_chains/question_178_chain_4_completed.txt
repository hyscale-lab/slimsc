Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The given Lagrangian is 𝒜_int = κψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that the gamma matrices γ are dimensionless, right? Because in QFT, the dimension of the fields and coupling constants are determined based on the spacetime dimension, usually 4D.

Wait, but what about the fields ψ? Fermions like ψ have a certain mass dimension. Let me recall: in 4 dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the action is dimensionless, and the Lagrangian density has dimensions of [Mass]^4 (since integrating over four spacetime dimensions gives action, which is dimensionless). So each term in the Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4.

Each term in the Lagrangian should be dimensionless when you include all the factors. So when I look at 𝒜_int, it's κ times ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's figure out the dimensions of each part.

ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2. Then σ_{μν} is made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so σ is dimensionless. Then ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimensions (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. 

Wait, wait. Oh no, σ_{μν} is a tensor made from the gamma matrices, so it's a product of two gamma matrices, but in the sense of a commutator. But since each gamma is dimensionless, σ is also dimensionless. So the ψ̄ σ ψ part would have dimensions 3/2 (from ψ̄) + 3/2 (from ψ) = 3 dimensions.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Wait, F is antisymmetric, and in the Lagrangian, it's the field tensor. The field strength F has dimensions of [Mass]^2 because the electromagnetic field tensor is derived from the potential A, which has dimension 1. Since F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, each derivative is dimension 1 (since ∂ is ∂/∂x, which is mass dimension 1), so F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions:

κ has some dimension, let's call it [κ]_M.

The rest: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then F is 2. So the whole term is [κ]_M + 3 + 2 = [κ]_M +5. 

But the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate over four dimensions, the action is dimensionless. So the term must have dimension 4. So:

[κ]_M +5 =4 → [κ]_M = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So that narrows down the options. Now, looking at the options:

Option A: dim κ is -1, theory renormalizable.

Option C: same dimension, not renormalizable.

So next, I need to figure out if the theory is renormalizable. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive mass dimension. Wait, wait, no. Because the mass dimension of the coupling constant determines the superficial degree of divergence of the Feynman diagrams. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, then the theory is not renormalizable because the interaction terms would have higher dimension, leading to divergences that can't be absorbed by the renormalization of the existing terms.

Wait, the general rule is that a renormalizable interaction term has coupling with mass dimension ≤ d, where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, no, more specifically, in 4D, the coupling dimension is [g] = 4 - (sum of fermion dimensions in the term). So for a term like ψ̄ ψ, that's 3/2 *2 =3. So the coupling would have [g] =4-3=1. In this case, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the sum of the fields is (3/2)*2 + 2 (since F is a field but how does it count? Wait, F is a field, but wait, in terms of the term, it's a product of four fields? No, wait, the Lagrangian is a product of ψ̄ σ ψ and F. Wait, no, ψ̄ σ ψ is a scalar (since σ is a tensor and the indices are contracted), so it's a scalar field part. Then F is another field, which has dimension 2 as I thought.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to find the mass dimension of each field in the term and sum them, then subtract from 4 (since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4). So the term is:

κ ψ̄ (σ ψ) F → but actually, σ is a product of gamma matrices, which are operators, not fields. Wait, no, σ is part of the term, but the fields are ψ̄, ψ, and F.

Wait, ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2. F has dimension 2.

So the term ψ̄ σ ψ F would have 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5.

So the Lagrangian term is κ times this, which is dimension [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

But for renormalizability, the interaction terms must have all couplings with [g] ≥0, I think. Because if [g]<0, then the interaction becomes relevant or superrenormalizable, but wait, no.

Wait, wait, in 4 dimensions, the dimension of the coupling determines whether the theory is renormalizable. For a term like φ^m, the coupling dimension is [g]_M = 4 - (d φ) * m. If [g] is positive, the theory is nonrenormalizable, because each vertex in Feynman diagrams contributes a factor of g, and higher dimension implies more factors of momentum in the numerator, leading to higher superficial degree of divergence.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = d L - (sum over external legs) (d_i), where d_i is the dimension of each field. But for the coupling constants, it's a bit different. Alternatively, the condition for renormalizability is that the interaction term must have a coupling with mass dimension ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has negative dimension, then you need to introduce an infinite number of higher-dimension terms to absorb the divergences, making the theory nonrenormalizable.

Wait another approach. The theory is renormalizable if all the interaction terms in the Lagrangian are of mass dimension ≤4. Wait, no, the interaction term L_int has dimension 4, because Lagrangian density has dimension 4 in 4D. So each term in L_int must be dimension 4. But wait, that's not correct because the Lagrangian can have multiple terms. Each term must be of mass dimension 4. So each term's dimensions must add up to 4.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F^{μν}.

The dimension of each part is:

ψ̄ and ψ each have 3/2. F has 2. So ψ̄ σ ψ F has 3/2 +3/2 +2= 3 +2=5. So κ must have dimension -1 to make the entire term dimension 4.

But wait, for the term to be allowed in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constant must have a non-negative mass dimension. Because if [κ]_M is negative, then the term is of higher dimension, and the interaction becomes nonrenormalizable. Wait, so [κ]=-1.

Negative mass dimension implies that the term is nonrenormalizable. Because in 4D, a coupling with negative mass dimension would require the term to have higher dimension than 4, which isn't allowed in renormalizable theories. So because [κ]=-1, which is less than 0, the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting this together, [κ]_M is -1, and the theory isn't renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory isn't renormalizable. Option A says it is renormalizable.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $\gamma_\mu$ are dimensionless gamma matrices. The fields $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ are Dirac spinors with mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$ because it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has dimension $1$, and $F^{\mu\nu} \sim \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has the following dimensions:
- $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ each have dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is dimensionless.

Thus, $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has total dimension:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3.
\]
The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension $2$. Therefore, the entire term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension:
\[
3 + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must have mass dimension:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Here, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has mass dimension $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension, and the theory requires an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While $[\kappa]_M = -1$, the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is not $1$.
- **Option C**: Correct. $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is not $1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
