Okay, so I'm looking at this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I remember that when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of hydrogen in deep space, the hydrogen absorbs certain wavelengths, specifically the Lyman alpha line. I think Lyman alpha is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range.

Wait, the question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So, I need to figure out when the wavelength of the absorbed light would shift into the optical range, which is what ground-based telescopes can see.

Oh right, redshift (z) determines how much the wavelength stretches. The formula I remember is observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit*(1+z). So the emitted Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers or 121.6 nm. But optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 nm to about 700 nm. So we want the observed wavelength to be just at the lower end of optical, maybe around 400 nm.

Wait, actually, ground-based optical telescopes can't see into the ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light. So the quasar's Lyman alpha emission would be redshifted into the optical range to be observable. So the cloud itself has to be at a redshift where the absorption line is in the optical.

Wait, no. Wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the quasar emits light, including the Lyman alpha emission line. But when this light passes through a hydrogen cloud that's moving away, that line is absorbed and redshifted. Wait, no, wait: if the cloud is at a certain redshift, the Lyman alpha line (emitted by the cloud) would be at a longer wavelength. But wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way. The quasar emits the Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. If the quasar is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+z). But if there's a hydrogen cloud between us and the quasar at a redshift z_cloud, then the cloud's own Lyman alpha (emitted at rest frame 1216) would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). And if that observed wavelength is in the optical range, then we can detect it.

Wait, but the question is about the cloud's redshift. So for the cloud's Lyman-alpha absorption to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) should be less than or equal to the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can observe. Wait, no, because if the cloud is at a higher redshift, the absorption line would be longer. Let me think again.

Wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the cloud. The cloud is at a certain redshift, so the Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud would appear at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the quasar's own emission line (if any) would be at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the question is about detecting the absorption line, which is from the cloud.

So for ground-based optical telescopes, which observe wavelengths up to around 1 micrometer (1000 nm), but typically visible light is up to about 700 nm. Wait, but I think some optical telescopes can go a bit into near-infrared, but maybe up to about 1 micron. So the maximum wavelength we can observe is around 1000 nm.

So to find the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud, we need the observed Lyman alpha to be at least in the optical range. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Let's convert to nanometers: 1216 A = 121.6 nm.

The observed wavelength is λ = 1216 * (1 + z). We want this to be in the optical, so let's say the lower end is around 400 nm (violet light). Wait, but to be detected, it needs to be in the range that optical telescopes can see. So let's set λ = 400 nm as the minimum for optical (since UV is absorbed by the atmosphere and not visible from the ground). Wait, but wait, 400 nm is violet, which is near the UV. So perhaps we can go a bit into the near-UV, but I think most optical telescopes can't observe beyond about 350 nm or so. Hmm, not sure. But maybe for this problem, the optical range is taken as 400 nm to about 700 nm.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the largest possible redshift where the absorption line is still in the optical. So when does 1216*(1 + z) equal the maximum wavelength that can be observed. Let's take that maximum as 700 nm (red end of visible light). Alternatively, the minimum would be 400 nm.

Wait, but the lower limit on redshift is the smallest z where the absorption line is just entering the optical. Wait, no, the question says the lower limit on the redshift so that they can be detected. So the minimal z where they are just detectable, meaning the absorption line is at the highest possible wavelength that can be observed.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The Lyman alpha is at 1216 A (121.6 nm). To move this into the optical, which is up to about 700 nm, the redshift z must be such that 1216*(1 + z) = 700 nm. Let's compute z.

Wait, 1216 A is 121.6 nm. So 121.6 nm * (1 + z) = 700 nm.

So (1 + z) = 700 / 121.6 ≈ 5.756.

So z ≈ 4.756. That's z ≈ 4.76.

But looking at the options, the highest option is C) 2.4 and D)1.9. Wait, that's way higher. Did I do something wrong.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I have the scenario wrong. Let me reevaluate. The quasar is at a high redshift, and the hydrogen cloud is between us and the quasar. So the quasar's light is redshifted, but the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is also redshifted by z_cloud. Wait, but the cloud's redshift is less than the quasar's. So the quasar's emission line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The cloud's absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So if z_quasar is higher than z_cloud, then the absorption line is at a shorter wavelength than the emission line.

Wait, but the question is about detecting the absorption line. So the absorption line will be at 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). If the quasar is at z_quasar, then the quasar's light is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud), which is less than the quasar's emission line if z_cloud < z_quasar.

Wait, but the question says the cloud absorbs the quasar's light. So the quasar's light is coming through, but the absorption is at a certain wavelength. So for that absorption to be in the optical, the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is less than or equal to the maximum wavelength that the optical telescope can see.

But wait, the maximum wavelength that can be observed is about 1000 nm (1 micron), but optical is up to about 700 nm. So the maximum possible z_cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 700 nm.

Wait, let me compute that.

1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm.

Set 121.6 * (1 + z) = 700 nm.

So 1 + z = 700 / 121.6 ≈ 5.756 → z ≈ 4.756.

But none of the options are that high. The highest option is C) 2.4. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, wait. Maybe I'm mixing up the emitted and observed wavelengths. Let me think again. The quasar emits light, and the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 A. If the quasar is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). But the cloud is at redshift z_cloud. The cloud's own Lyman alpha line is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). The quasar's light is passing through the cloud, so the cloud absorbs the quasar's light at the cloud's rest frame wavelength. So the quasar's light, which is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar), will have the cloud absorb it at 1216*(1 + z_cloud).

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the quasar's emitted wavelength and the cloud's absorption. The quasar emits the Lyman alpha at 1216 A. The cloud, which is at redshift z_cloud, is moving away, so the wavelength observed from the cloud's absorption is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for that absorption to be observed in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be less than or equal to the maximum optical wavelength. Let's say that maximum is 700 nm (visible red).

So 1216 A = 121.6 nm. So 121.6 * (1 + z_cloud) = 700 nm.

1 + z_cloud = 700 / 121.6 ≈ 5.756 → z_cloud ≈ 4.756.

But the options don't go that high. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait another thought: perhaps the quasar's light we receive is in the optical. So the quasar must be at a redshift where its emitted optical light is observed in optical. For example, the quasar emits in the UV, but if it's at a high redshift, its UV emission is shifted into the optical. So the quasar's redshift must be such that, say, its rest-frame optical emission is observed in optical. But that might not directly affect the cloud's redshift.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 A. If the quasar is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). But if the cloud is in front of the quasar, then the cloud will absorb at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). For us to see that absorption line in the optical, that wavelength must be less than about 700 nm.

So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤ 700 nm → 1 + z_cloud ≤ 700/121.6 ≈ 5.756 → z_cloud ≤ 4.756.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z_cloud where 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is just in the optical.

Wait, but the options are much lower. The highest option is 2.4. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption about the maximum wavelength.

Wait, perhaps the maximum wavelength of the optical is longer. Maybe up to 1000 nm (1 micron), which is near-infrared, but some optical telescopes can go a bit into near-IR. So let me use 1000 nm as the maximum.

So 121.6*(1 + z_cloud) = 1000 nm → 1 + z_cloud = 8.225 → z_cloud ≈7.225. Still way higher than options.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, perhaps instead of the cloud's Lyman alpha being in the optical, maybe the quasar's Lyman alpha is in the optical, and the cloud's absorption is at a higher redshift, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the cloud's redshift is such that the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is observed in the optical, which would require the quasar to be at a redshift where 1216*(1 + z_quasar) is in the optical.

Wait, but the question is about the cloud, not the quasar. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is in the observed frame. So the quasar's light, which includes the Lyman alpha emission, is being absorbed by the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is such that when it absorbs the quasar's Lyman alpha, the absorption line is in the optical.

Wait, the quasar's Lyman alpha is at 1216 A. If the quasar is at redshift z_quasar, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The cloud, which is between us and the quasar, is at redshift z_cloud < z_quasar. The cloud's own Lyman alpha is at 1216 A in its rest frame, but when observed, it's at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So the cloud absorbs the quasar's light at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the observed frame.

We want that absorption line to be in the optical. So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤ max_optical_wavelength.

Assuming max_optical is about 700 nm, 121.6*(1 + z_cloud) = 700 → 1 + z_cloud = 700/121.6 ≈5.756 → z_cloud≈4.756.

But again, the options don't go that high. So perhaps the maximum wavelength is higher, like 1000 nm (1 micron), which is near-infrared but sometimes considered part of optical. Let's try that.

121.6*(1 + z_cloud) = 1000 → 1 + z_cloud = 1000/121.6 ≈8.225 → z_cloud≈7.225. Still way beyond any options.

Hmm, so maybe I have the formula wrong. Wait, could it be that the quasar's light is beyond the optical, so the cloud's absorption line is in the optical, but the quasar's emission is in the infrared? No, because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the quasar's light is more redshifted than the cloud's.

Wait, wait. Maybe the cloud's Lyman alpha is in the optical, but the quasar's emission is in the infrared. So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. But the quasar's redshift would be much higher than the cloud's.

Wait, but the question is about the cloud's redshift. So regardless, I'm stuck because my calculation suggests a z_cloud of about 4.75, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the maximum wavelength.

Wait, another thought: maybe the quasar's Lyman alpha is at 1216 A, and the cloud's redshift z_cloud causes the absorption line to be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But if the quasar is at a higher redshift, say z_quasar, then the quasar's light is observed in the infrared. So for the cloud's absorption to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be less than or equal to the maximum optical wavelength. Let's say the maximum is 700 nm, so 121.6*(1 + z_cloud) =700 nm.

Wait, that's the same as before. So perhaps the question is actually about the quasar's redshift, but the wording says the cloud's.

Wait, but the question says: "lower limit on the redshift of this objects" — which objects? The clouds or the quasars? The question states "large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars." So the clouds are in front of the quasars, so their redshifts are lower than the quasars. So the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's.

But the question is about the cloud's redshift. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem has an error. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the rest wavelengths. Let me check the units again.

Wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1 + z) =7000 → 1 + z =7000/1216 ≈5.756 → z=4.756.

But the options are much lower. So perhaps the maximum wavelength considered is 5000 Angstroms (500 nm), which is green. Let's compute that.

1216*(1 + z) =5000 → 1 +z=5000/1216≈4.098 → z≈3.098.

So z≈3.1. Looking at the options, option A is 3. So that's close. So perhaps the maximum wavelength is considered 5000 A (500 nm). But why would they choose that? I thought optical goes up to about 700 nm.

Wait, maybe the question is about the Lyman limit. Wait, no, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think if I can find another approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the quasar's light is observed in the optical, so the quasar must have a redshift where its emitted optical light is observed in optical. For example, the quasar emits rest-frame optical at 500 nm. Observed at 500 nm would mean z=0, but that's not possible because quasars are high-z. So perhaps the quasar's rest-frame UV is observed in optical. So the quasar's Lyman alpha is 1216 A. So for that to be observed in optical, say 500 nm: 1216*(1+z) =5000 A. Which is as before, z≈3.098. So about 3.1.

Looking at the options, option A is 3. So perhaps that's the intended answer. But I'm not entirely confident because I thought optical goes up to 700 nm. But maybe in this context, the maximum is considered 500 nm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about when the cloud's Lyman-alpha absorption line is in the optical.

Wait, but earlier I thought the cloud's Lyman-alpha would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So if z_cloud is 3, then 1216*(4)= 4864 A (486 nm), which is blue-green. That's within the optical range. So the lower limit on the redshift would be when the cloud's Lyman-alpha is just entering optical, perhaps at 400 nm (violet). Let's compute that.

1216*(1 +z)=4000 A → 1 + z =4000/1216≈3.29 → z≈2.29.

So that would be around 2.3. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Wait, but earlier when I took 500 nm (5000 A), the z was about 3.098, leading to option A being 3.

But the question is about a lower limit. So the minimal z where the absorption is in optical. So if the absorption is at 400 nm (the lower end of optical), then z is about 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.3, which is option C (2.4).

Wait, but why wouldn't it be higher, considering that the absorption must be in optical? Because if the cloud's z is lower than 2.3, the absorption line would be at 1216*(1 + z) <4000 A (400 nm), which is in UV, and not observable from the ground. So the lower limit is when the absorption line is at 400 nm, requiring z_cloud ≈2.29, which is about option C.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation:

λ =4000 A → 4000 =1216*(1 +z) → 1 +z=4000/1216≈3.29 → z=2.29.

So option C is 2.4, which is close. So the lower limit would be around 2.3, meaning any cloud with z >=2.3 would have their Lyman-alpha in the optical. So the lower limit is z=2.3, so option C (2.4) is the answer.

But wait looking at the options, option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.3. So if the cloud is at z=1.9, 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526.4 A (352.6 nm), which is violet, but still in the optical range? Wait, no, 352.6 nm is near UV. Wait, but the atmosphere doesn't let that through. So ground-based telescopes can't see below about 300 nm or so. So a cloud at z=1.9 would have Lyman-alpha at 352.6 nm, which is in the near-UV, not observable from the ground.

So the actual lower limit is when the Lyman-alpha is around 300 nm (so z_cloud ≈ (300/121.6) -1 ≈ (2.469) -1=1.469. So about 1.47.

Wait, but then the options include B)1.2 and D)1.9.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the maximum observable wavelength is lower than I thought. Let me think.

If the maximum wavelength that can be observed is, say, 360 nm (which is near UV but sometimes considered in some optical observations), then 1216*(1 +z) =3600 A → 1 + z =3600/1216≈2.96 → z≈1.96. That's around 1.96, which is very close to option D (1.9).

So perhaps the maximum wavelength is 3600 A (360 nm), making the lower limit z≈1.96. So the lower limit is about 2, so option D)1.9 is the closest.

But why 360 nm? I thought optical goes up to about 700 nm. Maybe the question considers that the Lyman-alpha absorption can only be detected if it's in the visible part of the spectrum, so above 400 nm.

Wait, but 360 nm is in the near-UV, which is blocked by the atmosphere. So perhaps the maximum wavelength is 400 nm.

If that's the case, then z_cloud ≈ (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.29-1=2.29. So the lower limit is about 2.3, which is option C (2.4).

But earlier when I assumed that the maximum is 3600 A (360 nm), the z was about 1.96, which is option D.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z where the cloud's Lyman-alpha is observed in optical. So if optical goes down to 400 nm, then z=2.29. If optical goes down to 360 nm (though usually not observable from ground), then z=1.96.

But since the question specifies 'ground-based telescopes', which can't observe below about 300 nm, I think the maximum wavelength is around 360 nm or higher. So perhaps the calculation is made using 400 nm as the lower end of optical.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: The quasar's light is observed in the optical, which implies that the quasar's redshift must be such that its emission is in the optical. But the cloud's absorption line must also be in the optical.

Wait, let me think. The quasar emits light, including the Lyman alpha line at 1216 A. The cloud, at redshift z_cloud, absorbs that light at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). The quasar itself is at a higher redshift, z_quasar, so the quasar's light is observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But we're only concerned with the cloud's absorption line being in the optical.

So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). For this to be in the optical, let's say up to 700 nm (7000 A), but that gives a z_cloud of about 4.75, which isn't among the options.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the quasar's and cloud's redshifts. Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that the cloud's Lyman-alpha absorption is at wavelength λ_obs. For ground-based optical, λ_obs must be ≥400 nm (violet) up to 700 nm (red). So:

400 nm ≤ 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤700 nm.

But 1216 is 121.6 nm. So 121.6*(1+z_cloud) must be between 400 and 700 nm.

So 400 ≤121.6*(1 + z_cloud) ≤700.

Divide all parts by 121.6:

400/121.6 ≈3.29 ≤1 +z_cloud ≤700/121.6≈5.756.

So 3.29 -1=2.29 ≤z_cloud ≤4.756.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit is about 2.3. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4.

So the correct answer would be option C) 2.4.

But wait, the options include B)1.2 and D)1.9. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the quasar's own Lyman-alpha is at 1216 A, but the cloud's absorption is at a higher wavelength. So perhaps the cloud's redshift is higher than the quasar's, which doesn't make sense because the cloud is in front.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the quasar's redshift being such that the cloud's absorption is in the optical. Wait, the question is about the cloud's redshift.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that for the absorption line to be in the optical, the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is ≤700 nm (7000 A) → z_cloud ≤ (7000/1216)-1≈4.75. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z_cloud where the absorption is in the optical.

But if the cloud's redshift is minimal, then the absorption line is at the maximum wavelength in the optical. That would be z_cloud ≈4.75. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question is asking the minimal z where the absorption line is in the optical, which is when the absorption line is just entering the optical.

Wait, no. If the cloud's redshift is lower, the absorption line is at a shorter wavelength. So the lower the z_cloud, the shorter the observed wavelength of the absorption line. So to have the absorption line in the optical, the cloud's z must be at least such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≥400 nm. Because if z_cloud is too low, the absorption line is in the UV, which can't be observed from the ground.

So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≥4000 A → 1 +z_cloud ≥4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z_cloud ≥2.29.

So the lower limit is z_cloud≈2.29, which is option C (2.4).


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of the hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption line (emitted at 1216 Å or 121.6 nm in the rest frame) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Key Formula**: The observed wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is given by:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z)
   \]
   where \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} = 121.6 \, \text{nm} \) and \( z \) is the redshift of the cloud.

2. **Optical Telescope Limitations**: Ground-based optical telescopes cannot observe wavelengths shorter than approximately 400 nm (violet light) due to atmospheric absorption of ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, the Lyman-alpha absorption line must satisfy:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 400 \, \text{nm}.
   \]

3. **Solving for the Lower Limit on Redshift**: Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 400 \, \text{nm} \) into the formula:
   \[
   400 = 121.6 \cdot (1 + z).
   \]
   Solving for \( z \):
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{400}{121.6} \approx 3.29, \quad z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29.
   \]

4. **Interpreting the Options**:
   - The calculated lower limit for \( z \) is approximately \( 2.29 \).
   - Among the given options, the closest value is \( 2.4 \) (option C).

5. **Conclusion**: For the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable in the optical range by ground-based telescopes, the hydrogen cloud must have a redshift \( z \geq 2.29 \). The lower limit is therefore best approximated by option C (\( 2.4 \)).

Answer: C
