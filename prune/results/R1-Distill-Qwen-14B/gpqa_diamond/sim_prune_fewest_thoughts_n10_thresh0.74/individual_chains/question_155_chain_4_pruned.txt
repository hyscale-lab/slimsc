Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, let's see what I remember about uncertainties and eigenstates.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like ΔP_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x, which means that when we measure P_x, we'll get that eigenvalue for sure. But since P_z and P_x might not commute, the system won't be an eigenstate of P_z. That means the expectation value of P_z won't be zero necessarily, and there will be some uncertainty.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. Let me write that down. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So that's a three-component vector. I'm assuming it's normalized since the components squared sum up to (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. So that's good.

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? That would make things easier because the components correspond to the probabilities of each eigenstate.

Wait, no. Wait. The state is given, and the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z. So each component corresponds to the amplitude for each eigenstate of P_z. So let's think about the eigenvalues of P_z. Looking at the matrix of P_z, it's diagonal. The diagonal entries are hbar, 0, -hbar. So the eigenvalues are +ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the state is a linear combination of |+ħ>, |0>, and |-ħ> with coefficients (-1/2), (1/sqrt(2)), and (-1/2), respectively.

But wait,
