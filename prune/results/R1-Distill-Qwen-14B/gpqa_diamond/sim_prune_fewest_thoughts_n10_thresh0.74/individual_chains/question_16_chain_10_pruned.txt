Okay, I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because optical activity can be a tricky topic. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again. So, the question is asking how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. There are seven compounds listed, and I need to check each one for chirality or other factors that cause optical activity.

First, I remember that optical activity is caused by the presence of chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. Or, there might be other scenarios like allenes or compounds with planar chirality, but I think for most of these, checking for chiral centers should be sufficient.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, the structure here is a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 would be Cl, a methyl group (since it's 2-methyl), and two Hs? Wait, but wait. The structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The chloro is on C1, and the substituents on C1 would be Cl, two CH2 groups (since but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a Cl on C1), but wait, wait, let me draw it. So, the molecule would be Cl-C double bond C-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but butene is four carbons. So, structure: CH2Cl-C=CH-CH3? Wait, no. The correct structure for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So, the groups on C1 are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (wait, maybe I'm getting confused here). Let me think again. The molecule is but-1-ene, so it's CH2=CHCH2CH3. Now, substituting a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So, C1 has Cl, double bond to C2, and two other substituents. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So, 1-chloro would replace one of the Hs on C1 with Cl.
