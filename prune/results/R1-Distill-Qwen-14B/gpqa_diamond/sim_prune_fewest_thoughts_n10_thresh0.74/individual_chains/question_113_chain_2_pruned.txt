Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the question carefully and think about each piece of information step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons. Let's break down each clue and see what they tell us about the structure.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around this region usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak can be from either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong absorption around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ due to the O-H stretch, which is usually broader than an alcohol's. But sometimes, an alcohol's O-H can also be broad, especially if it's in a more acidic environment or in a cyclic structure. So, I'll keep that in mind.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, the 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which typically suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). Now, the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is a bit lower than 1700. What could that be? Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a C=C stretching in an aromatic compound. Or perhaps it's another carbonyl, but at a lower wavenumber. Alternatively, it might be a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone or maybe an ester or something with resonance.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are on a double bond, so that suggests the compound has a double bond somewhere. So, either an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring, but considering the IR, maybe an alkene since we have a carbonyl and possibly another group.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about what fragments give m/z 45. Well, for example, the CH3O group would be 31 (15 for CH3 and 16 for O), but that's not 45. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COOH (which is 60, no, wait: 12*2 + 4 + 16*2 = 24+4+32=60, no). Wait, wait, maybe it's the COOH group losing something? Or perhaps a different structure.

Wait, m/z 45 could be (CH₂)₂O, but that's 44, so not that. Alternatively, what about an acetylation fragment? Or maybe it's a keto group. Another possibility is that the fragment is a ketene ion or something similar. Alternatively, the fragment could be from a CH₂=CH-O group or something else.

Now, looking at the options:
