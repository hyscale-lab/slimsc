Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC naming. Let me read the question carefully.

The question describes a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group), and a cyano group. These three are all meta to each other. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group and a dimethyl amino group. Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Also, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. Hmm, that's a lot to unpack.

I think the first step is to draw the benzene ring and place all the substituents correctly. Let's number the benzene ring in a way that makes it easier. Since the carboxylic acid is a substituent, I'll consider that as the main functional group and start numbering from there.

Wait, carboxylic acid is one of the substituents. In IUPAC naming, the principal functional group is the one with the highest priority, which for carboxylic acids is usually the case. So the numbering should start such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1.

So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Now, the substituents that are meta to each other: the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano. Since they are meta to each other, each is separated by two positions.

Wait, wait. If they are all meta to one another, that might be tricky. Let me think: meta to each other would mean that each is two positions away from the others. So if the carboxylic acid (COOH) is at position 1, the carbaldehyde (CHO) would be at position 3, and the cyano (CN) would be at position 5? Or maybe another arrangement.

Wait, no. Let's clarify: if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the other two substituents (CHO and CN) must be at positions 3 and 5, or 4 and 6, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because being meta to each other would require each substituent to be two positions apart from the others.
