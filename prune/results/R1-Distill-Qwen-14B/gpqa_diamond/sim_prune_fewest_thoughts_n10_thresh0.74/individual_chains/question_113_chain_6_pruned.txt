Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining the chemical formula of an unknown compound using various spectroscopic data. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me start by looking at the given data. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. For example, alcohols or carboxylic acids have broad O-H absorptions because of hydrogen bonding. But wait, the peak is very broad, which might suggest a strong hydrogen bonding, maybe a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure yet. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 area is where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids) absorb. 1650 is a bit lower, which might be an ester or maybe conjugated carbonyl groups. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one of them is something else.

Wait, another possibility for the 1650 peak: if it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Like a ketone with a double bond adjacent. That could lower the carbonyl peak. Also, conjugated esters might show lower frequency.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe part of a carbonyl group, like an enone structure? Or maybe a simple alkene.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is significant. Let me think about what has a mass of 45. The molecular ion could be, but 45 is a common fragment. For example, a CH3CO+ group (acetate) has a mass of 43, but wait, that's 4
