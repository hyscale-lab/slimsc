Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through step by step.

So, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma equals 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. I remember that gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need to calculate their velocities directly here. Let's see.

Annihilation produces photons, so I should think about conservation of momentum and energy. Since they're annihilating into two photons, both energy and momentum must be conserved.

But wait, wait. Positrons have the same mass as electrons but opposite charge. So the electron has charge -e, and the positron +e. Since they're moving towards each other, their momenta will be in opposite directions.

I think I should calculate the total relativistic momentum before the collision and set that equal to the total momentum after (which is the sum of the two photons' momenta).

But photons don't have mass, so their momentum is E/c, and their direction affects the vector sum. Each photon's momentum is a vector, so I need to consider their directions.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Since they're the same, each is 0.511 MeV. But wait, actually, the rest mass energy is mc², which for electron is about 0.511 MeV. But since both are annihilating, the total rest mass energy is 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV. But wait, when they annihilate, the energy comes from both their rest mass and their kinetic energy. Wait, no. Wait, annihilation converts the rest mass into energy, but in this case, they're moving, so their total energy (including kinetic) goes into the photons.

But wait, no. The rest mass of electron and positron is each 0.511 MeV, so together 1.022 MeV. But since they are moving with Lorentz factors, their total energy is gamma times mc². So for the electron, energy is 4 * 0.511 = 2.044 MeV, and for the positron, 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV. So total energy before collision is 2.044 + 1.022 = 3.066 MeV.

But wait, wait. When they annihilate, they produce two photons. The photons' energies sum to the total energy. Oh, but the problem says that both photons have the same energy. So each photon has energy 3.066 / 2 = 1.533 MeV.

Wait, but
