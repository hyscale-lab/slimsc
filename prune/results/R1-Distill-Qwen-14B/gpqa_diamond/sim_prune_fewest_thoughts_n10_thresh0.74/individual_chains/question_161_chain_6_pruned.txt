Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the setup is Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 1e-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The idea is to minimize gas molecules so that the electron microscopy is better because there's less stuff for the electrons to scatter off of.

But even with all that vacuum pumping, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them, so Mike knows they exist. He calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting about the mean free path. It's no longer λ1; it's λ2. But the temperature in the sample compartment is the same as before. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, so the mean free path λ in a gas is given by λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density of the gas, and d is the average collision diameter of the gas molecules. Or another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I think the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure and proportional to the temperature. Or wait, maybe it's λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * n), and n is proportional to pressure (n = P/(k*T)).

Wait, more accurately, the mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(n σ), where σ is the collision cross-section. And n is the number density. Since the pressure is low, the mean free path is longer because n is lower. So when pressure is low, λ is large.

But in this case, Mike starts the electron beam. So the electrons are moving through the gas. The electrons themselves will interact with the gas molecules. Oh, right, because the electrons are high-energy, they might cause more scattering or ionization of
