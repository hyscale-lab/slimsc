Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the para-isomer yield in electrophilic substitution reactions of different benzene derivatives. Let me see what I remember.

The problem states that substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine, and we need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the order should be from the one with the least para-isomer (most other isomers) to the one with the most para-isomer.

First, I need to recall which substituents on benzene are activating and which are deactivating. Activating groups make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Deactivating groups do the opposite, making the ring less reactive and directing in specific ways.

Let me list the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. It's an ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, it should go para to the methyl group. But wait, bromine is a strong electrophile, and in some cases, maybe steric effects matter, but I think for this problem, we can ignore that.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's an ethyl ester group. The ester is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So it would be a meta director. Wait, no, wait. Esters have a carbonyl which is deactivating, but they are ortho/para directors because the lone pairs from oxygen can donate through resonance. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh yes, esters are meta directors because the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring and directs the incoming electrophile to the meta positions. So for substitution, the para position would be less favored here.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is a deactivating group because it's more electronegative. But wait, chlorine is an ortho/para director because it's a halogen. Although deactivating due to inductive effect, the lone pairs on Cl can donate electrons through resonance, making the ring more reactive at ortho and para positions. So, in this case, the para position would be a major site for substitution.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating group, meta director. So in electrophilic substitution, the nitro group directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position. So the para isomer would be less likely here. Wait, no, if the substituent is meta-directing, then the para position is not the main site. For example, if the substituent is at the para position, the incoming group would go to the meta relative to it, but wait, that's getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. The nitro group is meta-directing, so the incoming electrophile (Br) will add at meta positions relative to the nitro group. So for the parent benzene, with substituent at position 1, the Br would go to 3 and 5 (meta). So in the case of the para isomer, it's when the substituent is in the para position. Wait, no, the substituent is fixed, and the Br adds in the positions relative to it. So in this case, the nitro group is in position 1, so Br would add at 3 or 5 (meta positions). So the para position, which is position 4, would not be where the Br adds. Therefore, the para-isomer isn't favored; instead, meta is favored. So the yield of the para-isomer would be low here.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify: the substituent directs where the new group goes. If the substituent is meta-directing, the new group comes in meta to it. So if the substituent is para to the incoming group, that would not be a meta position relative to itself. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think in terms of when the substituent is para to the incoming group. For a meta-directing group, the incoming group would go to the meta position relative to the substituent. So if the substituent is at position 1, the incoming group would go to position 3 or 5. Therefore, the para position (position 4) would not have a high yield. So for compound 4, the para-isomer isn't favored, so the yield is low.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethyl benzene. The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So the Br should add at the para position relative to the ethyl group. So the para-isomer would be a major product here.

6) C6H5-COOH: That's benzoic acid. The carboxylic acid group is a strong deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing effect (both inductive and resonance). So, it's a meta-directing group. Therefore, the incoming Br would add in the meta positions relative to the COOH group. So the para position would not be favored, leading to a low yield of the para-isomer.

Wait, but wait, let me think about all of these again.

For each compound:

1. Methyl (activating, o/p director): so Br adds para to methyl. So the para isomer is major, high yield.

2. Ethyl ester (COO
