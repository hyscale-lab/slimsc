Okay, so I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates into different forms depending on the pH. The given problem includes KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are related to the dissociation steps of H3PO4.

So, the solution has two components: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think these are the dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4^-) and hydrogen phosphate (HPO4^2-) ions, respectively. When these are in solution, they might form a buffer solution because they're related by the dissociation of phosphoric acid.

Wait, what's the dissociation of H3PO4? Let me jot that down. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it dissociates in three steps:

1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, the species present in the solution are H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). These two can act as a buffer because they can interconvert by donating or accepting a proton.

I remember that for a buffer solution, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, the question isn't about pH; it's about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's in solution, it's mostly dissociated. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here. Oh wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's in various forms. The concentration of orthophosphate ions would refer to H3PO4, but I think in this case, it's more about the HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-? No, wait, maybe orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- form. Or maybe not. Let me get this right.

Wait, let me clarify: The term "orthophosphate" refers to the H3PO4 molecule, but in solution, it's mostly dissociated into H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- depending on the pH. But I'm not sure if the question is asking for the concentration of H3PO4 or HPO4^2-.

Wait, the question says "orthophosphate ions". Orthophosphate ions would be PO4^3-, but that's not right because PO4^3- is the most deprotonated form. Wait, no, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. So when it's deprotonated
