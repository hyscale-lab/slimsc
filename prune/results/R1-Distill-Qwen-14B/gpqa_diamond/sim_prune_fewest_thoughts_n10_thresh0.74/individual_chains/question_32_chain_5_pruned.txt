Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6 because 3 protons and 3 neutrons add up to 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The question is asking for the energy of the nucleus. I remember that in particle accelerators, the energy is usually given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused about which one it is here. Oh wait, the question says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So I think it's referring to the total energy because the speed is given, which is related to the gamma factor in relativity.

Gamma (γ) is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So when v is 0.96c, let me calculate that. Let's see, v=0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. Subtract that from 1: 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784: since 0.28^2 is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... about 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Now, the energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m*c²). So I need to find the rest mass of the Li nucleus.

Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately... I think the atomic mass of
