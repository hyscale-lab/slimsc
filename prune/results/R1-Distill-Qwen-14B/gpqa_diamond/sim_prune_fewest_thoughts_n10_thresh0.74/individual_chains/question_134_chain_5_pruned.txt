Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, the problem gives me a mixture of multiple solutions. I need to figure out which ions will react and how much heat is released.

Let me start by listing out all the substances involved: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? It dissociates into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions.

So when these are mixed, the acids will donate H+ ions, and the base will donate OH⁻ ions. The neutralization reaction will form water and a salt. But I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH⁻ available to see which one is the limiting reagent because the neutralization depends on that.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with HCl: it's 0.2 M in 500 mL. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: it's 0.3 M in 300 mL. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic, so each molecule can donate 2 H+ ions. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Then Ba(OH)2: it's 0.5 M in 200 mL. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH⁻. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH⁻.

Now, total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles of H+.

Total OH⁻ is 0.2 moles.

Wait, so the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH⁻ → H2O. The amount of H2O formed depends on the limiting reagent. So which is less? H+ is 0.28, OH⁻ is 0.2. So OH⁻ is the limiting reagent here. That means all 0.2 moles of OH⁻ will react, and some H+ will be left.

The enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat per mole of H+ reacting. Wait, but wait, neutralization enthalpy is per mole of H+ or per mole of OH-? I think it's typically per mole of H+ or per mole of
