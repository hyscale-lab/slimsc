Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200Â°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were passed through three tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results were that tubes 1 and 3 gained 3.60 grams and 0.80 grams respectively. Tube 2 didn't change. Then, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out what's happening here. Let me break it down.

First, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose to form gases. The setup of the tubes suggests that the gases are being reacted with different substances.

Tube 1 is filled with Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can act as a drying agent, but in this case, maybe it's reacting with some of the gases. Since Mg(ClO4)2 is involved, perhaps it's reacting with water vapor or another acidic gas.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. Ca(OH)2 is a strong base. If the gas that passes through it reacts with Ca(OH)2, it would probably be an acid gas, like CO2, HCl, etc. But since tube 2's weight didn't change, that suggests that the gas passing through didn't react with the solution. Wait, but if no reaction occurred, then what's happening? Maybe the gas isn't acidic enough, or perhaps it's a neutral gas.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. So, any gas that reacts with hot copper might be something like CO2 or H2. Wait, if the copper is red-hot, maybe the gas is H2 which would react to form Cu and water, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, CO2 might not react unless it's in the presence of something else, but if the copper is hot, maybe it's acting as a catalyst? Or perhaps the gas is something like a halogen, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another thought: when CO2 is passed over hot copper, maybe it doesn't react. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like H2, which would react with copper oxide. Wait, no, copper is in the +1 or +2 oxidation state. H2 is a reducing agent. So if there's CuO, H2 would reduce it to Cu and form H2O. But in this case, the copper is just red-hot, so maybe the gas is H
