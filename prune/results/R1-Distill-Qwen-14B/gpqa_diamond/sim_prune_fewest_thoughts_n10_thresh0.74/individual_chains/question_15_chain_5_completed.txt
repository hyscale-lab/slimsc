Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and how likely the orbital plane is aligned edge-on from our perspective. Let me think about what factors influence the probability of a transit.

So, the main thing I recall is that the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But since we can't know the exact orientation, we use some statistical probabilities. I think the formula for the transit probability involves the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance.

Wait, the transit probability formula is something like R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) of the planet. But wait, I think it's actually (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else. Or maybe it's more about the orbital parameters. Oh right, the probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2 times the chance that the orbital plane is aligned.

Wait, no, another approach: The probability that a planet transits is given by (R_* + R_p) / a, where R_* is the star's radius, R_p the planet's radius, and a is the semi-major axis. But wait, if the planet's orbital plane is such that the line of sight is within the star's disk, that's when a transit occurs. So the probability is roughly (R_* + R_p) / a, but since planets are much smaller than stars, R_p is negligible compared to R_*, so it's approximately R_* / a. But wait, that's not the exact formula. Let me think again.

Oh right! The transit probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (semi-major axis), multiplied by the planet's area relative to the star's area. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_* / a)^2 times sin(i), where i is the inclination angle. But since we don't know i, we have to consider the average. The average probability is (R_* / a)^2 multiplied by some factor that accounts for the solid angle or the alignment.

Wait, no, another source I'm recalling says that the transit probability is (R_* / a) * (R_* / a) / (some factor, maybe). I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to remember the exact formula.

I think the correct formula for the transit probability is approximately (R_p + R_*)^2 / (a^2) * (R_* / a), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the probability is (R_* + R_p) / a multiplied by something else? Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, I remember that the transit probability is higher for planets with shorter orbital periods because they have smaller semi-major axes. Since the period is shorter, according to Kepler's third law, the planet is closer to the star, so a is smaller. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to a, a smaller a would mean a higher probability.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. Because a smaller a (closer in) would mean the planet has a higher chance of passing in front of the star from our viewpoint. So for two planets with the same mass but different periods, the one with a shorter period (smaller a) would have a higher transit probability.

But wait, we also have to consider the size of the star. Because if the star is bigger, the transit probability is higher. Because a larger star has a bigger disk, so the planet is more likely to block it as it transits.

Wait, in this problem, the stars have the same radii. So R_* is the same for both stars. So that part cancels out. So the main factor is the semi-major axis a.

So, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So the planet with the smaller a will have a higher chance.

But wait, let's think about Kepler's third law. Since the planets have the same mass, and their stars have different masses. Let's see, the formula for the orbital period is P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) * a^3. But since the planets' masses are much smaller than the stars', we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So P² ∝ a³ / M_*, where M_* is the mass of the star.

So, for Planet_1, the star has a mass twice that of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2 M2.

Given that Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2’s. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

From Kepler's law:

P1² / P2² = (a1³ / M1) / (a2³ / M2)

Substituting M1 = 2 M2:

(P1² / P2²) = (a1³ / (2 M2)) * (M2 / a2³) ) = (a1³) * (1/(2 a2³)) )

So:

(P1²)/(P2²) = (a1³)/(2 a2³)

But P1 = P2/3 → (P1²)/(P2²) = (1/9)

So,

(1/9) = (a1³) / (2 a2³)

→ 2 a2³ = 9 a1³ → a2³ = (9/2) a1³ → a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3)

Wait, let me compute that:

a2 = a1 * ( (9/2) )^(1/3) → 9/2 is 4.5, cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

Because 1.6^3 is 4.096, 1.65^3 is about 4.49, which is close to 4.5.

So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So the semi-major axis of Planet_2 is roughly 1.65 times that of Planet_1.

Now, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So if a1 is smaller than a2, then Planet_1's transit probability is higher.

Wait, but let me think. The transit probability (P) is roughly proportional to (R_*/a)^2.

Since both stars have the same R_*, the ratio is (1/a)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2)

Because the probability is proportional to (R_*/a)^2. So P1 is (R_*/a1)^2 and P2 is (R_*/a2)^2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2) = ( (1.65 a1)^2 ) / (a1^2 ) = (2.7225 a1²)/a1² = 2.7225. So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 is more probable to transit.

Wait, no. Wait, no, no. Because transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a)^2. So for Planet_1, it's (R_*/a1)^2, and for Planet_2, it's (R_*/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (R_*/a1)^2 / (R_*/a2)^2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2).

As a2 is approximately 1.65 a1, then a2/a1 is 1.65. So (a2/a1)^2 is (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.7225. So P1 is about 2.7 times P2.

So the probability of Planet_1 transiting is higher than Planet_2. So the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times.

But wait, I'm getting that Planet_1's probability is higher by a factor of approximately 2.72, so around 2.7 times.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Option C: 1.65 times.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the ratio of a2 to a1 was approximately 1.65. So a2 is 1.65 a1.

Wait, the transit probability is (R_* /a)^2. So since R_* is same, P1 = (R_*/a1)^2, P2=(R_*/a2)^2.

So the ratio is (a2^2)/(a1^2) = ( (1.65 a1)^2 ) / (a1^2 ) = 2.7225.

So P1 is about 2.72 times P2. So transit probability is higher for Planet_1.

So the researchers would prefer Planet_1, and the probability is higher by ~2.7 times, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \((R_*/a)^2\), where \(R_*\) is the star's radius and \(a\) is the planet's semi-major axis. Since both stars have the same radius (\(R_*\)), the probability depends inversely on \(a^2\). A smaller \(a\) results in a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
From Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M_*\), where \(P\) is the orbital period and \(M_*\) is the star's mass. For Planet_1, the period is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\(P_1 = P_2 / 3\)), and the star's mass is twice that of Planet_2's star (\(M_{*,1} = 2 M_{*,2}\)).

Using the relationship:
\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_{*,1}}{a_2^3 / M_{*,2}}
\]
Substituting \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\) and \(M_{*,1} = 2 M_{*,2}\):
\[
\frac{(1/3)^2}{1} = \frac{a_1^3 / 2}{a_2^3}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2 a_2^3}
\]
\[
2 a_2^3 = 9 a_1^3
\]
\[
a_2^3 = \frac{9}{2} a_1^3
\]
\[
a_2 = a_1 \cdot \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65 a_1
\]

Thus, the semi-major axis of Planet_2 (\(a_2\)) is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_1 (\(a_1\)).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \((R_*/a)^2\). Since \(R_*\) is the same for both stars, the ratio of transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{(R_*/a_1)^2}{(R_*/a_2)^2} = \frac{a_2^2}{a_1^2}
\]
Substituting \(a_2 \approx 1.65 a_1\):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{(1.65 a_1)^2}{a_1^2} = 1.65^2 \approx 2.72
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability (~2.7 times) compared to Planet_2.

### Final Answer:
