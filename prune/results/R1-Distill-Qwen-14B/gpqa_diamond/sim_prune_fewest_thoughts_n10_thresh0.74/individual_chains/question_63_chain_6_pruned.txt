Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I remember is a model used for diatomic molecules. The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state and needs to absorb a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Hmm, the molecule consists of elements X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are all in terms of momentum p, which is in N*s. So I need to find the photon's momentum that will cause the transition.

Wait, so the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think that in the quantum mechanical models, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. For rotation-vibration, I guess that's the ground state for both rotation and vibration. But when it absorbs a photon, it goes to the next state with the lowest energy. That probably means it goes to the first excited state. But which part changes? Do we promote it in rotation or vibration first?

In the non-rigid rotor model, I remember that the energy levels are quantized both for rotation and vibration. The fundamental state would have the lowest vibrational energy and the lowest rotational energy. To move to the next state with the lowest energy, I think it's the next vibrational state. Because increasing rotation might require higher energy, but perhaps for the lowest possible energy increase, it's the first vibrational level.

Wait, no, actually, the rotation and vibration are separate. So the next state could be either the next rotational state or the next vibrational state, whichever requires less energy. Or maybe in this problem, we're considering the transition that involves both. Hmm, but the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy', so that's the smallest possible energy increment. So it's probably a vibrational transition because vibrational energy gaps are larger than rotational ones, but wait no, that depends. Wait, the energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. For vibration
