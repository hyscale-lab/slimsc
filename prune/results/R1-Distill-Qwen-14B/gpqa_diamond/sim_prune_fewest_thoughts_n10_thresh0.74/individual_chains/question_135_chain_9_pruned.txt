Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The Lagrangian interaction is given, and we're told that the mass of X is 6 GeV. We need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson usually depends on the particles it can couple to. The interaction term in the Lagrangian tells us which fermions X can interact with. So looking at the Lagrangian provided:

L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, let me make sure I understand this term. The term looks like a Yukawa interaction. Yukawa couplings typically have a structure where a scalar (here, X(y)) interacts with fermions. The fermions ψ_f are in the loop or directly coupled, depending on the model.

So the interaction term is something like λ f ψ_f X ψ_f. That is, X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to.

But wait, the formula might need to be parsed correctly. The term is -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, that seems a bit off. Oh wait, perhaps the term is -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f? Maybe I'm misreading it. Wait, the actual expression is:

-λ f \bar{\psi}_f (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, perhaps the term is -λ f \bar{\psi}_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ_f. So X can decay into ψ_f and \bar{ψ}_f.

Wait, but the way it's written, the interaction is proportional to X. So the vertex would involve X and two fermions ψ_f.

So the boson X can decay into a fermion and an antifermion of the same type. So the possible decay products are any fermion-antifermion pairs that the X can couple to.

But wait, what particles are available? The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, the total energy available must be enough to create the fermion-antifermion pair.

Fermion masses vary. For example, top quark is about 173 GeV, way higher than X's mass. So X can't decay into top quarks because 2*m_top > m_X. Similarly, other fermions have different masses.

Let's list the fermion masses. I think the charged leptons are about: electron ~0.5 MeV, muon ~105 MeV, tau ~1.78 GeV. Quarks: up and down are light, maybe a few MeV? Then strange is about 100 MeV, charm
