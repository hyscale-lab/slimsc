Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question gives six substances, numbered 1 to 6, each substituted with different groups on a benzene ring. I need to arrange them in the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer after undergoing substitution with excess bromine. Wait, wait, but in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para.

Right, so first, I should figure out what each substituent does. The substituent's directing effect determines where the bromine will add. Also, activating or deactivating groups will affect how reactive the ring is.

Let me list the substituents:

1) С6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it's ortho/para directing. But wait, when the ring has multiple substituents, the directing can be a bit more complex. But in this case, each compound has only one substituent, except perhaps some with more. Wait, no, each is a single substituent on the benzene.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: No, wait, the formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. Oh, that's a benzoyloxyethyl group? No, wait, the structure is benzene ring with a COOEt group, which is an ester. The ester group is a meta director because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So it's deactivating and meta-directing.

3) C6H5-Cl: Cl is attached. Chlorine is an ortho/para director but deactivating because it's more electronegative. Wait, but chlorine has lone pairs, so it can donate electrons through resonance but is overall deactivating because the inductive effect outweighs the resonance? So it's ortho/para but deactivating.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group. That's a strong deactivating and meta-directing group. So the incoming electrophile will go to the meta positions relative to the nitro group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethyl group, similar to methyl. Alkyl groups are activating (electron-donating through sigma bonds), so they're ortho/para directors.

6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group. So the substituent is -COOH. That's a strong deactivating group because the carboxyl is electron-withdrawing. It's meta-directing.

Wait, but wait about the substituents and their directing effects. Let me double-check:

- Alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl) are activating, ortho/para. So groups 1 and 5 are both activating.

- Nitro (NO2) is deactivating, meta.

- Cl is ortho/para but deactivating because it's more
