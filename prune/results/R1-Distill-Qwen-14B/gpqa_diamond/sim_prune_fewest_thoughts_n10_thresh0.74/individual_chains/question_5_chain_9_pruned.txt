Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. We're given the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators often correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the states in which the observable has a definite value (the eigenvalue). So the eigenvector we're looking for should be a state where the operator P has the value +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, because if the direction is arbitrary, the operator can be expressed as a combination of the Pauli matrices. So the general form is something like P = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. But the problem gives us each component of P, so maybe I should construct the operator in the direction of n first.

Wait, no. The operator in the direction n would be along that axis, so its components would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. However, since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n_y = 0, and the direction vector is (n_x, 0, n_z). But wait, the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so the eigenvector should be aligned with that direction.

Right, so the operator P in the direction n is given by P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because P_y's contribution is zero.

Wait, actually, the problem says that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the components should be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the way the
