Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's see what I can remember. The reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The given masses are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each with two numbers, presumably the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino.

Wait, right. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products should be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its momentum p would be approximately equal to its energy (since for massless particles, E = pc). But wait, the muon has mass, so its energy is related to momentum via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². 

But wait, the question is about kinetic energy. So I need to calculate the kinetic energies of both particles. I remember that in such decay processes, the kinetic energy is shared between the two particles, but because the neutrino is massless, it will carry away most of the energy, I think.

Let me think about the mass difference. The pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so the total rest mass of the products is 105.7 + 0 (since neutrino's mass is negligible). So the mass difference is 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. But wait, that's the Q value, which is the total energy available for kinetic energy. Because in decay processes, the Q value is the total kinetic energy of the products.

So the total kinetic energy (K_total) is 33.9 MeV. Now, this energy is split between the muon and the neutrino. But how?

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum. Let's denote the kinetic energies as K_mu and K_nu. But wait, neutrino's kinetic energy is its total energy because its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = K_nu. The muon's total energy E_mu is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, so E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

Since momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. So p_mu = p_nu. But for the muon, p_mu = sqrt(E_mu^2 - (105.7)^2) / c², or something like that. Wait, the units here are MeV and energies. Let me try to write the equations.

Energy conservation: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu. E_pi is 139.6 MeV. So,

139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + E_nu.

Momentum conservation: p_mu = p_nu. Since the neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu c. Similarly, for the muon, E_mu² = (p_mu c)^2 + (105.7)^2 c^4. But since p_mu = p_nu, we can write E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7 c²)^2.

Let me make substitutions. Let me set E_nu = x. Then, energy equation becomes:

139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + x.

But K_mu = E_mu - 105.7. So substituting E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu, but that seems circular. Alternatively, let me express everything in terms of x.

From momentum conservation: E_mu = sqrt( (x c)^2 + (105.7 c²)^2 ) / c². Wait, wait, let's think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. Because all energies are given in MeV (which is MeV c² when considering mass terms?), but I might be getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to set c=1 so that E² = p² + m². Then, because E_pi = 139.6 MeV is the total energy, and the muon has E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2), and E_nu = p, since for the neutrino, E = p (since m=0). 

So the energy equation is:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

Let me let p be a variable. So,

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

Hmm, I can solve for p. Let me subtract p from both sides:

139.6 - p = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2).

Now square both sides:

(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding left side:

139.6² - 2*139.6*p + p² = p² + 105.7².

Simplify:

139.6² - 2*139.6*p = 105.7².

Compute 139.6² and 105.7².

139.6 squared: approx (140)^2 = 19600, but 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2= 140^2 -2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2= 19600 - 112 + 0.16= 19488.16 MeV².

105.7 squared: 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross terms 2*105*0.7=147. So 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So plug into the equation:

19488.16 - 2*139.6*p = 11172.49.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 p.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49: 19488.16 minus 11172.49 is approximately 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 p.

Wait, 2 * 139.6 is 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2. Let's compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2. Let's approximate.

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 29.78 times? Hmm, let's compute 279.2 * 29.78.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

279.2 * 29.78 is 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 *0.22= approx 61.4. So 8376 -61.4= 8314.6. Oh, that's very close to 8315.67. So p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c. Wait, but in our units, with c=1, so it's just MeV.

Wait, but wait, I think because we set c=1, the units for p are MeV/c, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the calculation gives p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting p as about 29.78 MeV/c. Then, E_nu is p c, but since c=1, E_nu is 29.78 MeV.

Then E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt(29.78^2 + 105.7^2).

Compute 29.78^2: approx 886.8.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sum is 886.8 +11172.49 = 12059.29. Square root is sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu is 109.81 MeV, which is the total energy, so the kinetic energy K_mu is E_mu - m_mu c^2 = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

Wait, because m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², and E is in MeV, so E_mu is 109.81 MeV, so K_mu is 4.11 MeV.

And E_nu is p c, which is 29.78 MeV. So K_nu is 29.78 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have approximated too much.

Let me recalculate 139.6². Let me compute it more accurately.

139.6 * 139.6:

= (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7²: 105.7 *105.7. Let's compute:

100² = 10,000.

5.7²=32.49.

2*(100)*(5.7)= 1140.

So (100 +5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2= 10,000 +1140 +32.49=11,172.49 MeV².

So in the equation:

19488.16 - 2*139.6 p = 11172.49.

So 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Set equal to 2*139.6 p = 279.2 p.

So p=8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.78 is 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 *0.22=61.424.

So 8376-61.424=8314.576, which is about 8314.576. The numerator is 8315.67. So the difference is 8315.67 -8314.576=1.094.

So, 279.2 * x =1.094. x=1.094/279.2≈0.00392.

So p≈29.78 +0.00392=29.78392 ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu is 29.78 MeV.

E_mu= sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

(29.78)^2= approx 886.8.

(105.7)^2=11172.49.

Sum is 886.8 +11172.49=12059.29.

Square root of 12059.29 is sqrt(12059.29). Let's calculate that:

109^2=11881, 110^2=12100. So 109.8^2= (109 +0.8)^2=109² + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2=11881 + 174.4 +0.64=12056.04.

That's very close to 12059.29. The difference is 12059.29 -12056.04=3.25.

So 109.8^2=12056.04.

109.81^2= (109.8 +0.01)^2=109.8^2 + 2*109.8*0.01 +0.0001=12056.04 +2.196 +0.0001=12058.2361.

Still less than 12059.29. The target is 12059.29.

Compute 109.81^2= approx 12058.2361.

109.82^2= (109.81 +0.01)^2=109.81^2 + 2*109.81 *0.01 +0.0001=12058.2361 + 2.1962 +0.0001=12060.4324.

Wait, but our sum is 12059.29, which is between 109.81^2 and 109.82^2.

Compute 12059.29 -12058.2361=1.0539.

Between 109.81 and 109.82, each 0.01 increase in x increases x² by about 2*109.81 *0.01=2.1962.

So 1.0539 /2.1962 ≈0.482 of the interval. So the square root is approximately 109.81 +0.482*0.01=109.81482 MeV.

So E_mu≈109.8148 MeV.

Subtract the rest mass: 109.8148 -105.7=4.1148 MeV.

So K_mu≈4.1148 MeV, approximately 4.11 MeV.

And E_nu is 29.78 MeV, which is the neutrino's kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to our calculated values.

Wait, but looking at the options, D is 4.12 and 29.8. So that should be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check the initial equation again.

Wait, the energy equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 +105.7²) + p.

Subtract p:

139.6 - p = sqrt(p^2 +105.7²).

Square both sides:

(139.6 -p)^2 = p^2 +105.7².

Expanding left side: 139.6² - 2*139.6 p +p² = p² +105.7².

Subtract p² from both sides:

139.6² -2*139.6 p =105.7².

So 139.6² -105.7² =2*139.6 p.

Compute 139.6² -105.7².

That's (139.6 -105.7)(139.6 +105.7) = (33.9)(245.3) .

Compute 33.9 *245.3.

30 *245.3=7359.

3.9 *245.3= let's compute 3 *245.3=735.9, 0.9 *245.3=220.77. So 735.9 +220.77=956.67.

Total is 7359 +956.67=8315.67.

So 2*139.6 *p =8315.67 → p=8315.67/(2*139.6)= 8315.67/279.2=29.78 MeV/c.

So that part is correct.

So, E_mu is sqrt(29.78² +105.7²)=sqrt(886.8 +11172.49)=sqrt(12059.29)=approx 109.81 MeV.

Kinetic energy of muon is 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

E_nu is 29.78 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the closest.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \text{ (at rest)} \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest mass of the pion is \( 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \), and the rest mass of the muon is \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The neutrino is massless. The total energy available for kinetic energy is the Q-value of the decay:

\[
Q = m_{\pi^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 1: Energy and Momentum Conservation
The total energy of the pion is its rest energy, \( E_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \). After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:

\[
E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]

The muon's total energy is related to its momentum \( p_{\mu^+} \) by:

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]

and the neutrino's energy is simply \( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} \) (since it is massless). By conservation of momentum, \( p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu} \). Substituting \( p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu} \) into the energy equation:

\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p,
\]

where \( p = p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu} \).

### Step 2: Solving for \( p \)
Rearranging the equation:

\[
139.6 - p = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 105.7^2.
\]

Substitute \( 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):

\[
19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 11172.49.
\]

\[
8315.67 = 279.2 \cdot p.
\]

Solving for \( p \):

\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculating Energies
The neutrino's energy is:

\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's total energy is:

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]

Substitute \( 29.78^2 = 886.8 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:

\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: \( 2.84 \, \text{MeV}, 26.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option B**: \( 7.2 \, \text{MeV}, 32.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option C**: \( 3.52 \, \text{MeV}, 20.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Correct.

Answer: D
