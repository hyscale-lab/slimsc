Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I'm supposed to find the partition function Z. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to find all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-βE) for all of them.

Each spin has two possibilities: +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll need to list all these states and compute the energy for each.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 cases. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy depends on the products of pairs of spins. Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1, because S_i and S_j are each +1 or -1. So S_i S_j = 1 if they're the same, and -1 if opposite.

So let me compute the terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 for each possible state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to group the states based on the number of aligned vs. anti-aligned pairs. Or maybe based on the value of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, the energy E is proportional to the sum of these terms. So let me compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each possible state.

But maybe it's easier to consider the possible values of this sum. Let me denote H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J H.

So for each state, I'll compute H and then the Boltzmann factor exp(β J H), because E = -J H → -βE = β J H. So each term is exp(β J H).

So Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(β J H).

H can take different values. Let me figure out all possible H values and how many states correspond to each H.

Let me think about possible combinations.

First, for each spin configuration, compute H.

Case 1: All spins up (+1, +1, +1). So S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

H = (1*1) + (1*1) + (1*1) = 3.

Case 2: Two spins up, one down. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

H = (1*1) + (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

Wait, but the way H is calculated, it's the
