Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, wait, C3H6 is propene or propylene, right? Because the molecular formula for propene is C3H6. So, Compound A is propene.

First reaction: Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form Compound B. Bromination of alkenes usually adds bromine across the double bond, so propene (which is CH₂=CHCH3) would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, no, bromination of propene would add Br across the double bond, making it 1,2-dibromopropane. So that would be the structure CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next step: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form Compound C. Alcoholic KOH is a base, and I'm thinking elimination reaction. So, when a dibromide like 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it's likely an E2 elimination. So, each Br is in adjacent carbons, so when one Br leaves, the other would be abstracted by the base, causing elimination of HBr and forming a double bond again. Wait, but wait, 1,2-dibromopropane would eliminate two HBr molecules, right? Because each adjacent Br can be eliminated in a process. So the product would be propene again? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, when a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromo) reacts with a strong base, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation. So, for 1,2-dibromopropane, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, and the adjacent Br would leave, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, where would the double bond form? Let's see: the molecule is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When the base abstracts a hydrogen from the middle carbon (CHBr) adjacent
