Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. So, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable P and getting a value of 0. Let me start by going through the problem step by step.

First, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Hmm, wait, maybe I should check if this vector is normalized. To do that, I'll calculate its magnitude squared.

The state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state would be 1/sqrt(6) times [-1, 2, 1]. But wait, the problem doesn't mention normalization. Does that matter? I think in quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors. So perhaps I should normalize it first. Otherwise, the probabilities might not sum to 1, which is a problem.

So, I'll proceed by normalizing the state vector. The normalized state |ψ> becomes (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me note that down.

Next, the observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Wait, I should write this matrix out properly. Let me see:

P = [
    [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
    [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
    [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Now, the observable P is represented by this matrix. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of P. So, to find the probability of getting 0, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.

Alternatively, another approach is to note that if P is the observable, the possible outcomes are its
