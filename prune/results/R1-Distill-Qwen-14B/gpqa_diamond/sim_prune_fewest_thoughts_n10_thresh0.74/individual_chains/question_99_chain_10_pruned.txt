Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's start by going through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak in that region usually indicates O-H stretching. Since it's very broad, it's probably from an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches that are usually broad because the hydrogen bonds are strong and variable. So that makes me think the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Then, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a key region for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. Since the 1700 is a bit lower than a typical carboxylic acid carbonyl (which is usually around 1700-1725), but wait—actually, carboxylic acids do show around 1700. So that fits with the O-H from before. So the compound has a COOH group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. The question says that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to double bonds, so that means the compound doesn't have any double bonds, or at least no protons attached to double bonds. So no alkenes or aromatic rings with protons—so it's not something like an alkene or benzene. So all the hydrogens are probably in single bonds.

Now, looking at the NMR signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. Splitting occurs due to coupling with neighboring protons.

Wait, a doublet of triplets—so maybe each proton is splitting into a doublet, and then each of those is splitting into triplets again. Or maybe the other way around. Let me think: when you have multiple coupling partners, the splitting can get complex. For example, a triplet of triplets would be each peak split into three, and then each of those three split into three again, leading to nine peaks (but that's probably simplified in the question).

Alternatively, a doublet of triplets suggests that the proton is next to two sets of neighboring protons. Let's think about possible structures.

Looking at the options, all of them have a COOH group at the end. Let me look at the structures:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the structure is like two substituents on the central carbons. Breaking it down: the central part is C(H)(C2H5) connected to another C(H)(C2H5), and then a CH2COOH at the end.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. Here, the structure is CH2CH2 attached to a central C with substituents, and then COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, two substituents on the central carbons are methyl groups, and then a CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. The central carbons each have a CH3 and a CH2CH3 substituent, leading to COOH.

Wait, the structures might be better drawn as:

Option A: The central part is two CH(C2H5) groups attached to a CH2COOH.

Option B: The central part is (CH2CH3)-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH, but wait, no, the structure is CH3CH2C... So the substituents on the central carbons are CH2CH3 and H, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine each structure.

Looking at the NMR, the key is to see what kind of splitting is happening. The presence of multiple coupling suggests that the proton is next to multiple sets of non-equivalent protons.

Let's think about a proton that's adjacent to two different types of hydrogens. For example, if a CH is next to a CH2 and another CH2, perhaps it would have a complex splitting.

Wait, another approach: in the NMR, the splitting can tell us about the neighboring groups. If a proton is next to two different groups with different numbers of protons, each group will cause splitting.

Let me think of a structure where a CH group is next to two different CH2 groups. Alternatively, maybe each CH has two different adjacent groups.

Looking at the options, perhaps the structure has branching. For example, in option C: the substituents on the central carbons are CH3 and CH3, each. Then, the structure is something like (CH3)2C-C(CH3)2-CH2COOH?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like:

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the middle is two central carbons, each attached to a CH3 and a H, connected to each other. Then, a CH2COOH at the end.

So, looking at the structure, each of the central CH groups would be connected to two adjacent CH groups. Wait, no, each CH is connected to another CH and to the next group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is like:

CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So each central carbon is CH with substituents CH3 and another CH.

In that case, the H on each central carbon would be adjacent to two other sets of Hs.

Alternatively, for each CH group, the adjacent groups are the other CH (from the central part) and the CH2 group.

Wait, that might complicate the splitting. Let me think: for a proton on a CH group, adjacent to another CH and a CH2 group.

The H on the central CH would be next to the Hs on the neighboring CH, and the Hs on the CH2.

So, the H on the central CH would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH and the CH2.

Wait, the adjacent CH has how many Hs? Each central CH is CH, so the adjacent CH would have
