Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty of the operator P_z, denoted as ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

Wait, but what is the given state? The system is found in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. Oh wait, no, the problem says it's in that state, which is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2]. I should probably check if this is normalized, but let me see. The sum of squares is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Now, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the standard basis for Pauli matrices? Wait, no, because the matrices given are 3x3, so maybe it's for spin-1 particles. Because spin-1 has three states: m_s = -1, 0, +1. So the basis vectors are |1>, |0>, |-1>, with P_z diagonal, as given in the matrix. Looking at P_z's matrix, it's diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ, corresponding to m_s = 1, 0, -1. So each basis vector is |m_s> where m_s is 1, 0, -1.

Now, the state is given in this basis, so ψ is a linear combination of these |m_s> states. So |ψ> = (-1/2)|1> + (1/sqrt(2))|0> + (-1/2)|-1>.

To find the uncertainty in P_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

First, let's find ⟨P_z⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So the components are:

|a_1|^2 = (1/4), and the eigenvalue is ħ.

|a_0|^2 = (1/2), eigenvalue 0.

|a_{-1}|^2 = (1/4), eigenvalue -ħ.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0. So that's zero.

Next, ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared will have eigenvalues squared, which for the eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ are ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ΔP_z² = ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (1/2 ħ^2) - 0 = 1/2 ħ². Thus, ΔP_z is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2). So the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, let me double
