Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around here usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those regions are important. The 1700 cm^-1 is indicative of carbonyl groups, maybe like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe acid. The 1650 cm^-1 is a bit lower, which might suggest something like an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a C=O in a conjugated system or maybe an amide, but amides usually have lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, a carbonyl in an ester or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait. If there are two strong peaks around 1700 and 1650, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Like, the compound might have a carbonyl group and another group that's conjugated to it, such as an aromatic ring. For instance, an aromatic ester or something like that.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are those on a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, perhaps conjugated with the carbonyl group. So maybe a structure like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. That would fit with the IR dataâ€”like a ketone or ester with a double bond nearby.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Let's think about common fragments. At m/z 45, possible fragments could be a ketene ion (CH2CO), or maybe a CH3CO+ fragment. Or perhaps it's the tropylium ion, but that's more around 120. Alternatively, common groups: like a CH3CHO (which would be 45?), but wait, CH3CHO is acetaldehyde. The molecular ion for acetaldehyde is 44 (CH3CHO is 44?), but wait, m/z 45 could be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the (CH3CO) group, which is 43? Wait, maybe I should calculate. CH3CO+ would be (12*2 + 1*3 + 16) = 24 + 3 +16 = 43. Hmm, but the peak is at 45. Or maybe it's a fragment that includes an oxygen, like CH3COO (which would be 12*2 +1*3 +16*2 = 24 +3 +32 =59, which is higher). Alternatively, perhaps it's a smaller fragment. Let me think of other possibilities. 

Wait, another thought: the fragment at m/z 45 could be the acylium ion. The acylium ion is [CH3CO]+, which is 43. Hmm, but 45 is two more. Maybe it's (CH2CO)+, which would be 43 + 2 =45? Oh wait, CH2CO is 12*2 + 1*2 +16 = 24 +2 +16=42. No, that's 42. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Or maybe the fragment is a ketone group. Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecular formula can help. Let's look at the options.

Options are:

A) C6H12O2
