Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with such problems, I need to consider the method of images or maybe how the charges distribute on the sphere.

Wait, the setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. The sphere is grounded, which means any excess charge on it will go to the ground. So the sphere itself remains neutral, right? Or wait, no. Wait, being grounded allows the sphere to maintain zero potential. So any induced charges will adjust to keep the potential of the sphere zero.

Oh right, for a conducting sphere, any external charge will induce an opposite charge on the near side and a same charge on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can't build up; instead, the sphere's potential is kept at zero by allowing charges to flow in or out.

So, the sphere acts as if it's at zero potential. So when the charge q is placed near it, the sphere's induced charges will arrange to keep its potential zero. But I'm being asked about the potential energy of the system.

Potential energy in such cases is usually calculated by considering the work done to bring the charges together. But wait, the charge q is placed by itself, and the sphere is already grounded. So perhaps the potential energy arises due to the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Alternatively, I remember that the potential energy of a system can be found by considering the work done in assembling the charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential is zero, so maybe the induced charges are not static but depend on the charge q.

Wait, another approach. The potential energy U of the system can be thought of as the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, it's connected to the Earth, which is considered at zero potential. So the induced charges on the sphere are due to the external charge q.

Let me think about image charges. For a grounded sphere, when a charge q is placed outside, the sphere can be modeled using an image charge inside. Wait, no, the method of images says that the sphere would have an image charge such that the potential on the sphere remains zero. So the image charge would be inside the sphere, and the system would have energy based on the interaction between q and the image charge.

Wait, here's a thought: the sphere being grounded means that the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at any point outside the sphere is due to the charge q and the image charge. But perhaps the image charge is inside the sphere, so the image charge would be at a point inside, but since the sphere is conducting, the image charge must be placed such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, the image charge method for a sphere. So when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere can be modeled by an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge q' is located at a distance of (R^2)/d from the center, where R is the radius of the sphere and d is the distance of q from the center.

Wait, let me get that straight. If the original charge is at a distance d from the center, then the image charge would be at a distance d' = (R^2)/d from the center, but on the opposite side. So the distance between q and the image charge q' would be d + d' = d + (R^2/d) = (d² + R²)/d.

Wait, but what is the magnitude of the image charge? I think for a conducting sphere, the image charge is given by q' = - (q R^2)/d^2. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that for a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the image charge inside is such that the potential on the surface is zero. So the image charge q' must satisfy some condition.

Wait, let's think about the potential at the surface of the sphere. The sphere is a conductor, so the potential is the same everywhere on its surface. The potential due to q at a point on the sphere is (kq)/(R), since the distance from q to the surface is d - R (wait, no, wait, the distance from q to the center is d, so the distance from q to a point on the surface would be sqrt(d² + R² - 2dR cosθ), but that's complicated. Alternatively, the average potential due to q on the sphere's surface is (kq)/(d). Wait, no, the potential at any point on the sphere due to q is (kq)/(distance from q to that point). But since the sphere is conducting, the potential due to induced charges must cancel the potential from q on the surface.

Wait, maybe another approach. The sphere being conducting ensures that the potential is the same everywhere on its surface. The potential due to the external charge q plus the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere must be zero on the surface. The induced charges can be treated as a dipole or, using the image method, as a point charge inside.

So, the image charge q' is such that the potential due to q and q' is zero on the sphere's surface. The image charge is inside the sphere, so it's at a distance d' from the center, where d' = R²/d. So, the image charge q' is equal in magnitude to q, but opposite in sign? Or is it a different value?

Wait, I think the image charge q' for a grounded sphere is given by q' = - q (R/d)². Let me think. Because the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential due to q and the induced charges (which can be modeled as a point charge q' inside) must sum to zero.

Wait, the image charge method formula is that the image charge q' is located at a distance r' from the center, where r' = R²/d. So the distance between q and q' is d - r' = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

Since the sphere is conducting, the potential on its surface is zero. So the sum of potentials from q and q' must be zero on the sphere's surface.

Let me compute the potential at a point on the sphere due to q and q'. The distance from the point to q is (d² + R² - 2dR cosθ)^½, but that's complicated. Alternatively, the average potential. Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the image charge such that the potential on the sphere is zero. So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q and q' must be zero. The potential due to q is kq/(distance from q to the point on sphere). The potential due to q' is kq'/(distance from q' to that point). So the sum is zero.

But since the sphere is symmetric, the image charge must lie along the line connecting the center and q. So for any point on the sphere's surface, the potential from q and q' must cancel. Let me pick a point on the sphere along the line connecting q and the center. At that point, the distance from q is (d - R) and the distance from q' is (R - (R²/d)) )= R (d- R)/d.

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps using the image charge method, the image charge q' is inside the sphere, and the sphere's surface potential is zero. So the potential due to q and q' must cancel at every point on the sphere.

So, the potential due to q at the surface is (k q)/(R), because the distance from q to the center is d, so the distance from q to a point on the surface in the direction away from q is d + R? No, wait. If the point on the surface is in the same direction as q, then the distance from q to that point is d - R. Wait, no, because d is the distance from q to the center. So the point on the surface in the direction of q is at a distance d - R from q. The point opposite is at d + R.

Wait, maybe the potential at the point on the sphere in the direction of q is (k q)/(d - R), and the potential due to the image charge would be (k q')/(R - (R²/d)) ) = (k q')*(d/(d - R)).

Wait, R - (R²/d) is R (1 - R/d) )= R (d - R)/d. So the distance for q' is R (d - R)/d. So the potential due to q' is k q' / [ R (d - R)/d ] = (k q' d) / ( R (d - R) ) ).

So, the sum of potentials from q and q' at this point must be zero.

So, (k q)/(d - R) ) + (k q' d)/( R (d - R) ) = 0.

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q + (k q' d)/ R = 0.

Divide both sides by k:

q + (q' d)/ R = 0.

So, (q' d)/ R = - q → q' = - (q R) / d.

Ah, so the image charge is q' = - (q R)/d, and it is located at a distance of (R²)/d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere from q.

Wait, but I thought the image charge is inside. Since R < d, R²/d is less than R, so yes, it's inside the sphere.

Now, the potential energy of the system is the potential energy due to the interaction between the charge q and the image charge q'. Because the sphere is grounded, the image charge is the result of the induced charges, and the system's potential energy would be that of the two charges q and q'.

But wait, the potential energy U between two charges is U = (1/2) k (q)(q') / r, where r is the distance between them.

In this case, q' is -q R/d, and the distance between q and q' is (d - R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So, the distance r = (d² - R²)/d.

So, substituting into U:

U = (1/2) k * q * ( - q R/d ) / [ (d² - R²)/d ].

Simplify denominator:

[ (d² - R²)/d ] → denominator is (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So, U = (1/2) k * q * (- q R/d ) * d/( (d^2 - R^2) )

Wait, the d in the numerator and denominator will cancel.

So,

U = (1/2) k * q * (- q R) / (d² - R² )

= - (1/2) k q² R / (d² - R^2 )

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D is U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2 ), which matches.

But wait another thing: the potential energy could be the energy stored in the system, but since the sphere is conducting and grounded, maybe the energy comes only from the charge q and the image charge. But I'm not entirely sure if I should consider the potential energy of the image charge as part of the system's energy, because the image charge is a construct, not a real charge.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. But the sphere being grounded, its potential is zero, so the induced charges are part of the system. So when we bring the charge q near the sphere, the work done is against the electric field created by the induced charges. Alternatively, the potential energy is due to the charge q in the potential created by the sphere. But since the sphere is at zero potential, that might not contribute. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the potential energy of the system when a point charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d² - R²). That's the option D.

Wait, but let me think again. The image charge is inside the sphere, so the potential energy between q and the image charge is (1/2) k (q)(q')/r. Since q' is negative, the product is negative, leading to a negative potential energy.

So, plugging in the numbers, U is negative, as I did earlier, and that gives option D.

Looking at the options:

Option D) U = - (1/2) kq² R/(d² - R²)

Yes, that's what I got. So the correct answer should be D.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the induced charges on the grounded conducting sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, and the induced charges adjust to maintain this condition. The problem can be analyzed using the method of images.

When a charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of the sphere, the sphere's induced charges can be modeled as an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere. The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( d' = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center, along the line connecting the charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is given by \( q' = -\frac{qR}{d} \).

The distance between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is \( r = d - d' = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \). The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the energy of the interaction between \( q \) and \( q' \), which is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{r}.
\]

Substituting \( q' = -\frac{qR}{d} \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \), we get:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \left(-\frac{qR}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
\]

Simplifying, the \( d \) in the numerator and denominator cancels:

\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} k \frac{q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
\]

Thus, the net potential energy of the system is:

\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{kq^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**Option D: \( U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{kq^2 R}{d^2 - R^2} \).**

Answer: D
