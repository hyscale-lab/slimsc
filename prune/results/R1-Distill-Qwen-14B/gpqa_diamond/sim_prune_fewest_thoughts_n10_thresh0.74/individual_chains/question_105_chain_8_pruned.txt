Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, which have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe the star over time, its brightness will vary periodically as it rotatesâ€”this is similar to how an exoplanet transiting a star causes a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: What would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve, assuming the star wasn't covered by these spots?

So, the key here is to calculate the change in brightness when a planet transits the star and compare it to the change caused by the star's spots.

First, let me understand what the situation with the star's spots does to the observed brightness. When the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view and then the other side. Because the spots are cooler (T=5000K, since 6000-1000=5000), they emit less light. So when that hemisphere is visible, the total brightness should decrease.

The filling factor is 20%, meaning that 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. But wait, is the filling factor per hemisphere or the entire star? The problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So I think that means 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So each hemisphere (assuming the star is a sphere) has 20% spots. But wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. Let me think.

Wait, the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So the other hemisphere is spot-free. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere's surface that is covered by spots. So each hemisphere (like the front and back) is either 20% spots or 0, in this case? Or does it mean that the entire star has 20% of its surface covered? No, because it's one hemisphere. So one hemisphere has 20% of its area in spots.

Wait, the problem states: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So the spots occupy 20% of each hemisphere's surface? Or just of the hemisphere that's spotty? Hmm, perhaps it's that 20% of the hemisphere is spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux, making the overall brightness dip.

Wait, maybe I don't need to get too tangled in that. Let me think about what the observed brightness variation would be due to the spots.

When the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower. The brightness variation arises because when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into and goes out of view, modulating the total light we
