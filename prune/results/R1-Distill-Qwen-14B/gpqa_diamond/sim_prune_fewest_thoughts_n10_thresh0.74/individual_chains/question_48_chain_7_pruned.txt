Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first step is treating it with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, bromine and ketones... Oh right! That's the bromination reaction, probably the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone, and when you add bromine (Br2) in a diethyl ether solution, it's a bromination via an enol intermediate. So, the keto-enol tautomerism comes into play here. The cyclohexanone would form an enol, which then reacts with bromine to add a bromine atom. So product 1 should be 2-bromocyclohexanone. Wait, or is it 3-bromocyclohexanone? No, wait, the enol is formed at the alpha position, so the bromine adds to the alpha carbon. So, the alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl, so the bromine would be at position 2, making it 2-bromocyclohexanone. So product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Next step, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. Okay, so sodium hydroxide is a strong base. 2-bromocyclohexanone with NaOH. Wait, the bromine is at an alpha position, adjacent to the carbonyl. So heating with base might lead to elimination. Oh wait, the bromide is on the alpha carbon, so it could undergo an E2 elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution? But wait, bromides on alpha carbons might undergo elimination when treated with a base because they're adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the base abstracts a beta proton, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond. So, the product would be a cyclohexene, specifically 1-cyclohexene? Wait, let me think about the structure. Cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with the carbonyl at position 1. The bromine is at position
