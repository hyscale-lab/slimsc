Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out how many loops a Feynman diagram has based on the given expression. Hmm, let's see. 

The problem says that the colleague has a note with a string of constants and ratios: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And the question is about how many loops the Feynman diagram has. The options are A)6, B)2, C)1, D)3.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams with loops contribute to loop diagrams, and the number of loops relates to the order of the process. Each loop typically adds a factor of a certain dimension, but more importantly, the number of loops affects the integrals and the dependence on physical constants.

I think the general idea is that the degree of divergence or the superficial degree of divergence depends on the number of loops. But how does that tie into the given expression?

I recall that each loop in a Feynman diagram usually contributes a factor of the coupling constant and some factors from integrals, possibly involving pi and maybe the energy scales. Also, the number of loops affects the overall scaling with energy.

Wait, another approach: the superficial degree of divergence is given by D = 4 - L*( (4 - (E-P))/2 ), where L is the number of loops, E is the number of external lines, and P is the number of propagators. But maybe that's too complicated here.

Alternatively, I think that each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a certain power of the energy scale, and the overall scaling of the amplitude depends on the number of loops. For example, a one-loop diagram usually contributes a term that's proportional to some coupling constants and possibly logarithms or powers of the energy.

Looking at the given expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4pi epsilon_0) or something like that, but in QFT terms, alpha is equal to g_YM^2/(4pi), where g_YM is the Yang-Mills coupling. Hmm, but maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, the expression is: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 *
