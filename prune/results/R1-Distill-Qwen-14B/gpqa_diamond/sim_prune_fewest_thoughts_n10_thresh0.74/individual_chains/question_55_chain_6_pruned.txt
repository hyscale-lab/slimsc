Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are all some sort of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. I remember that the configuration (cis or trans) affects the NMR signals, especially the coupling between protons.

Let me look at the NMR data again. The peaks are at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). Hmm.

I think the first thing to note is the singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H. That's probably the acetate group's methyl (OAc). The singlet makes sense because the three methyl protons are equivalent and not split by any neighboring protons.

Then there's a doublet at 7.0 ppm with a coupling constant of 16 Hz. Oh wait, that's a large coupling, so it's probably between two protons that are trans to each other. Like in a double bond. So maybe a vinyl proton. Wait, but why is it a doublet? Maybe because it's coupled to one other proton.

Then the peak at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruples (dq). Hmm, that's a bit tricky. A doublet of quartets suggests that this proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons. Maybe it's a proton adjacent to a double bond that's next to another group.

And the peak at 1.6 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to something that's causing the splitting. Maybe a CH2 or CH group nearby.

Wait, let's think about the structures. The options are all propenyl or butenyl acetates. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2OAc or similar, but with different configurations.

Let me sketch some possibilities. For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But if it's cis or trans, that affects the coupling in the NMR.

Wait, wait
