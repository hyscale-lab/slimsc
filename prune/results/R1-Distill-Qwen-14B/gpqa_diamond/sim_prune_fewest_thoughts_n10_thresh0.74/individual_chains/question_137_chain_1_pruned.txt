Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. 

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is almost zero. It goes through two accelerations and reaches a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, I remember that in cyclotrons, particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. Synchrocyclotrons are a type where the magnetic field is kept constant, right? Or wait, isn't it the opposite? Wait, no, I think in a regular cyclotron, the frequency is constant, but in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field increases with time to keep the cyclotron frequency in sync with the accelerating voltage. Or was it the other way around? Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the key point is that in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time such that the cyclotron frequency matches the frequency of the applied voltage. Because the particle's mass and charge are constant, the frequency ν depends on the magnetic field B as ν = (qB)/(2πm). So as B increases, ν increases. So the voltage has to be adjusted to match this frequency. But in this problem, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. Hmm, maybe ν(α) is a function that relates to the changing magnetic field or something else. Oh wait, I think in the synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν of the applied voltage depends on the particle's momentum. So maybe ν(α) refers to the angular frequency that depends on the particle's state, which is a function of time as the proton gains energy.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the energy part. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0, and ends up at 950 MeV. Since the synchrocyclotron accelerates the proton in a way that the electric field does work on it, I think the kinetic energy
