Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, so the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it compares to an exoplanet in terms of the brightness variation observed.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, meaning 20% of that hemisphere is spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots are at 5000K, right?

The star's brightness variations are observed because of rotational modulation—so as the star spins, the spots come into and out of view, causing changes in the light curve. The problem says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet. That is, the dip in brightness when the planet transits the star is similar to the dip caused by the spots.

But here's the twist: we need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the spots do. So if the star wasn't spotted, what planet size would give the same signal?

Let me think about the formula for the light curve dip when a planet transits the star. The dip in brightness (ΔF) is given by the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So, ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots which affect the observed light. The spots are cooler and darker, so when they're on the visible side, the total brightness we observe is less. So the variation due to the spots is like a periodic dip in brightness as the star rotates.

So I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, set that equal to the dip caused by a planet and solve for R_planet / R_star.

First, let's calculate the effect of the spots on the star's brightness. The spots are cooler, so each spot emits less flux. The star's total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

The star is a sphere; each hemisphere is half the surface. But wait, one hemisphere is 100% covered with spots, but the filling factor is
