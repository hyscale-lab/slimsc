Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, we need to find the correct equation for the effective temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The population of a particular energy level is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So, if the energy levels are E1 and E2, the ratio of populations would be (n1/n2) = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). But wait, in this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J, assuming E2 is higher than E1.

Wait, the problem states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the population ratio for star_1 compared to star_2 is 2. Let's denote the populations as n1 and n2 for star_1 and star_2, respectively. So, n1/n2 = 2.

Using the Boltzmann factor for each star:

n1 = (g1 / g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
n2 = (g1 / g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no, I think the Boltzmann factor is (n_i) / (n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). But since we're considering the same transition, perhaps the g factors (statistical weights) are the same for both stars, so they cancel out when taking the ratio.

So, n1/n2 = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T2) )

Wait, no. Wait, n1 is the population for star_1 at level E2, and n2 is the same for star_2. So, perhaps each n is proportional to exp
