Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here where a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and I need to figure out what it is using the spectral data provided. Let's go through this step by step.

First, let me look at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158, which is 32% of the intensity. Hmm, I remember that when you have two peaks in the mass spec, especially with a +2, sometimes it's due to chlorine. Chlorine has a mass of about 35, but wait, the molecular ion is 156 and the other is 158, so that's a difference of 2. Oh, right, chlorine can cause this because Cl has an isotopic peak at about 37. So the molecular formula probably includes Cl.

Wait, but wait, the molecular weight is 156. Let me think about the options. Let me look at the options provided.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight. Carbon is 12, so 7*12=84. Hydrogen is 5, so 5. Chlorine is 35.5. Oxygen is 16*2=32. Total is 84 +5 +35.5 +32=156.5. Oh, the molecular ion is at 156. So maybe the exact mass is 156.0? Or perhaps the formula is C8H7ClO2? Wait, no, benzaldehyde is C7H6O, with a Cl adding 35.5. So 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would be C7H5ClO2, which is 7*(12) =84, 5*(1)=5, 35.5, 2*(16)=32. Total 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5+32=156.5. So the molecular ion is at 156, but the actual molecular weight is around 156.5. So maybe the molecular ion is at m/z 156, and the chlorine is present. Alternatively, maybe the Cl is adding a 35 or 37? Wait, the other peak is at 158, which is 2 more than 156. So that suggests a molecule with Cl (since 37-35=2). So the molecular ion would be at 35Cl and the 37Cl would give 158. So the molecular formula likely has one
