Okay, so I've got this question about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think. I remember from physics that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes according to the refractive index. But wait, the glass is moving too. Oh, right, this is a scenario involving relative motion between the medium and the observer.

So the setup: A light beam is going through a glass with index n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, my initial thought is that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n. So normally, v_light = c/n. But since the medium (glass) is moving, does that affect the observed speed? I think this is a case where we need to apply the velocity addition formulas from special relativity, but wait, this is a glass medium, which is not a vacuum. Hmm, how does that work?

Wait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about frames of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. From the lab's perspective, the glass is moving. So how does the light's speed in the glass appear to the lab observer?

Wait, but wait. The speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n in the glass's rest frame. But when the glass is moving, do we just add the velocities? Like, in Newtonian mechanics, velocities add as v_light_lab = v_light_glass + v_glass. But wait
