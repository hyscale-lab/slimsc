Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that means there's an ester functional group in the molecule. The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let me break down what each of those signals corresponds to.

First, the aromatic-H: two signals. So the aromatic ring has two sets of protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, there are two substituents on the ring. In a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in para, meta, or ortho positions. Depending on that, the number of distinct aromatic protons can vary. But the NMR shows two signals, which suggests maybe two different types of aromatic protons.

Wait, but in a di-substituted benzene, the positions of substitution can lead to different NMR signals. For example, if the substituents are para, then there are two sets of aromatic protons: the two adjacent to each substituent (ortho) and the two opposite (para). Wait, noâ€”if the substituents are in para positions, then the aromatic ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think: if substituents are para, the ring would be symmetric. So the two substituents are across from each other. Then, the aromatic hydrogens would be in two groups: the two next to each substituent and the two across. So that would give two signals for the aromatic protons. Yeah, that makes sense. So that would explain the two signals.

Then, the NMR shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, like in an alkene. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Wait, but in a vinyl group, each proton is coupled with the other. So for a trans double bond, the coupling is usually a doublet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a substituent on the aromatic ring, like an ester group attached with a vinyl group.

Wait, the compound has an ester group. Ester groups are usually O-CO-O. So maybe the structure is something like an aromatic ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester. For example, the substituents could be an ester group and another group, maybe a vinyl group or something else.

But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl signals. Let me think: if there's a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-, but in the NMR, each proton would couple with each other. So each would be a doublet. But in the problem, one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. That's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester, like maybe an ester with a vinyl group attached, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituents on the ring are an ester group and another group that has vinyl protons. Let's think about a structure. For example, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR) and another is a vinyl group (like CH2CH2 or something else). Or wait, maybe the substituent is an alkoxy group connected to an ester, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring has two substituents that contribute to the vinyl protons. For instance, if one substituent is an ester and another is a group like CH2CH2O... Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, the NMR data says two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets (a doublet of a quartet) would imply that one proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Or perhaps it's a more complex coupling scenario. Maybe the vinyl group is adjacent to another group that has protons. For example, if the vinyl group is part of an ester side chain.

Let me think about the ester structure. An ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if one of the substituents on the benzene is an ester, like O-CO-R, and R could be a vinyl group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent.

Wait, the aromatic ring is 6-membered and di-substituted, so two substituents. Let's imagine one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-R, and the other substituent is something else, perhaps an alkyl group.

Wait, but then the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. So perhaps the ester group has a vinyl group attached. For example, maybe the ester is something like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group
