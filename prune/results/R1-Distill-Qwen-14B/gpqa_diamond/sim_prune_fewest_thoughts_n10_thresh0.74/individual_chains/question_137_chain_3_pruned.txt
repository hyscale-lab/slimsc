Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, probably similar in function but maybe with some differences in how they operate.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is about 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], with given values Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes. The options are A to D.

Wait, in cyclotrons, particles move in a magnetic field, and as they gain energy, their radius increases. The frequency of their revolution might depend on the magnetic field and their mass and charge. But how does the voltage come into play here? Oh right, the electric field from the voltage accelerates the particles each time they pass through the gap between the D-shaped electrodes.

Since it's a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage must be adjusted as the proton gains energy. The magnetic field strength probably stays the same, but the frequency ν(α) changes. Oh wait, in a cyclotron, the frequency of revolution is given by f = qB/(2πm). But wait, that's for a cyclotron where the frequency is fixed, so as particles gain energy, their orbit radius increases, but they still keep the same frequency because the magnetic field is fixed. But in a synchrocyclotron, I think the magnetic field is varied to keep the frequency matched, allowing for higher energies.

Wait, but in this problem, the initial kinetic energy is zero, and it's accelerated twice to reach 950 MeV. So maybe each acceleration step adds some energy. Or does the proton make multiple passes through the electric field, each time gaining some energy?

Alternatively, perhaps each revolution corresponds to being accelerated once. So each time the proton completes a revolution, it passes through the electric field, which is applied in a way that the phase of the voltage matches the particle's arrival time.

Wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The proton's motion is such that each time it comes to the gap, the voltage is at the right phase to accelerate it. So the phase must be matched so that when the proton arrives, the voltage is at its peak (or the right point) to push it.

In a cyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted as the particle's velocity increases, so that it's always in phase with the particle's motion. So the number of revolutions would be the number of times the proton goes around the magnet before it reaches the desired energy.

But how do I calculate that?

I think the key here is to find out how much energy the proton gains per revolution, and then see how many such steps are needed to reach 950 MeV.

Wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So it's accelerated twice, but it's injected with negligible kinetic energy. Hmm, maybe each acceleration step corresponds to a certain number of
