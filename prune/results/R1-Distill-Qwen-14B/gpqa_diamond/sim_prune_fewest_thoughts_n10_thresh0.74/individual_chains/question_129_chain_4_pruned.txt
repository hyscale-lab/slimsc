Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through the question carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. The problem gives a reaction scheme and some hints, and I have to choose from the options A to D. Let me break it down.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. Compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm. Let me think about each step and what these reactions might indicate.

Starting with compound A. The IR peak at 1750 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). So A is likely a ketone or maybe an ester, but given the reaction with HCN, which is a nucleophilic addition, I think it's a ketone. Because HCN typically adds to carbonyls.

So A is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation involves adding HCN across the carbonyl group, creating a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

So compound B would be a cyanohydrin of A. Then, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is usually a catalyst for hydrogenation. So the reduction of a cyanohydrinâ€”what's that look like?

Cyanohydrins have the structure R2C(OH)CN. When reduced (like with H2 and Pd), the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to an amine, but wait, H2 and Pd usually reduce nitriles to amines? Or maybe in this case, since it's a hydrogenation catalyst, perhaps the double bond is being hydrogenated. Wait, no, in a cyanohydrin, there's an alcohol and a nitrile. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the cyanohydrin has an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So the structure would be (R2C(OH)CN). When you reduce this, what happens? The nitrile group (CN) would typically reduce to an amine (CH2NH2?), but perhaps under hydrogenation, the nitrile converts to an amine, but wait, in hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine. Or maybe the ketone was converted into an alcohol in the cyanohydrin, and then perhaps the nitrile is reduced.

Alternatively, maybe the reduction is of the
