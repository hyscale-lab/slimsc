Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. Let me think about what I know about NMR and these compounds.

First, I remember that acetates are esters, so the structure is usually CH3CO-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. The substituents on the R group will determine the splitting patterns in the NMR.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling constant. For vinyl protons, J around 16 Hz is typical for trans coupling in alkenes. So this might be a proton on a double bond, possibly adjacent to another proton.

- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe a doublet of something else. Wait, the data says dq, which might be a doublet of quartets or a doublet with some splitting due to two neighboring protons. Hmm, maybe this is another vinyl proton?

Wait, typically in an acetate ester, the ester oxygen is connected to the propenyl or butenyl group. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc or CH2CH2CH2OAc? Wait, no, but for propenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc or maybe the double bond is in a different position.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but the substituents could be in different positions. Wait, but let me think about the structure of each option.

Cis-propenyl acetate would have the two substituents on the same side of the double bond. Trans would have them opposite. So the structure would be something like CH2CH(OAc)CH2, but wait no, propenyl is CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group.

So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but the butenyl would have four carbons: CH2CH2CH2CH2, but as a double bond, it would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but position matters.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals. The 7.0 ppm is probably a vinyl proton. The doublet with J=16 suggests it's coupled to one other proton. So maybe a trans coupling between two protons on a double bond.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2-OAc-CH2-CH2? No wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but that's not right. Let me clarify the structure. Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but in that structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the protons on C1 and C2 would be on the same or opposite sides.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible structures of the options.

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate. So the structure is CH2=C(OAc)-CH2? No, wait, no, the ester is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let's correct that.

Wait, no, the correct structure for propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure again. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3.

Wait, but then the NMR. The protons on the double bond would be C1 and C2. So in the trans configuration, the substituents on each carbon would be opposite. So for trans-propenyl acetate, the OAc is on C3, and the substituents on C1 and C2 would be in a trans arrangement.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16. That's a large coupling, which suggests a trans coupling. So maybe the two vinyl protons are trans, which would give a larger J.

But in the propenyl group, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc, with a double bond between the first two carbons. Wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So the two protons on the double bond are on C1 and C2. So in the cis case, the two methyl groups (from CH2) would be on the same side. But wait, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the CH2 is attached to the OAc. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right because it's an ester. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the coupling in the NMR.

The 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, d, J=16 Hz) could be a vinyl proton that's coupled to another proton. So maybe in a structure where each vinyl proton is coupled to one other. So in a trans arrangement, each proton would couple with the other on the adjacent carbon, giving a doublet.

Then the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets or something else. Wait, the description says 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). Hmm, dq might be a doublet of quadruplets or a doublet of something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets, but the notation here is dq, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons. For example, if a proton is next to two different types of protons, it might split into a doublet of something. Alternatively, maybe it's an AB system where each proton is coupled to the other, leading to a doublet.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible structures.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but in cis configuration. No, but wait, butenyl is four carbons, so butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc but the double bond could be in different positions.

Wait, but butenyl could have the double bond between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. Let me think. For butenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl acetate), with the double bond between C1 and C2. Alternatively, if the double bond is between C2 and C3, it would be CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc? No, wait, but that would be allyl group if the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The butenyl group can be either cis or trans, and the position of the double bond affects the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, no, butenyl implies a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure for butenyl acetate would have a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, making it CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But then the substituents would be on C1 and C2.

Wait, but the position of the substituents (like the OAc group) affects the coupling.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the number of protons in the NMR.

The data shows:

7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)

5.5 (1H, dq)

2.1 (3H, s) → This is likely the acetate methyl group (OAc's CH3), which is typically a singlet because it's next to an electronegative atom and has no neighboring protons.

1.6 (3H, d) → A triplet? Or a doublet. Wait, 1.6 ppm is usually around where CH2 or CH3 groups are, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. So maybe it's a CH2 group attached to oxygen, or a CH3 group attached to a CH2 group attached to oxygen.

Wait, in propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the CH2-OAc is attached to the double bond. So the CH2 would have two protons. But in the NMR, I see a singlet at 2.1 (3H, s) which is OAc, and a 1.6 (3H, d), which is probably the CH3 in the CH2 group. Wait, CH2 groups usually have two protons, but here it's 3H. Hmm, maybe it's a CH3 group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH3? No, that would be another structure. Wait, no, the ester is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So in propenyl acetate, R is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So the CH2 groups would be: the OAc is attached to the third carbon.

The CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have the following protons:

- On the double bond: the CH2=CH- would have two protons on each carbon, but wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has one proton each if it's CH2=CH-.

Wait, no, CH2=CHCH2-OAc: the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So that's OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second CH2. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Oh wait, that's possible. So the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, that's the same as OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3.

In that case, the structure would have the protons on C2 and C3. So, the protons on C2 and C3 would be on the double bond.

Now, in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm would be a doublet, which is a proton coupled to one other. So perhaps it's a trans coupling between the two protons on the double bond.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) would be another proton, perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the splitting patterns.

In an allylic position, the protons can split into multiple peaks due to coupling with adjacent vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is a proton that's next to the double bond. For example, in a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond, the protons can split into a quartet or a doublet of doublets.

Wait, but if the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would be the CH2-OAc. The CH2 would have two protons. But in the NMR, we have a 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), which seems like a single proton. That doesn't add up. So maybe the structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-OAc-CH2-CH2, but that's not possible because of the ester group.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH3. No, that would be ethyl acrylate or something, but the options are propenyl and butenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-O-CO-CH2CH3, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, let me think about the protons.

The 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz) → This is a vinyl proton. The coupling constant J=16 Hz suggests it's coupled to another proton on the same double bond, likely in a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) → Maybe this is a proton adjacent to the double bond, perhaps on a CH2 group. So, if there's a CH2 group next to the double bond, each proton in the CH2 would couple with the vinyl protons.

Wait, but in the structure CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the CH2-OAc is adjacent to the double bond. So, each proton on CH2-OAc would be adjacent to the double bond. So their NMR signals would be split by the vinyl protons.

So the CH2-OAc would have two protons, each of which is split by the vinyl protons.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is a single proton, which doesn't match because CH2 would have two protons. Hmm, maybe that's not the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-OAc-CH2-CH=CH2. No, that would be a longer chain, maybe butenyl.

Wait, the butenyl group would have four carbons. So if the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, then the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C4.

In that case, the double bond protons would be on C1 and C2. The 7.0 ppm would be one of those, and the 5.5 ppm would be a CH2 group next to the double bond.

Wait, but I'm not seeing that clearly. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH-OAc. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc. But that would be a butenyl group with the double bond between C2 and C3.

In that structure, the double bond is in the middle. The protons on C2 and C3 would be the vinyl protons.

In the cis case, the groups on C2 and C3 would be on the same side; trans would be opposite. So in the case of trans, the coupling between the two vinyl protons would be larger, J around 16 Hz.

So if the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, that's consistent with a trans coupling.

Then, the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) could be a proton adjacent to the double bond, perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, but the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have protons that are split by the vinyl protons. For example, in CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc, the CH2 next to the double bond (on the left) would have two protons, each split by the vinyl protons.

But the NMR data only shows one proton at 5.5 ppm. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc. No, that's not right because the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate). In that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3.

So the CH2-OAc is on the third carbon. The CH2 would have two protons. Those protons would be adjacent to the double bond, so they would be deshielded and split by the vinyl protons.

So each of these two protons (on CH2-OAc) would be split by the two vinyl protons. But in the NMR data, we have a 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). Which suggests only one proton. That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the other signals. The 2.1 ppm is a singlet, 3H. That's definitely the OAc methyl group. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, 3H. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So a CH3 group attached to a CH group, which is attached to something else. For example, a CH3-CH- group, where the CH is next to a double bond.

So if the structure has a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to a double bond. So for instance, the structure could be CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: look at the integration.

The data is: 7.0 (1H), 5.5 (1H), 2.1 (3H), 1.6 (3H). So the molecule has a total of 1+1+3+3 = 8 protons.

But wait, an acetate ester would have:

OAc (3H), plus the R group. Let's see, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, which has 5 H (each CH2 has 2 H, and CH has 1 H? No, CH2=CHCH2- has 2 +1 +2 = 5 H. Wait, no, CH2=CHCH2- has two CH2 groups and one CH. So, 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 H. But wait, the CH2=CH- part has two CH2 groups? No, CH2=CH- is one CH2 and one CH, so 2 +1 =3 H, and the third CH2 (from the R-O- group) adds 2 H. So 3 + 2 =5 H. Then, plus the OAc's 3 H makes 8 H. So the integration matches.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

In cis-propenyl, the substituents on the double bond are on the same side.

So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but the configuration (cis or trans) refers to the substituents on either side of the double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituents are the OAc group and the other CH2 group.

Wait, no. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the substituents on the double bond are a CH2CH2-OAc group on one end and a hydrogen on the other? Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the OAc on C1.

In this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the protons on C2 and C3 are the vinyl protons.

In the cis configuration, the substituents on C2 and C3 (like the OAc on C1 and the CH2 on C3) would be on the same side. In the trans, opposite.

So for cis-propenyl acetate, the two substituents (OAc and CH2) would be on the same side of the double bond.

In the NMR, the vinyl protons would couple with each other. For cis coupling, the J is smaller, like around 10-12 Hz. Trans would have J around 16 Hz.

So the 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) suggests a trans coupling between two vinyl protons. So this would be in a trans configuration. So the structure must have a trans double bond.

Now, considering the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). Let's say that's a proton adjacent to the double bond. So in the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH2 group next to the double bond (on the CH2-CH=... part) would have two protons. But the NMR shows only 1H at 5.5 ppm, which doesn't add up. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH=CH-CH22. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's not an acetate; wait, acetate is OAc-O-R, so R is CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, wait. Let me consider butenyl acetate.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl group with double bond between C1 and C2).

In the cis configuration, the substituents on C1 and C2 would be on the same side. The OAc is on C4.

The protons on the double bond (C1 and C2) would each have a substituent. In the cis case, the substituents (like CH2CH2-OAc on C2 and CH3 on C1?) would be on the same side.

Wait, but the protons on the double bond would be each coupled to each other with a cis or trans coupling.

In the cis case, the coupling would be smaller, around 10-12 Hz. But our data has J=16, which is more trans-like.

So if the J is 16 Hz, it's more likely a trans coupling, so the structure would be trans.

Looking at the options, the options with trans are B and D.

Option B is Trans-propenyl acetate.

Option D is Trans-butenyl acetate.

So, if the J=16 is trans coupling, then the structure is either B or D.

Now, looking at the other part of the NMR data: the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). Let's think about what this could be.

In the structure, after the double bond, perhaps there's a CH2 group or a CH group.

Wait, for propenyl acetate, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the CH2 group (OAc-O-CH2-) is adjacent to the double bond. Each of the two protons on CH2 would be split by the vinyl protons on the adjacent double bond.

So each of these two protons would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the two vinyl protons (each coupled with two protons), but wait, no—each vinyl proton is on adjacent carbon, so each CH2 proton would be split by the two vinyl protons, leading to a doublet of doublets, perhaps.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the 5.5 ppm is a proton that's adjacent to two different coupling partners.

Wait, in the propenyl structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH2 next to the double bond (CH=CH2) would have two protons. These would be next to the double bond, so each would couple with the two protons on the double bond. But I'm not sure how that would split the signal.

Alternatively, maybe the 5.5 ppm is a vinyl proton. But wait, the 7.0 ppm is already a vinyl proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH=CH-CH2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the number of signals.

In the NMR, there are four distinct signals: 7.0 (1H), 5.5 (1H), 2.1 (3H), 1.6 (3H).

The 7.0 is a vinyl proton.

The 5.5 is another proton, maybe an allylic proton.

The 2.1 is the OAc methyl.

The 1.6 is a CH3 group attached to a CH2, perhaps.

Wait, the 1.6 (3H, d) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH, which is attached to something else. So maybe a CH(CH2OAc)3? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. No, that's another structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures of each option and their expected NMR signals.

Let's evaluate each option.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (cis configuration). The double bond is between C2 and C3.

In this structure, the vinyl protons are on C2 and C3.

In the cis configuration, the substituents on C2 and C3 (e.g., OAc-O-CH2- on C2 and CH2 on C3) would be on the same side.

The protons on C2 and C3 would each couple with each other. Since it's cis, the coupling J would be around 10-12 Hz. But the NMR shows J=16, which is trans. So this option is unlikely.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. Structure same as above, but substituents on opposite sides. So J would be around 16 Hz, which matches the 7.0 ppm signal.

In this structure, the vinyl protons would be trans, leading to a larger J. The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) would be one proton, and the other would be perhaps a doublet elsewhere. Wait, but the data only shows one vinyl proton. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, in the data, there's only one proton at 7.0 ppm. That suggests only one proton in the vinyl group. So perhaps the structure is such that one of the vinyl protons is split into a doublet, while the other is split into a different pattern.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me consider the other possibilities.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (cis). The double bond is between C3 and C4.

In this structure, the vinyl protons are on C3 and C4.

In cis configuration, their coupling J would be smaller, around 10-12 Hz. But the data has J=16, so maybe not.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (trans). The vinyl protons would have a larger J, around 16 Hz.

In this case, the 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) would be one of the vinyl protons. The other would couple similarly.

Now, considering the other signals:

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) would be a proton adjacent to the double bond. For butenyl, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So the CH2 groups are on either side of the double bond.

The CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have their protons split by the vinyl protons.

So, the CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 part: the CH2 next to the double bond (on the CH2-CH= side) would have two protons. But the NMR shows only one proton at 5.5 ppm, so maybe this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that one of the CH2 groups is split into a certain pattern.

Wait, maybe the 5.5 ppm is a proton on the CH2 next to the double bond, which is split by the two adjacent vinyl protons. So each of these protons would be a doublet of doublets or something else.

But the data shows only 1H, so perhaps it's a CH group, not a CH2.

Wait, but the butenyl group would have four carbons, so perhaps it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. No, that would make it a pentenyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3.

In the trans configuration, the substituents on C2 and C3 (like OAc-O-CH and CH2-CH3) would be opposite.

In this structure, the vinyl protons are on C2 and C3. The 7.0 ppm would be one of them, and the other would appear elsewhere.

Wait, but the data has only one vinyl proton. That's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Another approach: the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a CH3 attached to a CH2 group, perhaps. So maybe the structure has a CH2-CH3 group.

Wait, but in the butenyl group, perhaps the structure is something like OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, which would have CH2 groups on either side of the double bond. But then, the CH2 groups would have protons that are adjacent to the double bond, leading to splitting.

But again, I'm not seeing how that would result in a single proton at 5.5.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not possible because it's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. Then, the CH3 would be at the end. The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) would be the CH3 attached to the double bond's adjacent CH.

So, structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3.

In this case, the vinyl protons would be on CH2 and CH (from CH=CH-CH3).

The CH=CH-CH3 would have a proton on the CH, which is attached to CH3.

So the protons on the double bond would be on the CH2 and CH.

In the trans configuration, the substituents (OAc-O-CH2- and CH3) would be on opposite sides.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) would be one of the vinyl protons, say the CH2 proton, which is trans to the CH3.

The other vinyl proton is on the CH group. Let's say the CH group's proton is at 5.5 ppm. But wait, CH groups have only one proton, so that would make sense.

So the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) would be the CH proton attached to CH3.

How would that split? The CH proton is adjacent to the double bond and perhaps coupled with the CH2 proton and the CH3.

Wait, the CH3 would be adjacent to the CH, so the CH proton would couple with the CH3's proton, but CH3 has three protons, which would cause a quartet or something else.

Wait, but the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). So maybe the CH proton is coupled with two different sets of protons.

Alternatively, the CH proton is coupled with the two vinyl protons (on the adjacent CH2 and itself?), but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH proton is adjacent to the CH2 group, which is itself split by the CH2-OAc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize.

The structure that fits the NMR data would have:

- A trans double bond (J=16 Hz).

- A CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the rest.

- A CH3 group as a singlet (OAc).

- A CH group with a doublet of quadruplets.

If the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (trans), then the vinyl protons would be on the CH2 and CH.

The CH2's proton (on the CH2-CH= part) would be trans to the CH3, so J=16 Hz.

The CH's proton (on the CH=CH3 part) would be coupled with the CH2's proton (J=16) and perhaps with the adjacent CH3 group's protons.

Wait, but the CH3 is attached to the CH, so the CH's proton would couple with the CH3's three protons, leading to a quartet.

Wait, but the data shows 5.5 ppm as a doublet of quadruplets. That would imply coupling with two different sets of protons.

Alternatively, maybe the CH's proton is coupled with the CH2's protons (two protons) and the adjacent CH3's protons (three protons).

Wait, that would lead to a more complex splitting, possibly a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is the CH2 group's proton, but that's a CH2, which has two protons.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the number of signals.

In the NMR, we have four signals. So the molecule must have four distinct proton environments.

In the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (trans), the environments would be:

1. OAc's methyl (singlet, 3H at 2.1 ppm).

2. The CH2 group next to the double bond (two protons, but they might split into a quartet or something else).

3. The CH group attached to the double bond and CH3 (one proton, perhaps as a doublet of quadruplets).

4. The CH3 at the end (1.6 ppm, doublet, as it's attached to the CH).

Wait, but in this structure, the CH2 group would have two protons. But the NMR data has a 5.5 ppm (1H), which suggests a single proton. So this structure doesn't fit.

Hmm... Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the diastereotopic protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two vinyl protons are not equivalent, leading to two separate signals.

But the data only shows one vinyl proton, which doesn't make sense. Unless one of them is split into a more complex pattern that's integrated as a single peak.

Wait, perhaps the data is presented as integration, but sometimes peaks can overlap. Hmm, but the data says 7.0 (1H), so it's only one proton.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH=CH2 (propenyl acetate). Then, the structure would be OAc-O-CH=CH2.

In this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on the double bond are OAc-O- on C1 and a CH2 group on C2.

In trans configuration, the substituents would be opposite, leading to a larger J.

So the vinyl protons would be on C1 and C2.

The C1 would have one proton, and C2 would have two protons. Wait, no, CH=CH2 would have two protons on C2.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Then, the double bond is between C2 and C3.

The vinyl protons would be on C2 and C3. The C2 would have two protons, and C3 would have one proton.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because CH=CH2 has one and two protons.

Wait, maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (butenyl acetate). But then the double bond is at the end.

In this case, the vinyl protons would be on C4 and C5. Wait, no, the butenyl group has four carbons, so the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not a double bond.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the 5.5 ppm is an allylic proton, which is adjacent to the double bond.

In the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would have two protons. These would be split by the vinyl protons.

Each of these protons would couple with the two vinyl protons, leading to a triplet of doublets or something else.

But the NMR shows a single proton at 5.5, so maybe this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's only one proton in the allylic position.

Wait, another thought: in the case of a trans double bond, the two vinyl protons would be on opposite sides, and the coupling would be larger. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet, so it's coupled to one proton. So perhaps each vinyl proton is only coupled to one other, leading to a doublet for each.

But the data shows only one vinyl proton's signal, suggesting that the other is either not present or perhaps integrated as a different peak.

Wait, but the data lists 7.0 (1H, d), 5.5 (1H, dq), etc. So the other protons must be elsewhere.

Perhaps the structure has more than two protons on the double bond, but that's not typical.

Wait, another approach: the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is probably a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is attached to something else.

In the structure OAc-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2. No, that’s not right.

Wait, maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that would be a longer chain.

In this case, the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have protons that are split by the vinyl protons.

But again, the NMR data doesn't fit.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it again.

The key points:

- The J=16 Hz indicates a trans coupling between two vinyl protons.

- The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) is another proton, possibly an allylic proton.

- The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a CH3 attached to a CH2.

Looking at the options, let's think about each:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Vinyl coupling would be cis, so J around 10-12, not 16. So probably not.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. So J=16 is correct. Now, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, trans.

In this structure, the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would have two protons. But the data has only one proton at 5.5. So unless those two protons are equivalent and appear as a singlet, which they wouldn't, this might not fit.

But wait, the CH2 protons would be split by the vinyl protons. So if the CH2 is adjacent to a double bond, each proton on CH2 would have coupling with the two vinyl protons.

But the data doesn't show two protons; it shows one at 5.5, which suggests maybe it's a different proton.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is split into a multiplet that looks like a doublet of quadruplets, but only one proton is present. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH=CH-CH2-CH3, trans.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on each end would be OAc-O-CH and CH2CH3.

In the trans configuration, the J would be around 16 Hz.

The vinyl protons would be on C2 and C3. The C2 has one proton, and C3 has two. Wait, no, CH=CH-CH2CH3 would have the C2 as CH and C3 as CH2.

So the C2 has one proton, and C3 has two. The C2 proton would be coupled with the C3's two protons, leading to a triplet or something else.

The C3's two protons would be coupled with the C2's proton and maybe with adjacent groups.

But I'm not sure.

The 5.5 ppm could be the C2 proton, which is coupled to the C3's two protons, making a triplet. But the data says it's a doublet of quadruplets, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3's two protons are split into a quartet due to coupling with the CH2CH3 group.

This is getting too complicated, and I'm probably not getting closer.

Another approach: look for the CH3 group at 1.6 ppm (3H, d). A doublet suggests it's attached to a CH that's next to another group.

So, the structure would have a CH3-CH-... group.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (trans). So the CH2 is next to the double bond.

But that doesn't explain the CH3 at 1.6.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2. Then the CH would have a CH2CH3 group attached, and the CH2 would be split into a certain pattern. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the options.

The correct answer is either Cis or Trans for propenyl or butenyl.

Given that the J=16 suggests trans, the options are B (Trans-propenyl) or D (Trans-butenyl).

Now, let's think about the number of peaks.

In trans-propenyl acetate (OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, trans), the structure would have:

- One proton on CH2 (but wait, it's CH2, so two protons), but in the NMR, the 5.5 is 1H.

Alternatively, perhaps in this structure, one of the vinyl protons is at 7.0, and the other is at a higher field, perhaps as a multiplet.

But the NMR data only shows one vinyl proton. So I'm not sure.

In trans-butenyl acetate (OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, trans), the structure would have:

- Two CH2 groups next to the double bond.

The vinyl protons would be on the CH=CH2 end. So two protons on the CH and one on the CH2?

Wait, no. CH2-CH=CH-CH2. Hmm, no, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the vinyl protons are on the CH=CH2 group. So the CH has one proton, and the CH2 has two.

But the NMR data has only one proton at 7.0, so perhaps the other is a triplet or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, trans.

In this case, the vinyl protons are on CH2 and CH, with the CH3 at the end.

The 7.0 ppm would be the CH2 proton, and the 5.5 would be the CH proton.

The CH3 at the end would be at 1.6 ppm, as a doublet (coupled with the CH proton).

The CH proton would be coupled with both the CH2 and the CH3. So it would split into a doublet of triplets or something else, which could match the dq description.

This seems plausible.

So, structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (trans).

In this case:

- The OAc's methyl is at 2.1 ppm (s, 3H).

- The CH2 group next to the double bond would have two protons, but perhaps these are split into a quartet.

- The CH=CH3 group: the CH2's proton is at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), coupled with the CH's proton.

The CH's proton is at 5.5 ppm (dq), coupled with the CH2's proton and the CH3's three protons.

The CH3 is at 1.6 ppm (d, as it's attached to the CH).

This structure fits all the NMR data.

So the correct option would be trans-butenyl acetate, which is option D.


To identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data:

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**  
   - This is a vinyl proton coupled to another proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), indicative of a **trans** configuration in a double bond.

2. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**  
   - This is likely an allylic proton (adjacent to the double bond) that is coupled to two different sets of protons, resulting in a doublet of quadruplets (dq).

3. **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**  
   - A singlet integrating for 3 protons, characteristic of the methyl group in the acetate ester (-OAc).

4. **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**  
   - A doublet integrating for 3 protons, likely a methyl group (CH3) attached to a CH group adjacent to the double bond.

### Analysis of the Options:
#### **Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate**  
- Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (double bond between C3 and C4, cis configuration).  
- In the cis configuration, the coupling constant (J) between the vinyl protons would be smaller (around 10-12 Hz), not 16 Hz.  
- This does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate**  
- Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (double bond between C2 and C3, trans configuration).  
- The trans configuration would produce a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), consistent with the 7.0 ppm signal.  
- However, the structure does not account for the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) signal, as the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond would produce more than one proton signal.  
- This does not fully match the NMR data.

#### **Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate**  
- Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (double bond between C2 and C3, cis configuration).  
- In the cis configuration, the coupling constant (J) between the vinyl protons would be smaller (around 10-12 Hz), not 16 Hz.  
- This does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate**  
- Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (double bond between C3 and C4, trans configuration).  
- The trans configuration would produce a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), consistent with the 7.0 ppm signal.  
- The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) signal corresponds to the allylic CH group adjacent to the double bond, which is coupled to the vinyl protons and the CH3 group.  
- The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) signal corresponds to the CH3 group attached to the CH group adjacent to the double bond.  
- This structure matches all the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data is consistent with **trans-butenyl acetate**. The trans configuration explains the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), and the structure accounts for all observed signals.
