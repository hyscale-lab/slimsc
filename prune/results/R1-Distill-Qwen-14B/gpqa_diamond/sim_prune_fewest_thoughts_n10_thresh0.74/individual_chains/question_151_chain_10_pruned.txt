Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that's a vector in three-dimensional space, right? I think in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a column vector, so that makes sense. Let me note that down. The vector is [-1, 2, 1] transposed, so it's a 3x1 matrix.

The observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So, looking at this matrix, it's a 3x3 Hermitian matrix, I think, since observables are represented by Hermitian operators. Let me check if it's symmetric. The first element is 0, and the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are 1/sqrt(2) each. Similarly, (2,3) and (3,2) are 1/sqrt(2). The diagonal elements are 0 except maybe the middle one, but wait, the second row has a 0 in the middle. So yes, it's symmetric, so it's Hermitian. Good.

The question is to find the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. Hmm, okay. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of matrix P, and see which one is 0. Then, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue in the state vector.

Wait, wait, but maybe I should approach this differently. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P is a projection operator, but I'm not sure. Let me think. So, for an observable, the eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So, I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them.

So, let's find the eigenvalues of P. To find eigenvalues, I have to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

The matrix P is:
Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So, the matrix P - λI is:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ]

I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. Let's write it out:

| -λ       1/√2        0      |
| 1/√2    -λ        1/√2    |
| 0        1/√2     -λ      |

To find the determinant, maybe I'll expand along the first row because it has a zero which might make it easier.

The determinant would be:

-λ * det of the minor matrix at (1,1) - (1/√2) * det of minor at (1,2) + 0 * det of minor at (1,3).

So, minor at (1,1) is the 2x2 matrix:
[-λ       1/√2]
[1/√2    -λ]

The determinant of that is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

Minor at (1,2) is:
[1/√2     1/√2]
[0        -λ  ]

The determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ / √2.

So putting it all together, determinant is:

-λ * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) + 0.

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ)/2.

Second term: -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2) because (√2 * √2) is 2, so 1/√2 * 1/√2 is 1/2. And the negatives: - (1/√2) times (-λ/√2) is positive λ/2.

So overall determinant equation:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Wait, adding the two terms: (λ/2 + λ/2) = λ.

So the equation is -λ³ + λ = 0.

Factor out a λ: λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0.

Which gives solutions λ = 0, and -λ² +1=0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the determinant calculation because I might have messed up signs.

Wait, the determinant expansion is:

= -λ * det(minor) + (1/√2) * (-1)^(1+2) * det(minor) + 0.

Wait, no, the cofactor expansion along the first row is:

sum_{j=1 to 3} (-1)^{1+j} * a_{1j} * M_{1j}

where M_{1j} is the minor.

So, a_{11} is -λ, j=1: (-1)^(1+1)=1, so term is 1*(-λ)*det(minor11).

a_{12} is 1/√2, j=2: (-1)^(1+2)=-1, so term is (-1)*(1/√2) * det(minor12).

So, determinant calculation:

= (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2) * (-1) * [ det(minor12) ]

Wait, minor12 is the submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed. So, minor12 is:

[1/√2, 1/√2]
[0, -λ]

So the determinant of that
