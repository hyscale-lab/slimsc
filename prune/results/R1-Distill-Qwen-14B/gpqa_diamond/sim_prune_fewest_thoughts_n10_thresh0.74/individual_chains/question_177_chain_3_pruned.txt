Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. Interesting, so both radius and mass are 1.5 times bigger for Star_1 compared to Star_2.

Then, when the astronomers did spectroscopy, they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, the peak wavelength is the same. That makes me think about blackbody radiation and Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, that would mean both stars have the same temperature? Because λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So same λ_max implies same T. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait—blackbody radiation is about the spectrum, so if they're radiating as black bodies, then yes, same peak wavelength implies same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm. Radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But in this case, how does radial velocity affect the observed luminosity? Oh, wait, the problem says that they computed the luminosity using black body radiation. So perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed flux, but here they're talking about the intrinsic luminosity. Or does the radial velocity affect the observed temperature?

Wait, no. The problem states that the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies. And the astronomers computed the luminosities. So maybe the radial velocity affects the observed flux, but the luminosity is the intrinsic brightness. Or perhaps the radial velocity is given for another reason, like Doppler shifting the spectral lines, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but the problem is about the luminosity ratio. Luminosity is intrinsic, so it doesn't depend on how fast they're moving towards us. So maybe the radial velocity doesn't directly affect the luminosity calculation. Hmm
