Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that two nucleons (so like protons or neutrons) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X. Particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The question is about which partial wave is not permitted when considering the conservation of angular momentum and parity, along with Pauli statistics.

Wait, wait. Pauli statistics require that certain quantum numbers add up in a certain way. The given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 modulo 2. Hmm, I think T is the isospin, S is the total spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So for the NN state, T should be equal to S plus L plus 1, all mod 2.

The final NN state has T=0. So let's plug that into the equation. 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Which implies that S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity. If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 translates to (2*0 +1)S (since S=0) with J=0? Wait, no. Wait, 1S0: S is 0, L is S? Or wait no, the term is written as (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 would mean S=0, L=0 (since S is the spin, L is the orbital). So J is 0. Because L=0 and S=0, so J=0.

Wait, but the problem states that the NN system is in a 1S0 state. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, and J=0.

They emit a particle X, so the final state is the NN state plus this X. So the NN state's quantum numbers (T, S, L) must satisfy the Pauli condition.

Let me think about the conservation laws. Since the process is emission, I suppose angular momentum and parity are conserved, but since X is emitted, perhaps we have to consider the angular momentum coupling.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0 (so L=0, S=0, J=0). The NN emits X, so perhaps the total angular momentum before and after must be the same. But wait, this is an emission, so maybe the initial angular momentum is the same as the sum of the final state's angular momenta. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the partial wave expansion, considering the emission as a transition between states.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is that the NN system is in a state with certain quantum numbers and emits X, so the total angular momentum and parity must be conserved.

Wait, the problem states that Pauli statistics require T= S + L + 1 mod 2. So for the final state, the NN has T, S, L such that T = S + L + 1 (mod 2). And in this problem, T=0.

So 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 â†’ S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

Now, the initial state is 1S0. So S_initial =0, L_initial=0. So the total angular momentum J_initial is 0.

After emission of X, the NN state will have some angular momentum and spin, and X will carry some angular momentum as well.

Wait, but how does the angular momentum conservation apply here? The emission of X would involve the NN system's angular momentum changing. But perhaps the total angular momentum is conserved, considering X's angular momentum. Let me think.

The initial state has J=0, so the total angular momentum after emission should also be J=0. So the sum of the
