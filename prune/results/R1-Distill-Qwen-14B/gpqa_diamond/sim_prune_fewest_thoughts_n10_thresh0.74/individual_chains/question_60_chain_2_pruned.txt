Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Let me read it again.

The question is about an astronaut from an alien civilization traveling to Earth at a speed very close to the speed of light. The spacecraft's speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old when they start the journey, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. The options given are A, B, C, D, with A suggesting the astronaut dies before reaching Earth, which I guess implies the trip takes longer than their lifetime. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years, but the astronaut is only 22 when they leave, so if the trip takes, say, 130 years from their perspective, they would die en route.

But wait, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. So from the astronaut's perspective, less time passes than from Earth's frame of reference. Hmm, or is it the other way around? I think it's that the moving clock (the astronaut's) runs slower from Earth's perspective. But in this case, we're looking at the astronaut's own time, so the proper time experienced by them.

The problem gives the spacecraft's speed as 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to c. So the time experienced by the astronaut should be less than the time observed from Earth.

Wait, but the question is about how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective. So I need to calculate the proper time the astronaut experiences.

But wait, what's the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth? I'm not sure. Let me think. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Wait, no, that's the Andromeda galaxy. Let me recall: the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away, right? Or is it more? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million light-years away. The LMC is much closer. I think it's about 160,000 light-years. So Earth is roughly 16
