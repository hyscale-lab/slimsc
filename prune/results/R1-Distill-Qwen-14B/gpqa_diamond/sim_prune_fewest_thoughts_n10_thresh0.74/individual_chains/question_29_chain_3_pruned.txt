Okay, so I have this genetics question here about barley and some mutations, and I need to figure out which mutant would eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. Let me try to break it down.

Hmm, the question says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has this anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. So the gene is split into exons which are coding regions, and introns which are non-coding and spliced out. The gene sequence given is for the intact gene, and then there are four mutants with changes in the first exon area.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound. That probably means the gene isn't functional anymore if the compound is not synthesized. So we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a loss-of-function mutation.

Looking at the sequences, all the mutants have changes in the beginning of the first exon. The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'. Let's see each mutant.

Mutant 1: The first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’. Comparing to the intact gene, let's see:

Original starts ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT... Wait, let me line them up.

Original: positions 1-4: ATG T
Mutant1: ATG T
Wait, maybe looking at the first exon, where the first part is, perhaps a substitution. Let me look for a change in the amino acids.

The first part is the beginning of the coding sequence. The first few codons are important, maybe.

Intact: The first codon is ATG which is methionine, the start. Then TTT is phenylalanine, next CTC is leucine, GCT is alanine, etc.

Mutant 1 has ATG TTC TAC GCT... So let's see:

ATG is same. TTC is phenylalanine, same as TTT. Then TAC is tyrosine, whereas original is CTC (leucine). So the second codon in the mutant is still phenylalanine, but the third codon is TAC (tyrosine) instead of CTC (leucine). So that's a substitution.

Is that a missense mutation? So maybe the amino acid changes. But whether that disrupts the function depends on where it is. If it's in a critical region, maybe the enzyme is nonfunctional.

Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’. Let's compare:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT... So let's break it down.

ATG is same. Then TTC (phenylalanine) instead of TTT (same amino acid as TTC is phenylalanine too, since TTT and TTC are both Phe). Then TAA is next. Wait, the original after TTT is CTC, which is the third codon. So in mutant2, the third codon is TAA. But wait, the original is CTC (third codon is CTC, which is leucine). So in mutant 2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon (TAA is one of the three: TAA, TAG, TGA). Oh wait, that's a big change. If the third codon is a stop, the protein would be truncated early. So that's a nonsense mutation. If the gene product is a protein, this would likely cause a nonfunctional protein, as the reading frame stops early.

So mutant2 might have a frameshift?
