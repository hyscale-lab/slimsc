Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to understand what's going on.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they produced a mixture of gases. These gases were passed through several tubes. The first tube had anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which I think is a drying agent. The second tube had a Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third had red-hot copper. 

The results were that the first and third tubes gained weight—3.60 grams each. The second tube's weight didn't change. Then, only 2.24 liters of gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A) 13, B) 19, C) 17, D) 15.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what gases are being produced when the salts A and B are heated. Since they're heated without air, maybe it's a decomposition reaction. The gases are then passed through these tubes, which probably react with certain components.

The first tube, with Mg(ClO4)2, increased by 3.60 grams. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent and can react with water. So, perhaps one of the gases is water vapor. The increase in weight would be due to the absorption of water. So, maybe 3.60 grams is the mass of H2O captured. Let me check the molar mass of H2O: H is about 1, O is 16, so H2O is 18 g/mol. So, 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol of H2O. So, the gas mixture contains 0.2 moles of water.

The third tube had red-hot copper. I remember that when gases pass over hot copper, they can react with it. For example, carbon monoxide (CO) reacts with copper to form CO2. The reaction is 2CO + Cu → CO2 + CuO. Alternatively, if there's sulfur dioxide, it might react, but the problem mentions CuO is formed, so maybe it's CO reacting. The tube increased by 0.80 grams. Wait, the mass increase in the third tube is due to the reaction of CO with O2 or something else. Wait, when CO is passed over hot copper, it's oxidized to CO2. So, the increase in mass is the mass of the product minus the reactant.

Wait, the mass increase would be the mass of oxygen added. Because CO reacting with Cu (maybe in the presence of O2?) to form CO2. Let me think. If the reaction is 2CO + O2 → 2CO2, but I don't know if there's O2 present. Alternatively, maybe it's just CO reacting with Cu to form CO2 and CuO.

Wait, but the copper is in the third tube, which is red-hot. So, maybe the gas is CO, which reacts to form CO2. Let's calculate the mass change.

Suppose x moles of CO pass through. The reaction would be:

2CO → 2CO2 (when heated?), but probably it's the reaction with O2. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, when CO is passed over hot copper, the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CO2 + CuO. So, for every 2 moles of CO, you get 1 mole of CO2 and 1 mole of CuO. The mass change for the system would be the mass of CuO formed minus the mass of CO that reacted.
