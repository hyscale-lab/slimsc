Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the setup is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When observed, the star's brightness changes periodically due to rotation, and this looks similar to an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking: what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl) relative to the star's radius (Rstar) to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do?

Hmm, so the key here is to compute the change in brightness (the signal) caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change when it transits.

Wait, but wait. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the hemisphere facing us, they would cause the star to appear slightly dimmer. But when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The brightness variation due to the spots would be a decrease when the spots are visible and an increase when not? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Since the spots are cooler, when they are on the visible side, the star's overall brightness would decrease. So the brightness would dip when spots are visible, and rise when the spots are on the far side. But wait, in the problem statement, the star's brightness variation is due to rotational modulation. So the spots being on one hemisphere would cause the star to be dimmer when that side is facing us. So the light curve would have a dip when the spots are in view.

But the problem says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet. So when a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the light, causing a dip in brightness. So the dip caused by the planet is a decrease in light proportional to the area blocked, assuming the star's brightness is uniform (or similar in temperature).

But the spots are not uniform, so their effect is a bit different. Let's think about how the spots affect the brightness.

The star's total brightness is what we observe. If part of the star is covered by spots, the observed flux (brightness) would be the sum of the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

The star's total flux (F_total) without spots would be F = 4πRstar² * σ * Teff^4.

But when the spots are present, the flux becomes:

F = (1 - filling factor) * F_unspotted + filling factor * F_spotted.

Wait, but the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So in this case, the filling factor is 20%, or 0.2. So 80% of the surface is normal, and 20% is spots.

The flux from the unspotted regions is σ * Teff^4 times their area. The flux from the spots is σ * (Teff - ΔT)^4 times their area. So the total flux is the sum.

Wait, but flux is power per unit area, so the total flux from the star is the
