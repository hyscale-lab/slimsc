Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. I need to identify the final product from the given options.

First, let's parse the NMR data. The 1H-NMR spectrum shows several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's a pretty high chemical shift. Aldehydic protons usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe this is an aldehyde group. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be in that region, but more likely an aldehyde here.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. That's probably aromatic. Maybe some para-substituted groups, because the coupling could be with two protons.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. Since it's a doublet, maybe it's part of a para-disubstituted benzene ring as well. Let me think: if I have two doublets in the aromatic region, maybe they're part of a di-substituted benzene ring in para positions. Alternatively, maybe they're part of a coupling between two different substituents.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad signals usually indicate some exchange or maybe coupling with multiple protons. But 2H as a singlet... Possibly an olefinic (double bond) proton, but if it's a singlet, maybe adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause a doublet, but the 'bs' suggests maybe it's not split due to something else, like being in a conjugated system or adjacent to an electronegative group.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet for 2H. This could be a methylene group next to an electronegative atom, like O. So maybe -OCH2- or something similar. The coupling (d) suggests two neighboring protons. So perhaps a CH2 connected to
