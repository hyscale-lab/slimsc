Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through each step.

So the question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The star has a radius 1.5 times the Sun's. The second planet is bigger, 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still causing both transit and occultation events.

Hmm, wait, what do I remember about transits and occultations? Transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, blocking some light. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked. For both to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that it sometimes is in front and sometimes behind the star from our viewing angle.

But more importantly, both events depend on the orbital period and the orbital size, I think. The transit and occultation depend on the orbital period relative to the star's rotation, but wait, no, the star is much larger, so maybe it's more about the orbital period being such that the alignment occurs.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says both planets are in the same orbital plane, so their orbits are aligned. So the second planet's orbital period must be such that it's in a position to both transit and be occulted by the star.

Wait, but how does the orbital period relate to these events? Oh, I remember that for a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be aligned with our line of sight. But this is already given, as both are in the same orbital plane, so that's not the issue.

But why would the orbital period affect the ability to transit and occult? Well, maybe because if the second planet is too far out, its orbital period is longer, so the time between transits is longer. But the question is about the maximum period before such events stop happening.

Wait, another approach. For a planet to transit, the planet's orbit must cross the star's disk as seen from Earth. The condition is that
