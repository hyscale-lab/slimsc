Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm. Let me read it carefully.

The question says four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system, and then choose the correct option from A to D. The given E is pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy levels are quantized.

Wait, each particle in a 1D infinite well has energy levels given by E_n = (n²)E, where E is that given value. So each n corresponds to a specific energy, with n being a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...).

But wait, these particles are identical fermions, right? Because they are spin-1/2, which makes them fermions. So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Since spin is 1/2, each particle can have two possible spin states: up or down. So for each n, two particles can occupy the same n, but with opposite spins.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the well is one-dimensional, the quantum numbers are only determined by n, right? So each particle must have a unique (n, spin) state.

So for four particles, I need to arrange them in the lowest possible energy states, considering that each level can hold two particles (since spin up and spin down are allowed).

Let me think about the ground state first. Ground state is the lowest energy configuration where the particles are in the lowest possible energy levels without violating the Pauli exclusion.

So for four particles:

The first level, n=1, can hold two particles (each with opposite spins). The next level, n=2, can hold two more. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, 1² is 1, 2² is 4. So 2*(1E) is 2E
