Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to it, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says the peaks of their spectra are at the same wavelength. Oh, right! That relates to the star's temperature. I think that's from Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law states that the wavelength where a black body emits most strongly is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So since λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T must be same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Are we considering any Doppler shifts due to their velocities? Because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm. Oh, that's a good point. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, which is a shorter wavelength, and if moving away, redshifted, longer wavelength. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe they have the same observed λ_max, but their actual temperatures are different because of their velocities.

Wait, let me think. Spectroscopy gives us the observed wavelength. If a star is moving towards us, its emitted wavelength would be shorter (blueshifted), so the observed λ_max would decrease. Conversely, if moving away, λ_max would
