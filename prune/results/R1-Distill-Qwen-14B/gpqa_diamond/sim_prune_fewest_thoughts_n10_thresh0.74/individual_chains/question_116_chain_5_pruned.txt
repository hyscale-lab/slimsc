Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says that Compound A has two signals in its proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that NMR signals can tell us about the structure. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these protons are probably from two equivalent CH3 groups, maybe adjacent to a CH2. Because a triplet often means coupling with two neighboring sets of equivalent protons. So like, if each CH3 has two neighboring CH2 groups, that might explain it. Wait, no, the triplet would come from coupling with two neighboring protons each. Oh wait, no, each CH3 is next to a CH2, which has two H's. So each CH3 would split into a triplet if they're next to a CH2. Wait, maybe it's the other way around. If a CH2 is next to another CH2, like in a chain, the splitting could be more.

Wait, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm for 6H. So that's two sets of three H's, each as a triplet. Or perhaps two CH3 groups. Because 6H divided by 2 groups would be 3 each. So each triplet has 3H. So maybe two CH3 groups each next to a CH2. Because each CH3 would be next to a CH2 group, which has two H's. So each CH3 would split into a triplet. But wait, the area is for 6H, so maybe two CH3 groups each as triplets. Let me think: a triplet is from two neighboring H's. So if a CH3 is next to a CH2 (which has two H's), the CH3 would be a triplet. Because each H in the CH2 is coupled to the CH3.

Similarly, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each H is split into four, which usually comes from coupling with three neighboring H's. So 4H as a quartet. So 4H comes from two CH2 groups, each next to another CH2. Because each CH2 next to another CH2 would have a quartet. For example
