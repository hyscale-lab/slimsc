Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. Alright, so the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, usually quantum states are represented as unit vectors, but this vector doesn't look normalized. Let me check: the sum of the squares of the elements is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, right, so the state isn't normalized. So the actual state would be the given vector divided by the square root of 6. So ψ = (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1)^T. That's important because when calculating probabilities, we'll use this normalized state.

The question mentions two observables, P and Q. The operator for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down as per the description. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), second is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third is (0, 1/√2, 0). Wait, actually, let me make sure I have that right. So:

P =
[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]
[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]

And Q is another matrix:

Q =
[1, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, -1]

So, the problem asks for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, and -1 when measuring Q, in that order (P first, then Q). 

But wait, no. The question says: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So first P is measured, then Q. So the probability we're looking for is the probability that when you first measure P and get 0, then measure Q and get -1. But wait, no, the question actually says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So, I think that's the probability of first measuring P and getting
