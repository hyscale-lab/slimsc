Alright, so I have this question about Maxwell’s equations in a hypothetical universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole. Hmm, I remember that in our real world, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. But in this scenario, they can have isolated poles, which would change some of Maxwell's equations.

Let me think about Maxwell's equations as I know them. There are four main ones. The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity, which deals with electric flux and charge. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which says the divergence of B is zero, implying no isolated magnetic charges. The third is Faraday's Law of induction, which involves the curl of E and changing magnetic fields. The fourth is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, involving the curl of B and currents, plus the displacement current.

In our universe, Gauss's Law for magnetism (the second equation) states that the divergence of B is zero. So if in this universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that would mean magnetic monopoles exist. So the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore because there are magnetic charges (like isolated N or S poles) contributing to the divergence.

So the second equation would change. What about the other equations? The first equation, Gauss's Law for electricity, deals with electric charges and isn't directly affected by the presence of magnetic monopoles. Faraday's Law (third equation) deals with how changing B fields create E fields. I think that would remain the same because it's about induction, not the source of the B field.

Ampère's Law (fourth equation) includes the displacement current, which is about how changing E fields create B fields. But if magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect Ampère's Law? I'm not sure. Wait, Ampère's Law deals with the curl of B being related to the current plus displacement current. If there are magnetic monopoles, does that change the current? Hmm, maybe not directly. Or wait, perhaps the Maxwell's correction term would still be the same, but the sources would change.

Wait, if there are magnetic charges, then the sources for B would be different. So the second equation (divergence of B) would now be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how the divergence of E is proportional to electric charge density in Gauss's Law for electricity. So that equation changes.

Which other equations are affected? The third equation, Faraday's Law, involves the curl of E, but I think that equation remains the same because it's about the changing B fields, not the sources of B. The fourth equation, Ampère's Law, which involves the curl of B, is about how B fields are generated by currents. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that change Ampère's Law? Not directly. Ampère's Law is about the B field generated by moving charges (currents) and displacement currents. So maybe only Gauss's Law for magnetism changes.

Wait, but wait. There's another possibility. If magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps there's a dual formulation where some of the other equations also change. Like, perhaps the curl of E would also be affected. Because in our universe, Faraday's Law says the curl of E is minus the time derivative of B. But if there are magnetic charges, maybe there's
