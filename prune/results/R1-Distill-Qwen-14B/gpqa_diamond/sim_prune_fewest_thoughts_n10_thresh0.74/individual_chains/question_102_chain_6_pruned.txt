Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up in the mice when they're crossed with SOX10-Cre. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it step by step.

First, let's break down what's given. There's a bicistronic vector, which means it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) under a single promoter. The vector uses loxP sites and IRES elements. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, but there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) between the ligand ORF and mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) between its ORF and eGFP.

Wait, so the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element. Oh right, IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor would be expressed after the ligand, but in a bicistronic construct, both are driven by the same promoter. Or wait, maybe the IRES is for the receptor, so the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES, which might be weaker or require something else.

But then, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So when Cre is present, it will recombine and remove the stop cassettes. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. So when Cre is introduced, like through the SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed, each with their fluorescent tags.

But the problem is that in the offspring, the green signal (eGFP) isn't observed under the confocal. So why isn't eGFP showing up?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the construct is in the same cell, maybe autocrine? Not sure how that would affect expression. But in this case, the issue is whether the eGFP is expressed, not whether the ligand-receptor is working. So maybe this is about expression, not function.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. Hmm, eGFP is a fluorescent protein, so if the receptor-eGFP isn't getting to the cell surface, maybe it's retained in the ER or Golgi. But the question says they used antibodies for the overexpressed proteins in Western blot. So if the proteins are expressed, the Western should show bands. But wait, the Western uses total proteins, and they're loading based on actin. So if the proteins are expressed, the antibodies should detect them. If the eGFP isn't expressed, maybe the Western would show the receptor but not eGFP.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I believe. So the Cre should recombine the lox sites. So in the construct, the loxP site is before the ligand, and the lox2272 is after the receptor? Or wait, the setup is that the ligand is first, then stop cassette, then mCherry. The receptor is after the IRES, with its own stop cassette before eGFP.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So the layout is probably Ligand-ORF with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between it and mCherry, and for the receptor, it's after an IRES, and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP.

So when Cre is introduced, which recognizes loxP sites, it should delete the stop cassettes. So the ligand ORF would be expressed, followed by mCherry? Wait, no, the stop cassette is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So when Cre is present, it deletes the stop, so ligand and mCherry are in frame. Similarly, for the receptor, the lox2272 is recognized by a different recombinaseâ€”wait, no, I think loxP and lox2272 are different sites. So the Cre would only cut the loxP sites, not lox2272. Oh, wait, but the question says the vector is a lox-Cre vector, so maybe both stop cassettes are between lox sites that Cre can recognize. Or maybe one is loxP and the other is lox2272, which Cre can't process. Oh, right, lox2272 is a variant that is only recognized by Cre in the presence of certain conditions, but I think loxP and lox2272 are different. So if the stop cassette between the ligand and mCherry is loxP-stop-loxP, then Cre would delete that, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed in the same transcript. But the stop between receptor and eGFP is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so that would remain, so the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Wait, but the vector is a lox-Cre vector, so perhaps both are loxP. Or maybe the other is a different recognition site.

Wait, the question says: between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Between receptor and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is introduced, which recognizes loxP sites, it would delete the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, allowing the ligand ORF and mCherry to be together. But the lox2272 cassette wouldn't be affected by Cre, since Cre doesn't cut lox2272. So the receptor ORF would still have the stop cassette, and the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop cassette isn't being removed. Therefore, the mice crossed with SOX10-Cre would express mCherry but
