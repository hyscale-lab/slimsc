Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions using two unknown compounds, A and B. Each was treated with a different reducing agent. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the first reaction gives (R), the second gives (S). So A + LiBH4 with H+ gives R, and B + BH3 with H+ gives S.

The options are about what A and B are. The options are all about whether A and B are S or R configurations of a certain compound. Let me think about what's going on here.

So, starting materials are being reduced by different reagents. I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both borohydride reducing agents, but they have different strengths. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3, I think. Wait, no, wait. Actually, BH3 is a milder reducing agent. Let me get that right. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can reduce more things. BH3 is usually used for reductions that are more selective, like in the reduction of esters or ketones without going further.

Wait, but in this case, what's being reduced? The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That
