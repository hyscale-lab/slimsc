Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to analyze the given spectroscopic data to figure out what Compound X is. The data includes an IR spectrum and a 1H NMR spectrum.

Looking at the IR data: peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which suggests an -OH stretch, maybe a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Also, there's a peak at around 1610 cm-1, which could be from an aromatic ring (C=C stretch), and 1450 cm-1, perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let me break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is characteristic of an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. So there must be a carboxylic acid group here.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This looks like two sets of protons in an aromatic ring, probably para-substituted. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents, each with two equivalent protons on either side. Like a para-substituted benzene, maybe with a substituent in the para position and another group attached.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet around 3 ppm, which suggests maybe a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Or perhaps a methylene adjacent to something else. Hmm.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, integrating to 2H, perhaps a CH2 group next to another CH or something else.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet, which is typical for a methyl group attached to something, like a CH group. Maybe a geminal or adjacent group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet with 3H, which is likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, like an ethyl or propyl group.

Putting this together, the structure likely has a benzene ring with substituents. The IR suggests a carboxylic acid group. The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which fits that. So maybe a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR aromatic protons: 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. For a para-substituted benzene, the two protons on each substituent would be as doublets. Wait, if the substituent is a methyl group, like in toluic acid, but that's ortho, meta, para. Wait, but if the substituent is a larger group, say a carbonyl, maybe the coupling would change. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitro group, but the IR doesn't show a peak around 1520 for that, so maybe not.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is strong for a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would make sense because carboxylic acids have a carbonyl (around 1700 cm-1) and an -OH. So the structure is likely something like a substituted benzoic acid.

The benzoic acid would have the -COOH group and a substituent on the benzene. From the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d) and 7.2 (d). So perhaps the substituent is at the para position relative to the COOH group. That would make it a para-substituted benzoic acid.

But wait, the other NMR signals are more complex. Let's think: the 2.9 ppm (
