Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work it out.

Alright, the question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are from 10^59 to 10^66 J/K.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is something like S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, maybe the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p²), where l_p is the Planck length, but I'm not entirely sure about the constants. Let's think again.

The Bekenstein-Hawking formula says the entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon. The exact equation is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k), where k is Boltzmann's constant. Alternatively, I've also seen it written as S = (A)/(4 l_p²), where l_p is the Planck length, because l_p² = ħ G / c³. So maybe I can compute the area first.

But to compute the area, I need the radius of the event horizon. The event horizon radius R is given by R = 2 G M / c², where M is the mass of the black hole. So I can find R if I can find M.

Wait, but I don't have M directly. What do I have? The angular size θ and the distance d. Oh, right! The angular size relates to the actual size (R) through the formula θ (in radians) ≈ R / d. Because for small angles, the tangent of θ is approximately equal to R/d.

So first, I need to convert θ from degrees to radians. θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let's compute that.

1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians (because π is about 3.1
