Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a certain reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also called the degree of unsaturation, is a way to count the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 5. Oh wait, wait, let me think again. The name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, right? Because the numbering would start such that the double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, at carbon 2, there's a formyl group (which is CHO). And at carbon 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is CH2=CH2, but wait, no. Wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So the substituent at position 5 is a vinyl group, meaning it's attached as CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the structure would be CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, substituents: at position 2, a CHO group. At position 5, a CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. The substituent is vinyl, which is CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So the substituent is CH2CH2? No, wait, CH2-CH2 is ethyl, but vinyl is CH2=CH-.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure of the starting compound: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). So, the structure would be a six-membered ring, with double
