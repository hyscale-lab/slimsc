Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I think that's a vector, right? Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state is a vector in a Hilbert space. So the state is ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The observable is represented by the matrix operator P. Let me write down what P looks like. The first row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. The second row is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. So P is a 3x3 matrix.

The question is about finding the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Wait, but what's the eigenvalue we're interested in here? The problem says the measurement yields 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this by finding the expectation value or something else. Oh wait, no, the probability is the squared norm of the projection of ψ onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

So the steps I need to follow are:

1. Find the eigenvalues of operator P.
2. Identify which eigenvalue is 0.
3. Find the corresponding eigenvectors for that eigenvalue.
4. Compute the projection of the state vector ψ onto each of these eigenvectors.
5. Sum the squares of the absolute values of these projections to get the total probability.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to compute the matrix P multiplied by the state vector ψ and see what the components are, but wait, no, that's more for expectation values. For probability, I think the eigenvalue approach is correct.

Wait, but maybe I can think of the observable P as a projection operator. Because the given matrix P has elements that are 0 and 1/sqrt(2), which look like parts of a projection matrix. Let me check.

A projection matrix typically has elements that are either 0 or 1, or maybe 1/sqrt(n) for normalization. Wait, let's think about the structure of P.

Looking at P:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Hmm, this seems like a symmetric matrix, which is good because observables are Hermitian. So P is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P. The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

But that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix has some symmetry that I can exploit. Let me think about how the rows and columns are structured. The first and third rows are the same except for the middle element. Wait, no, first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], third is same. Second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2].

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to write out the matrix:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

So, let me compute the trace of P. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

Now, what about the determinant? Not sure, but perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by noticing the structure.

Alternatively, maybe try to guess an eigenvector. Let's see.

Suppose I take a vector where all components are the same, say [a, a, a].

Multiply P by this vector:

P * [a, a, a]^T = 

First element: 0*a + (1/√2)*a + 0*a = (1/√2) a.
Second element: (1/√2)*a + 0*a + (1/√2)*a = (2/√2) a = sqrt(2) a.
Third element: 0*a + (1/√2)*a + 0*a = (1/√2) a.

So the resulting vector is [1/√2 a, sqrt(2) a, 1/√2 a]^T.

If this is an eigenvector, then [1/√2 a, sqrt(2) a, 1/√2 a] = λ [a, a, a].

So:

1/√2 a = λ a → λ = 1/√2.

sqrt(2) a = λ a → λ= sqrt(2).

Which is a contradiction, so this vector isn't an eigenvector. So maybe that approach didn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps try a vector where the first and third components are the same, and the second is different.

Let me try [1, 0, 1]^T.

Multiply by P:

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1 = 0.
Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 = (2/√2) = sqrt(2).
Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1 = 0.

So resulting vector is [0, sqrt(2), 0]^T. Hmm, does this equal λ [1,0,1]^T? Let's see.

So 0 = λ *1 → λ=0.

sqrt(2) = λ *0 → 0.

0=λ *1 → λ=0.

But λ can't be both 0 and sqrt(2). So no, this is not an eigenvector.

Hmm, maybe trying another approach. Let's consider that the matrix P is symmetric and maybe has some symmetry in its eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the trace and the determinant to find the possible eigenvalues.

The trace is 0, as I said.

The determinant of P is the product of its eigenvalues. Let me compute the determinant.

Compute det(P):

|0   1/√2   0|
|1/√2 0   1/√2|
|0   1/√2   0|

Calculating the determinant:

It's a 3x3 matrix, so I'll expand along the first row.

0 * minor - (1/√2) * minor + 0 * minor.

So only the second term contributes.

The minor for the element (1,2) which is 1/√2 is the determinant of the submatrix:

[1/√2 1/√2
0     0   ]

Wait, no, wait. When you remove row 1 and column 2, the minor matrix is:

Row 2 and 3, column 1 and 3.

So the minor matrix is:

[1/√2 1/√2 ]
[0     0    ]

Wait, no, the minor is the matrix after removing row 1 and column 2.

So for element (1,2) = 1/√2, the minor is the determinant of:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So the minor matrix is:

[1/√2   1/√2 ]
[0       0    ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it correctly.

After removing row 1 and column 2, the remaining elements are:

Row 2: [1/√2 (column 1), 1/√2 (column 3)]
Row 3: [0 (column1), 0 (column3)].

Wait, no, original matrix after removing row 1 and column 2 is:

Row 2: [1/√2 (column 1), 1/√2 (column 3)]
Row 3: [0 (column1), 0 (column3)].

So the minor matrix is:

[1/√2   1/√2
 0       0 ]

The determinant of this 2x2 matrix is (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(0) = 0.

So the determinant of P is (1/√2) * (-1)^{1+2} * 0 = (1/√2)*(-1)*0 = 0.

So determinant is zero, meaning that one of the eigenvalues is zero.

So the eigenvalues are λ1, λ2, 0. Sum of eigenvalues is zero, so λ1 + λ2 + 0 =0 → λ1 + λ2=0. So λ2 = -λ1.

Also, the trace is zero.

Now, to find the other eigenvalues, perhaps think about other eigenvectors.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to assume that the matrix has two eigenvalues: some λ and -λ, and zero.

Alternatively, let me compute the square of P. Maybe that can give me some insight.

Compute P squared.

P is:

Row1: [0, a, 0], where a=1/√2.

Row2: [a, 0, a].

Row3: [0, a, 0].

So compute P^2.

Let me compute each element:

Element (1,1) of P^2 is sum of Row1 of P multiplied by Column1 of P.

Row1: 0, a, 0.

Column1: 0, a, 0.

So 0*0 + a * a + 0*0 = a² = (1/2).

Similarly, element (1,2) is sum of Row1 * Column2.

Column2: a, 0, a.

So 0*a + a*0 +0*a =0.

Wait, no. Wait, Column2 of P is [a, 0, a]^T.

So Row1 of P is [0, a, 0], so (0)(a) + (a)(0) + (0)(a) )= 0.

Similarly, element (1,3) would be Row1 * Column3.

Column3 of P is [0, a, 0].

So 0*0 + a*a +0*0 = a²=1/2.

Wait, but looking at the calculation, maybe I should be more precise.

Wait, element (i,j) of P^2 is the dot product of row i of P and column j of P.

So (1,1): row1 · col1 = 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a² = 1/2.

(1,2): row1 · col2.

col2 is [a, 0, a]^T. So 0*a + a*0 +0*a = 0.

Similarly, (1,3): row1 · col3.

col3 is [0, a, 0]^T.

0*0 + a*a +0*0 = a²=1/2.

Now, row2 of P is [a, 0, a].

Compute P^2 element (2,1): row2 · col1.

col1 is [0, a, 0]^T.

a*0 +0*a +a*0 =0.

(2,2): row2 · col2.

a*a +0*0 +a*a = a² + a² = 2a² = 2*(1/2)=1.

(2,3): row2 · col3.

a*0 +0*a +a*0=0.

Row3 of P is [0, a, 0].

(3,1): row3 · col1.

0*0 +a*a +0*0= a²=1/2.

(3,2): row3 · col2.

0*a +a*0 +0*a=0.

(3,3): row3 · col3.

0*0 +a*a +0*0= a²=1/2.

So putting it all together, P^2 is:

[ [1/2, 0, 1/2 ],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Hmm, interesting. Now, what's the trace of P^2? The sum of the diagonal elements is 1/2 +1 +1/2 = 2.

Wait, but the trace of P^2 is equal to the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues of P. Because for any matrix, trace of M^2 is sum λ_i², where λ_i are the eigenvalues.

So the sum of (λ_i)^2 for i=1,2,3 is equal to trace(P^2) = 2.

We know that one of the eigenvalues is zero, so sum of squares is 0 + λ1² + λ2² = 2.

But earlier, we had that λ1 + λ2 =0, because the trace of P is zero.

So λ2 = -λ1.

So substituting, (λ1)^2 + (λ2)^2 = 2 → λ1² + (λ1)^2 = 2 → 2λ1² =2 → λ1²=1 → λ1= ±1.

Since λ2 = -λ1, if λ1=1, λ2=-1; if λ1=-1, λ2=1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, 0.

Wait, that makes sense. So P has eigenvalues 1, -1, and 0.

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, and 0.

The question is about the probability of measuring 0.

So now, the next step is to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then calculate the projection of the state vector ψ onto this eigenvector.

Alternatively, since P is a projection operator, maybe the eigenspace for 0 has a certain structure. Wait, but P is not a projection operator because P² isn't equal to P. Let me check.

Earlier, I computed P squared as a matrix with 1/2 in (1,1) and (1,3), etc. So P squared is not equal to P, so P is not a projection operator.

Hmm. So back to finding the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So, to find the eigenvectors for λ=0, we solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So we need to find vectors v such that P v = 0.

Let me set up the equations.

P v = 0.

P is as defined earlier.

So the system of equations is:

(0)(v1) + (1/√2)(v2) + 0*(v3) = 0 → v2 = 0.

(1/√2)(v1) + 0*(v2) + (1/√2)(v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

(0)(v1) + (1/√2)(v2) + 0*(v3) = 0 → v2=0.

So from the first equation, v2=0.

From the third equation, same thing, v2=0.

From the second equation, v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are all vectors where v2=0 and v3 = -v1.

So any vector of the form [a, 0, -a]^T, where a is any scalar. Let's write it as a = a [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, to find the probability, we need to compute the projection of ψ onto this eigenspace.

The state vector is ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

We can represent the eigenvector as v = [1, 0, -1]^T.

We need to compute the inner product of ψ and v, normalized by the norm of v.

The projection amplitude is (ψ · v) / (||v||).

Wait, the formula is: probability = |<v|ψ>|^2 / ||v||^2. Alternatively, since v is normalized, it's just |<v|ψ>|^2.

Wait, no, wait. The probability is |<e|ψ>|^2, where e is a unit eigenvector.

In this case, the eigenvector is [1,0,-1]^T, but is it normalized?

Compute the norm of v: sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).

So the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the inner product <e|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] · [-1, 2, 1].

Compute the dot product:

1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.

Multiply by (1/sqrt(2)).

So <e|ψ> = (-2) / sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this.

Absolute value squared: (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

So probability is 2/(sqrt(2))^2? Wait, wait, no. Wait, <e|ψ> is (-2/sqrt(2)).

The absolute value squared is (2/sqrt(2))^2 = ( (2)^2 )/( (sqrt(2))^2 ) ) = 4/2 =2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the probability can't be greater than 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, because the state vector ψ might not be normalized. Let me check.

The state vector ψ is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6).

So ψ is not normalized. The state vector should be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually taken to be unit vectors. Unless it's given otherwise, perhaps the given vector is not normalized.

Wait, the problem statement says the state is given by that column matrix. It doesn't mention normalization. So in this problem, I need to take into account the norm of ψ.

Because the probabilities are calculated with respect to the norm of the state vector. So, the actual probability would be the squared norm of the projection, divided by the squared norm of ψ.

Wait, right. So to compute the probability correctly, since ψ is not a unit vector, I have to normalize it.

So, the correct formula is: probability = (| <e|ψ> |^2) / (||ψ||^2).

Because when the state is not normalized, the probabilities are scaled by the square of the state's norm.

So, let's recalculate.

The inner product <e|ψ> is (-2)/sqrt(2) as before. So |<e|ψ>|^2 is (4)/(2) )=2.

The norm squared of ψ is 6.

So probability is 2 /6 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

So the answer should be C.


The state of the system is given as the vector \( \psi = [-1, 2, 1]^T \), and the observable is represented by the matrix \( P \), which is a \( 3 \times 3 \) symmetric matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0. In quantum mechanics, the probability of obtaining a specific eigenvalue (in this case, 0) is determined by the projection of the state vector \( \psi \) onto the eigenspace corresponding to that eigenvalue.

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). By analyzing the structure of \( P \), it can be shown that the eigenvalues are \( 1, -1, \) and \( 0 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvectors satisfy \( P v = 0 \). Solving the system of equations derived from \( P v = 0 \), the eigenvectors are of the form \( v = [a, 0, -a]^T \), where \( a \) is a scalar. The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
e = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [1, 0, -1]^T.
\]

### Step 3: Projection of \( \psi \) onto \( e \)
The projection amplitude is given by:

\[
\langle e | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [1, 0, -1] \cdot [-1, 2, 1] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (-1) + 0 + (-1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this projection:

\[
P_{\text{measured}} = \left| \langle e | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = 2.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize \( \psi \)
The norm of \( \psi \) is:

\[
\|\psi\|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.
\]

The normalized probability is:

\[
P_{\text{measured}} = \frac{P_{\text{measured}}}{\|\psi\|^2} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
