Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several stages. The main one is the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has different branches. I think the pp-I branch is the main contributor, and then there are others like pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, right, the pp-III branch is part of the cycle that produces carbon, which then goes into the CNO cycle as well. But the question specifically says the pp-III branch stopped.

So, if the pp-III branch stops about 8.5 minutes ago, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the neutrino flux would have already reached us since the neutrinos would have been emitted before that time. Therefore, the current flux is based on the state 8.5 minutes ago.

Neutrinos are produced in various processes in the Sun. The main ones are the electron neutrinos from the pp chain and the CNO cycle. Oh, but wait, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping. So does that affect the neutrino production?

The pp-III branch involves the reaction where two protons combine with a helium-4 nucleus (alpha particle) to form boron-8, which then decays into beryllium-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Wait, no,
