Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200Â°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases formed. Then this gas was passed through three tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, tube 3 gained 0.80 grams, and tube 2 didn't change. After that, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I think I need to figure out what the salts A and B are, based on the reactions that happened when they were heated.

First, when salts are heated, they can decompose into gases. The gases then passed through these tubes. Let's think about each tube and what it does.

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant and can trap water vapor. So when a gas is passed through it, if the gas contains water, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, increasing the tube's weight. So the weight gain here is 3.60 grams, which is likely the mass of water absorbed. So the gas mixture must have contained water vapor (H2O).

But wait, the problem says the gas mixture was passed through tube 1, and the weight increased by 3.60 g. So the amount of H2O in the gas is 3.60 g.

Next, tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas passed through a solution of Ca(OH)2 and the weight didn't change, that suggests that the gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2. What gases don't react with Ca(OH)2? Well, CO2 would react to form CaCO3, which would increase the weight. But since the weight didn't change, perhaps the gas didn't have CO2. Or maybe it did, but it was in a different form. Alternatively, maybe the gas didn't contain CO2 or other acidic gases that would react with Ca(OH)2.

Wait, but wait a second. The gas passed through an anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 first, which would remove water. Then, the remaining gas went through the Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas didn't cause any reaction (no weight change), it suggests that there was no water (already removed) and perhaps no CO2. Maybe the gas was something like NH3 or HCl? But wait, NH3 would react with Ca(OH)2, so that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the gas was just nitrogen or some inert gas, but that doesn't make sense in the context of heating salts.

Wait, maybe the gas that passed through tube 2 was a non-reactive gas, like nitrogen or maybe just a noble gas. But I'm not sure yet. I'll come back to this.

Then, tube 3: red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. So, the gas that passed through tube 3 must have reacted with copper. What gases react with copper when heated? Hydrogen comes to mind, but I think H2 would react with CuO, but wait, in this case, the copper is in the tube, and the gas is passed through. Wait, maybe it's a reaction where the gas is oxidizing the copper. Alternatively, perhaps the gas
