Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength! That's probably related to the black body radiation and Wien's Law. 

Wait, Wien's Law states that the wavelength at which the emission is maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. So lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If the lambda_max is the same for both stars, that means their temperatures are the same. Oh, right, because if lambda is same, T is same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Now, the next part says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Oh, radial velocity—that's the velocity along the line of sight. Wait, but how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, it shifts the wavelength we observe. But wait, Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, but I'm not sure if that affects the calculation of luminosity, because luminosity is intrinsic. But wait, the observed flux might be affected by velocity, but the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming black body. So I think the velocities might be a red herring, unless they're affecting the observed temperature or something.

Wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So maybe the radial velocities aren't directly affecting the computed luminosity, because when they calculate using black body formulas, they might be correcting for any Doppler shift in the observed spectrum. Or perhaps the velocities affect the observed flux, but the calculation of luminosity (intrinsic brightness) would require correcting for distance. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but let me get back to the main point. The luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same temperature, because lambda_max is same, then L is proportional to R².

So Star_1 has radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2 would be (R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1/L2 = 2.25. So the factor is about 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, D is ~2.23, which is close but not the same.

Wait, but why are the velocities given then? Because if the stars are moving, it might affect the observed flux. Oh, wait, the luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, not the observed flux. So when you calculate luminosity from observed data, you might have to account for distance, but if they're using black body radiation and have determined the temperature, perhaps the velocities aren't directly affecting the luminosity calculation here. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the radial velocities affect the observed temperature. Because if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, which would shift the peak wavelength. But in this case, Star_1 has 0 velocity, so its observed wavelength is as emitted. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but since we measured the peak wavelength for both stars and they are the same, any Doppler shift must have been accounted for. So perhaps the temperatures are the same as the emitted temperatures, not the observed ones. Or maybe not—this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The peak wavelengths observed are the same. So if Star_2 is moving, its emitted peak wavelength would have been shifted due to Doppler effect. So the observed lambda_max for Star_2 would be different from its emitted lambda_max. But in the problem, the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So perhaps the actual temperatures of the stars are the same, but Star_2's light is Doppler shifted.

Wait, that can't be because if a star is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is blueshifted (shorter), and if moving away, redshifted (longer). So in this case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving towards us, causing a blueshift. But since the observed lambda_max is same as Star_1, the actual emitted lambda_max of Star_2 must be longer? Because a blueshift would make the observed lambda_max shorter than emitted. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem accounts for the Doppler effect when determining the temperature. So the observed peak wavelength is the same, but the actual temperatures of the stars would be different unless the Doppler shifts are accounted for.

Wait, maybe I need to calculate the actual temperatures of the stars, considering their radial velocities. Because if a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted. So the observed lambda_max_obs = lambda_max_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta = v/c.

Wait, I think the Doppler formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is v/c. So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, beta is 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333. So sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ≈ sqrt( (0.997667)/(1.002333) ) ≈ sqrt(0.99537) ≈ 0.99768. So lambda_obs for Star_2 is lambda_emit * 0.99768.

But wait, the problem says that the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So for Star_1, lambda_max_obs = lambda_emit_1. For Star_2, lambda_max_obs = lambda_emit_2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ). And these are equal. So lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ).

But from Wien's Law, lambda_max is inversely proportional to T. So lambda_emit_1 = b / T1, lambda_emit_2 = b / T2. So (b/T1) = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ). So T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Hmm, so the temperatures are not the same. So earlier assumption that T1=T2 was wrong because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, so the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So the actual emission wavelengths are different. But then, when computing luminosity, which uses the actual emitted temperature, we need to account for that. Because the stars have different temperatures.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming the stars are black bodies. So perhaps they used the observed lambda_max to find the temperature, but that would be incorrect if there's a Doppler shift. Alternatively, they might have used the observed spectrum to correct for Doppler shift and determine the actual temperature.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.

The problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

But Star_1 has no radial velocity, so lambda_obs_1 = lambda_emit_1.

Star_2 has velocity v=700 km/s. So lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emit_2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta = v/c.

So, lambda_emit_2 = lambda_obs_2 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ) = lambda_obs_1 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But lambda_emit_1 = lambda_obs_1.

From Wien's law, lambda_emit = b / T, so T = b / lambda_emit.

Thus,

T1 = b / lambda_emit_1 = b / lambda_obs_1.

T2 = b / lambda_emit_2 = b / ( lambda_obs_1 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ) ) = (b lambda_obs_1 ) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ) / lambda_obs_1 ) )

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me recompute T2.

lambda_emit_2 = lambda_obs_1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So T2 = b / lambda_emit_2 = b / [ lambda_obs_1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ) ] 

But T1 = b / lambda_obs_1.

So T2 = T1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which simplifies to T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Because 1/(sqrt(a/b)) ) = sqrt(b/a).

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Hmm, that's the relationship between their temperatures.

So now, the luminosity L is 4πR²σT⁴. So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5.

T1 and T2 are related as T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1-beta)/(1+beta) )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( (1+beta)/(1-beta) )

Thus, (T1/T2)^4 = [ (1+beta)/(1-beta) ]^2

Putting it all together:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * [ (1+beta)/(1-beta) ]^2

Because (R1/R2)^2 is (1.5)^2, and (T1^4 / T2^4) is [ (1+beta)/(1-beta) ]^2.

So we have to compute this.

First, beta is v/c = 700 km/s divided by c (3e5 km/s) → 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So beta ≈ 0.02333.

Compute (1 + beta) = 1.02333.

(1 - beta) = 0.97667.

So (1+beta)/(1-beta) ≈ 1.02333 / 0.97667 ≈ let's calculate it.

1.02333 ÷ 0.97667 ≈ let's calculate:

0.97667 * 1.047 ≈ 1.02333? Let's see:

0.97667 * 1.047 = 0.97667 * 1 ≈ 0.97667, 0.97667 * 0.047 ≈ 0.046. Sum is ~1.02267. Close enough. So 1.047.

Wait, but more accurately, perhaps calculate it as:

(1.02333)/(0.97667) = approximately 1.047.

So (1+beta)/(1-beta) ≈ 1.047.

So [ (1+beta)/(1-beta) ]^2 ≈ (1.047)^2 ≈ approx 1.096.

Then, (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Multiply 2.25 by 1.096 → 2.25 * 1.096.

Let me compute 2.25 * 1 = 2.25, 2.25 * 0.096 = 0.216. So total is 2.25 + 0.216 = 2.466.

Wait, but wait, that's if the ratio is 1.047. But is that correct? Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute (1+beta) = 1 + 0.023333 = 1.023333.

(1-beta) = 0.976667.

Now, (1.023333)/(0.976667) = let me compute that exactly.

1.023333 divided by 0.976667.

Let me compute numerator and denominator in terms of fractions.

But perhaps better to compute it as:

Let me compute 1.023333 / 0.976667.

Approximating:

0.976667 is approximately 976667/1e6.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: compute 1.023333 / 0.976667.

Using calculator approximation:

Let me compute 1.023333 ÷ 0.976667 ≈ Let's use the exact division.

1.023333 / 0.976667 ≈ 1.0477.

So (1+beta)/(1-beta) ≈ 1.0477.

So squared is (1.0477)^2 ≈ 1.0477 * 1.0477.

Compute 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816.

But 1.0477 is a bit more. Let's compute 1.0477^2.

(1 + 0.0477)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0477 + (0.0477)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0954 + 0.00227 ≈ 1.09767.

So about 1.09767.

So [ (1+beta)/(1-beta) ]^2 ≈ 1.0977.

Then, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.0977 = 2.25 * 1.0977.

Compute 2.25 * 1.0977: 2 * 1.0977 = 2.1954, 0.25 * 1.0977 = 0.2744. Sum is 2.1954 + 0.2744 = 2.4698.

So approximately 2.47.

Wait, but the options given are all around 2.2-2.35. So none of the options are about 2.47. Hmm, this suggests I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I get the Doppler shift right? Because sometimes there are different Doppler formulas depending on approximation.

The Doppler effect for light is given by lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), correct? Or is it (1 + beta) in the denominator?

Wait, I think the exact Doppler shift formula for when the source is moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), but wait, no, that's when the source is moving towards us. Wait, no: when the source is moving towards us (v positive towards observer), the observed wavelength is shorter, so lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ). So yes, that part was correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the temperature ratio.

Wait, so T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which is the same as sqrt( ((1.023333)/(0.976667)) ) = sqrt(1.0477) ≈ 1.0235.

Wait, that's the ratio T1/T2.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (1.0235)^4.

Wait, that's different from earlier approach. Wait, earlier I thought that the (T1/T2)^4 was [ (1+beta)/(1-beta) ]^2, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Let me re-express:

T1 = b / lambda_emit_1.

T2 = b / lambda_emit_2.

But lambda_emit_2 = lambda_obs_2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Wait, no. Let me re-express.

Wait, lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emit_2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So lambda_emit_2 = lambda_obs_2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But lambda_obs_2 = lambda_obs_1, because the observed lambda for both stars is same.

So lambda_emit_2 = lambda_obs_1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Similarly, lambda_emit_1 = lambda_obs_1.

So the temperatures:

T1 = b / lambda_emit_1 = b / lambda_obs_1.

T2 = b / lambda_emit_2 = b / [ lambda_obs_1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ) ]

So T2 = [ b / lambda_obs_1 ] * [ 1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ) ]

Which is T2 = T1 * [ sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]

So T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Hence, T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So [T1 / T2]^4 = [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2.

Wait, that part was correct earlier.

So the ratio L1/L2 is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1^4 / T2^4 ) = (1.5)^2 * [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2.

Which as I calculated before gave me 2.25 * (1.0977) = ~2.47.

But none of the options are near that. The options are ~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35.

Hmm, so where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the radial velocity is 700 km/s but the direction is towards or away from us? Because the Doppler shift depends on the direction. If Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter, implying that its emitted wavelength is longer than observed. Wait, no. Let me think.

If a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is blueshifted (shorter than emitted). So if both stars have same observed wavelength, then Star_2's emitted wavelength must be longer than Star_1's. Because when you blueshift a longer wavelength, you get to the same observed wavelength as a star with no shift.

Wait, maybe that's the key. Let me think again.

Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Suppose it's moving towards us. So its observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But the observed wavelength is same as Star_1, which has lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

So lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs2 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

So lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which is bigger than lambda_emit1, because (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) is >1.

So T2 = b / lambda_emit2 = (b / lambda_emit1) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which is T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So the same conclusion as before.

So then L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2.

Wait, let's compute [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2.

Beta = 700e3 m/s / 3e8 m/s → 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e2 / 3e8 = 7/(3e5) ≈ 0.0023333.

So (1 + beta) = 1.0023333.

(1 - beta) = 0.9976667.

So (1.0023333/0.9976667) ≈ let's compute this.

Let me compute 1.0023333 divided by 0.9976667.

Let me compute 1.0023333 ÷ 0.9976667.

Approximating, 0.9976667 * 1.0047 ≈ about 1.0023333.

Because 0.9976667 * 1.0047 = 0.9976667 * (1 + 0.0047) = 0.9976667 + 0.9976667 * 0.0047 ≈ 0.9976667 + 0.0047 ≈ 1.0023667, which is a bit higher than 1.0023333, but close enough.

So (1+beta)/(1-beta) ≈ 1.00467.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.0023333 / 0.9976667.

Let me compute it as (1 + 0.0023333) / (1 - 0.0023333).

Which is (1 + a) / (1 - a), where a is 0.0023333.

Using Taylor expansion, this is approximately 1 + 2a + 2a² + ..., but perhaps it's easier to compute directly.

Compute 1.0023333 / 0.9976667.

Compute 0.9976667 * 1.00467 = ?

Wait, 0.9976667 * 1 = 0.9976667.

0.9976667 * 0.00467 ≈ 0.9976667 * 0.004 = 0.0039906668, and 0.9976667 * 0.00067 ≈ 0.0006686.

Sum is 0.0039906668 + 0.0006686 ≈ 0.0046592668.

So 0.9976667 * 1.00467 ≈ 0.9976667 + 0.0046592668 ≈ 1.0023259668.

Which is very close to 1.0023333.

So 1.0023333 / 0.9976667 ≈ 1.00467.

So [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ (1.00467)^2.

Compute 1.00467^2: 1 + 2*0.00467 + (0.00467)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.00934 + 0.0000218 ≈ 1.00936.

So (1.00467)^2 ≈ 1.00936.

So [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ 1.00936.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00936 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00936.

Compute 2.25 * 1.00936.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00936 = approx 0.02106.

So total is 2.27106.

So approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options, the closest option is D) ~2.23, or B) ~2.32, or C) ~2.35. Wait, 2.27 is closer to 2.27, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift. Let me re-examine the Doppler formula.

Another way to express the Doppler shift is (lambda_obs - lambda_emit)/(lambda_emit) = v/c.

Wait, but that's the approximation for small velocities, right? The exact formula is lambda_obs/lambda_emit = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) when the source is moving away. Wait, no, that's when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So if the source is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter.

Wait, another approach: let me express the Doppler shift factor as (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

When the source is moving towards us, z is negative. So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then z = -v/c = -beta.

The relation between observed and emitted wavelengths is lambda_obs = lambda_emit (1 + z).

So, lambda_obs = lambda_emit (1 + z) = lambda_emit (1 - beta).

Because z = -beta.

So, for Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_emit_2 (1 - beta).

But Star_1's lambda_obs = lambda_emit_1 = lambda_obs_2.

So,

lambda_emit_2 (1 - beta) = lambda_emit_1

=> lambda_emit_2 = lambda_emit_1 / (1 - beta)

Which is the same as earlier when using the sqrt formula.

So, T_emit_2 = b / lambda_emit_2 = b (1 - beta) / lambda_emit_1.

But T_emit_1 = b / lambda_emit_1.

So T_emit_2 = (1 - beta) * T_emit_1.

Therefore, T_ratio = T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 - beta) ≈ 1 + beta, since beta is small.

Thus, (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (1 + beta)^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4 = (2.25) * (1 + beta)^4.

beta is 0.02333.

(1 + beta)^4 = (1.02333)^4.

Compute (1.02333)^4.

We can compute it step by step.

(1.02333)^2 = 1.02333 * 1.02333.

1.02333 * 1 = 1.02333.

1.02333 * 0.02333 ≈ 0.02386.

So total approx 1.04719.

Then, (1.04719)^2 is (1.04719)^2.

Compute 1.04719 * 1.04719.

= (1 + 0.04719)^2 = 1 + 2*0.04719 + (0.04719)^2.

= 1 + 0.09438 + 0.002227 ≈ 1.0966.

So (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.0966.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0966 ≈ 2.467.

Hmm, same as before, around 2.47.

But the answer options don't include that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler effect is negligible because the velocity is small compared to the speed of light. Let me compute beta again: 700 km/s is 700e3 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s. So beta = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333, which is about 2.3% of c, which isn't that small. So the approximation may not hold, but perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximation.

Wait, the Doppler shift factor for wavelength is sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) when the source is moving towards us.

So for Star_2, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But since lambda_obs is same as Star_1's lambda_obs, which is lambda_emit_1.

So,

lambda_emit_2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = lambda_emit_1

=> lambda_emit_2 = lambda_emit_1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Thus,

T_emit_2 = b / lambda_emit_2 = b / [ lambda_emit_1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ]

= T_emit_1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

= T_emit_1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So, T_emit_1 / T_emit_2 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2

Thus, the previous calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the luminosity ratio.

Wait, L = 4πR²σT^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 ) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Which is correct.

So,

(R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 = (approx 1.0477)^2 = 1.0977.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0977 ≈ 2.469.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the temperature because the problem assumes that the observed lambda_max is used to compute the temperature. So maybe the problem is considering that the observed lambda_max is the same, so the temperatures are the same, and the velocities are a red herring.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars are blackbody radiators, and the luminosity is computed from that. So perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the Doppler shift because the problem says that the observed lambda_max is same, implying that the temperatures are the same (i.e., the Doppler effect is accounted for in determining T). Or perhaps the velocities affect the observed flux, but the luminosity is the intrinsic value.

Wait, if the observed lambda_max is same, then perhaps the temperatures are same, and the Doppler velocities don't affect T calculation. But that seems incorrect because the Doppler shift changes the observed wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem says that the stars' maximum emission is at same wavelength, so their temperatures are same. So T1 = T2.

In that case, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer is A) ~2.25.

But why then are the velocities given? Perhaps it's a distraction, and the correct approach is to ignore the Doppler shift because the problem states that the observed lambda_max is same, meaning T is same.

Wait, that might be the case. Let me think: the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is same → same T, because T is determined from observed data.

Thus, T1 = T2.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So the answer would be option A) ~2.25.

But earlier I thought that the Doppler shift would cause the temperatures to be different, but perhaps in this problem, the observed lambda_max is used to compute T, so T is same.

So, in that case, the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

But why give the velocities then? Maybe it's a distraction.

So, the correct approach is to take T1 = T2, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

Thus, the answer is A) ~2.25.


The problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with Star_1 having a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times greater. The observed wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same, and the radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The goal is to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, assuming the stars radiate as black bodies.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Wien's Law and Temperature**:  
   The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. By Wien's Law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
   \]  
   Since the observed \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) is the same for both stars, their temperatures are assumed to be equal (\(T_1 = T_2\)).

2. **Luminosity Formula**:  
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]  
   Since \(T_1 = T_2\), the ratio of luminosities depends only on the radii of the stars:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2
   \]

3. **Radius Ratio**:  
   Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 (\(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\)). Substituting this into the luminosity ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
   \]

4. **Radial Velocities and Doppler Shift**:  
   The radial velocities of the stars were initially considered, but the problem explicitly states that the observed \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) is the same for both stars. This implies that any Doppler shifts due to the velocities have been accounted for in determining the temperatures. Therefore, the radial velocities do not affect the calculation of the intrinsic luminosities.

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of \(2.25\). This corresponds to option **A**.
