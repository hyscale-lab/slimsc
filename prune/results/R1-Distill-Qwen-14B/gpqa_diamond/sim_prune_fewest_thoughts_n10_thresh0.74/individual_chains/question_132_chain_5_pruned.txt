Okay, so I have this NMR problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Wait, first, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. For C10H14, the formula is CnH2n+2 for a single ring (like benzene). Benzene has 3 double bonds and one ring, so maybe each compound is a substituted benzene.

The options are all tetramethylbenzenes except for option C which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let me check their structures.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. So that's four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring at positions 1,2,3,4. That would leave positions 5 and 6 empty, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1,2,3,4 are adjacent. So that would be a 1,2,3,4-tetra substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta arrangement?

Wait, no, 1,2,3,4 are adjacent in a row. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 as well, but position 4 is next to position 3 and position 5? No, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in order. So 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions. So that's a 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl substitution. That's a bit crowded but possible.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. So positions 1,2 are adjacent, 4,5 are adjacent as well. So that's two pairs of adjacent methyl groups. So the ring would have methyl groups in 1,2 and 4,5. So that makes a structure where opposite positions are substituted.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, but 1,4-diethyl would have two ethyl groups on the benzene. Let me think, C10H14. Wait, each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have the molecular formula C8H10 (since benzene is C6H6, two ethyls add 4 carbons and 6 hydrogens: C6 + 2*(C2H5) = C8H12? Wait, wait, benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5, so adding two gives C8H12. Wait, but the molecular formula given is C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would be C8H10, because each ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyls add 4 carbons and 10 hydrogens. C6 + 4 C = C10? Wait wait, no. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So two ethyls would add 2*2=4 carbons and 2*5=10 hydrogens. So the total is C6 +4 = C10, H6 +10 = H16. Wait, but the compound in the mixture is C10H14. So that doesn't fit. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Benzene has 6 carbons and 6 hydrogens. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl adds 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens. Two ethyls would add 4 carbons and 10 hydrogens. So the molecular formula would be C6+4= C10 and H6 +10 = H16. But the problem states the formula is C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have C8H10? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5, so substituting for a H, each ethyl group adds (C2H5) and removes one H from the benzene ring. So each ethyl is adding 2 carbons and 4 hydrogens (since -CH2CH3 has 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, but replacing one H on benzene, so net is 5-1=4 hydrogens). Therefore, two ethyl groups would add 4 carbons and 8 hydrogens. So total would be C6+4= C10 and H6+8= H14. Oh, that makes sense. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have the formula C10H14. So that's possible.

But wait, the mixture is 1:1 of two aromatic compounds, each has C10H14? Wait, no. Wait the mixture is two compounds each with C10H14? No, the question says the solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with molecular formula C10H14. Wait,
