Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what I can understand.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, so I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor, which depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in each level, g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is the energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio is n1/n2, but the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. Therefore, the factor by which it changes (without spots compared to with spots) would be the ratio when no spots are present divided by the ratio when there are spots.

Wait, let me clarify. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. So, when the star has no spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K, and when it has spots, the average Teff is 5500 K. But wait, I need to think about how the spots affect the overall photosphere.

Wait, but wait a second. The effective temperature is the average temperature of the star's surface. But when spots are present, the overall effective temperature decreases because spots are cooler. But the problem says the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the star's photosphere (the unspotted regions) might be hotter than 5500 K, but when considering the entire surface, the average is 5500 K because 40% is cooler.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So, the unspotted regions must be hotter than 6000 K? Because when 40% are cooler spots, the average temperature goes down. But in the no-spot case, the Teff is
