Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now they're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, the next 150 minutes after how much? Oh, wait, 50 minutes have already passed, so the next 150 would take the total to 200 minutes? Or is it the next 150 minutes from now, which is 50 minutes in?

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. The initial decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, 100 minutes is the half-life or something? Wait, wait. No, 32% is the probability, not necessarily the half-life. Or maybe it's a different kind of decay model.

Wait, radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? So the probability of decay is based on the time elapsed. The formula is usually P = 1 - e^(-位t), where 位 is the decay constant and t is time.

But wait, the question gives a 32% probability of decay within 100 minutes. So that would be P(100) = 0.32. Let's use that to find 位.

So let's compute 位
