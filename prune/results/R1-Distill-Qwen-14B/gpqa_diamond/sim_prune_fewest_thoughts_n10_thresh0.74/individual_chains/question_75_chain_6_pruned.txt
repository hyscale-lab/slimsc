Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the transgenic mouse model isn't expressing the GADD45G protein as expected. Let's see, the setup is that the researcher wants to study the role of GADD45G in SARS-CoV-2 infection by creating a transgenic mouse model where the gene is overexpressed. They introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus of the protein. Then they transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed.

The question is about the possible reason why. They provided the plus strand sequence of the construct. Let me look at the sequence. I need to find any issues that would prevent proper expression.

First, I'll think about the basics of a coding sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then I should look for any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) that might terminate translation prematurely. If there's an early stop codon, the ribosome would terminate, and the protein would be truncated—maybe not expressed at all or not detected properly.

Let me scan the sequence for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking through the sequence... Let me go step by step.

The sequence provided is long, so I'll look for the presence of these codons. Let's see:

Looking at the first part: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

I'll go through each triplet and check for the stop codons.

Wait, let me look for the stop codon 'TGA' or 'TAA' or 'TAG' in the sequence.

Hmm, looking through the sequence:

- ATG (start)
- TAC (tyrosine)
- CCA (proline)
- TAC (tyr)
- GAT (aspartic acid)
- GCT (alanine)
- TCC (serine)
- AGA (arginine)
- etc.

Wait, I should scan for any TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let me see:

Looking at the start and end, I notice the sequence ends with ... TGA. Let me check the end part:

...GCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, the last part before the end is ...GCGAGTGA. Wait, the last few letters are TGA. Let me count the letters. Let's break it down:

The last part is:

...AGTGA

Wait, wait, perhaps I should approach this more methodically.

The coding sequence is in the plus strand, so the mRNA would be complementary. But the construct is the coding sequence, so the DNA's plus strand is the same as mRNA except T for U.

Wait, no. The given DNA sequence is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to the template (antisense) strand. So the DNA's coding strand is same as mRNA, except T instead of U.

Wait, no. The coding (sense) strand is the same as mRNA, except the mRNA is made from the template (antisense) strand. So the coding strand has the same sequence as the mRNA, with T instead of U.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. The DNA has two strands: the coding (sense) strand and the non-coding (antisense) strand. The mRNA is synthesized using the antisense strand as a template, so the mRNA is complementary to the antisense strand, which is the same as the coding (sense) strand but with U instead of T.

So, the given DNA sequence is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be identical except for T→U substitution.

So, any TGA in the coding DNA would be TGA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon (amber stop). Similarly, TAA would be a stop codon (ochre), and TAG is (opal).

So, looking for the presence of any TGA, TAA, or TAG in the coding sequence.
