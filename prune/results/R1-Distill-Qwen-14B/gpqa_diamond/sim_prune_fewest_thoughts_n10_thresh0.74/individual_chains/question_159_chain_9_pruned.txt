Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let's see what it says. Alright, the question is about observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum, focusing on near-infrared and optical. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the question, but maybe it's about redshift or something else.

Wait, the main part of the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. The universe parameters are given: Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density is 0.7, and it's a flat universe. So, I need to find the comoving distance for a quasar at a certain redshift, I think.

Comoving distance... right, that's the distance in a flat universe that would be measured by a hypothetical ruler at the time of emission, scaled to the present day. The formula for comoving distance (D_C) is the integral of c/(H0 * E(z)) dz from 0 to z, where E(z) is the expansion factor. E(z) is sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda*(1+z)^{3w}), but wait, dark energy is usually modeled as a cosmological constant, so w=-1, making it (1+z)^0, so E(z)=sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda).

But wait, how do I connect this to the quasar's peak? Oh, wait, the peak at 790 nm probably relates to the Lyman-alpha emission line or something else. Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is in the UV at about 121 nm. If the peak is at 790 nm, which is near-infrared, that must be due to redshift. So 790 nm is longer than the rest wavelength. So the observed wavelength λ_obs = (1 + z) * λ_rest. Let me think. For Lyman-alpha, λ_rest is 121.6 nm. If the observed peak is 790 nm, that's much longer. So (1+z) = 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5. So z ≈ 5.5.

Wait, but wait. Does
