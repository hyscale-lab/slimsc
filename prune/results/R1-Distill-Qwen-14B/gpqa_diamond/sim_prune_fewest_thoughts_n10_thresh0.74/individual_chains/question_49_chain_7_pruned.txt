Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember from my notes are a type of pericyclic reaction where a sigma bond moves along with a shift in the pi bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of this, right?

The problem has three separate reactions, and I need to determine the products A, B, and C. Then, I'll match them with the given options. Let's break each part down.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form A. Hmm, I think this is a Claisen-type rearrangement because it involves an enol ether or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a Cope rearrangement, but Claisen is more about esters or ethers.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like a structure where the amine is in the middle, with two methoxy groups attached. So, it's (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Another way to look at it: the compound is 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine. So, the structure would be NH2-C(CH3O)2. So, it's a secondary amine with two methoxy groups on the adjacent carbon.

But-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. Its structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. Wait, no, let me think again. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2-OH-CH2? No, but wait, the positions are 3-en and 2-ol. So, the double bond is between C3 and C2. Wait, but that can't be right because but-3-en-2-ol would have the hydroxyl on C2 and a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No,
