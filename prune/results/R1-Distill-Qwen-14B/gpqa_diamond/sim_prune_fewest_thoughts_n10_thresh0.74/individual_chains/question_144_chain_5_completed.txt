Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And they can decay, so I guess the mean decay distance is how far they travel before they break down.

The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so I need to calculate the mean decay length. 

Wait, I think the mean decay distance or mean proper lifetime is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is connected to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula I remember is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I have to make sure about the units here.

So first, let me compute the lifetime τ. Then, I can find the velocity of the meson because the mean decay distance is v multiplied by τ. Because the particle is moving, right? So the proper lifetime is multiplied by velocity and the time it lives.

Wait, but how do I get the velocity? I know that the energy E is related to the mass and velocity. The total energy of the particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor, and m is rest mass. So γ is E/(m c²). Let me compute γ first.

Given E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. Wait, but in units where c=1, E is in GeV, mass is in GeV/c², so perhaps the calculation is easier. Wait, but I have to be careful with units when plugging into equations.

Wait, another approach: The velocity can be found from the energy. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². So γ is E/(m c²). Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E=γ m. So γ is E/(m) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Then, to find the velocity, I can use β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Wait, no, wait. Actually, for a particle, β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²))? Or is it the other way around? Wait, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - β²), so β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, let me compute that. So γ is 6.6667, so 1/γ² is (1/6.6667)^2 = 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So β is about 0.9887, meaning v is about 0.9887c. Hmm, that's a high velocity.

Now, the proper lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV. ħ has units of GeV·s, I think. Let me recall the values. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is 6.626e-34 J·s, but converting to GeV·s units: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1.602e-10 J. So ħ ≈ 6.626e-34 J·s / (2π) ≈ 1.054e-34 J·s. Hmm, maybe I should just remember that ħ in GeV·s is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.320 GeV. So Γ = 0.320 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.320 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.320 s ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me check that calculation. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.0569e-24 s. Right.

Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ. But v is β c. So L = β c τ.

So let's compute that. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So:

β ≈ 0.9887, c = 3e8 m/s, τ ≈ 2.0569e-24 s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s.

Let me compute 0.9887 * 3 = approx 2.9661.

So 2.9661e8 * 2.0569e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.0569) * 1e-16.

Wait, 2.9661 * 2.0569 is about 6.107, because 3 * 2 is 6, so maybe 6.1 or similar.

So 6.107e-16 m? Wait, but let me double-check the exponents.

Wait, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 2e-24 s would be 6e-16 m. So 6.1e-16 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m, option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, but wait I think I made an approximation in the calculation. Maybe I should be more precise.

Let me re-calculate the precise steps.

Compute γ: E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

γ = E/(m c²) = 8 / (1.2) ≈ 6.6666667.

Then, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

1/γ² = 1/(44.444444) ≈ 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, as before.

So β ≈ 0.9887, okay.

Then, Γ = 0.32 GeV, τ = ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, L = beta * c * tau.

beta ≈ 0.9887, c = 2.9979e8 m/s (more accurately, 3e8 is approximate, but let me use 3 for calculation, though exact value might affect the precise answer.)

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.107e-16 m.

Wait, but none of the options are around 6e-16. The options are 5e-16 and 4e-16.

Hmm, perhaps I did something wrong. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, the mean decay length is L = c tau * beta.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Wait, is the formula correct? Because sometimes, the mean proper lifetime is tau, and the lifetime experienced is gamma tau, but no, I think when you have a particle moving with velocity v, the decay length is v * tau, because tau is the proper lifetime, and the particle's lifetime from the lab frame is gamma tau. Oh wait, no, wait.

Wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the mean decay length is v * gamma tau. Because from the lab frame, the particle lives longer.

Wait, did I make a mistake here? Because I might have confused the proper time and the lab frame time.

Let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau = ħ / Gamma. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the mean decay distance is v * (gamma tau).

Wait, but v = beta c, and gamma is E/(m c²), which is 6.6667.

So let me recompute L.

L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, but earlier I thought tau was the lab frame time, but no, tau is the proper time.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The width Gamma is the decay width, which is related to the mean proper lifetime tau by Gamma = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

But in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer: t = gamma tau.

Therefore, the mean decay length is L = v * t = v gamma tau.

Wait, so that would change the calculation.

Earlier, I computed L as beta c tau, but perhaps I forgot to multiply by gamma.

So if I compute it correctly, L = beta c * gamma tau.

Wait, because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the decay length is beta c multiplied by gamma tau.

Wait, but let me think: tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). So when you are in the lab frame, which sees the particle moving, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. Therefore, the decay length is v multiplied by gamma tau.

So L = v gamma tau.

So v is beta c.

So L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, but gamma is E/(m c²), so let's compute everything.

Compute each part step by step.

Compute gamma:

gamma = E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV * c^2). Wait, but in units where c=1, E = gamma m, so gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667 as before.

So gamma =6.6667.

Tau is ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/(44.4444)) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, as before.

So putting it all together:

L = 0.9887 * c * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but c is 3e8 m/s.

So compute each part:

0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.611.

Then, 6.611 * 3e8 m/s = 1.9833e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.9833e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ (1.9833 * 2.056875) * 1e-15 m.

Wait, 1.9833 * 2.056875 is approximately 4.084.

So L ≈ 4.084e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, 4.084 is close to option B's 4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, I used approximations in the beta calculation. Let me be more precise.

Calculate beta more accurately.

gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666666667.

So 1/gamma^2 is (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma^2 is 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is let me compute it more accurately.

0.9775 is between 0.98^2 (0.9604) and 0.99^2 (0.9801). Wait wait, wait:

Wait 0.98² is 0.9604, 0.988² is (0.98+0.008)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008² = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144.

But 0.9775 is higher than that. So 0.988^2 =0.976144. 0.9775-0.976144=0.001356. So how much more?

Let me think using a linear approximation.

Let x =0.988, x² =0.976144.

We need to find x such that x²=0.9775.

Let delta = x² - 0.976144 = 0.001356.

Approximate delta ≈ 2x dx.

So dx ≈ delta/(2x) = 0.001356/(2*0.988) ≈ 0.001356/(1.976) ≈ 0.000686.

So x ≈ 0.988 + 0.000686 ≈ 0.988686.

So beta ≈ 0.988686.

So more accurately, beta is approx 0.9887, which is what I used earlier.

So beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, gamma is 8/1.2=6.6666667.

tau =6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = (beta c) * gamma tau = (2.9661e8 m/s) * (6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s).

Wait, no, wait, gamma is 6.6667, and tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So (beta c) * gamma tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, no, that's not correct. It's (beta c) multiplied by (gamma tau).

So L = beta c * gamma tau.

beta c = 2.9661e8 m/s.

gamma tau =6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

So multiply 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, 2.9661e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.9661 * 1.37125) * 1e-15.

Compute 2.9661 * 1.37125.

Let me compute that:

2 * 1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.9661 * 1.37125 ≈ approx 1.322.

So total is about 2.7425 + 1.322 ≈4.0645.

So L ≈4.0645e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the relationship between the decay width $\Gamma$, the mean proper lifetime $\tau$, and the velocity $\beta$ of the particle. The steps are as follows:

1. **Relating $\Gamma$ and $\tau$:**  
   The mean proper lifetime $\tau$ is related to the decay width $\Gamma$ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
   \]  
   Given $\hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}$ and $\Gamma = 0.320 \, \text{GeV}$, we calculate:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.320} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Relating $\gamma$ and $\beta$:**  
   The Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667.
   \]  
   The velocity $\beta$ is related to $\gamma$ by:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
   \]  
   Substituting $\gamma = 6.6667$, we find:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
   \]

3. **Calculating the mean decay distance $L$:**  
   The mean decay distance is given by:  
   \[
   L = \beta c \gamma \tau,
   \]  
   where $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$. Substituting the values:  
   \[
   L = (0.9887)(3 \times 10^8)(6.6667)(2.0569 \times 10^{-24}).
   \]  
   First, compute $\beta c \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$.  
   Next, compute $\gamma \tau \approx 6.6667 \times 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}$.  
   Finally, multiply:  
   \[
   L = (2.9661 \times 10^8)(1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.0645 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Comparing with the options:**  
   The calculated value of $L \approx 4.0645 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$ is closest to option **B**, which is $4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$.

Answer: B
