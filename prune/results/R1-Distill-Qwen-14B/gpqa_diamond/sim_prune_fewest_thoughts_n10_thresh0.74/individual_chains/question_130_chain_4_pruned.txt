Okay, so I have this question about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm. The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. So when a quasar's light passes through a hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs that light at 1216 Angstroms. Now, if this absorption is observed from a ground-based telescope, which can't see UV because the atmosphere blocks it. Oh right, ground-based telescopes can't observe UV wavelengths; that's why space telescopes like Hubble are used for such observations. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, the redshift must be such that 1216 Angstroms is shifted into the visible spectrum.

So, the rest wavelength is λ0 = 1216 Angstroms. Let's convert that to nanometers because optical wavelengths are in the hundreds of nanometers. Oh wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. That's in the far UV, which the atmosphere doesn't let through. So how much redshift is needed so that this wavelength moves into the optical range, say around 400 nm or longer?

The formula for redshift is z = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest. We need λ_observed to be at least in the optical window. Let's say the lowest optical wavelength is around 300 nm, maybe. Let me think, visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, but ground-based telescopes can't see below about 300 nm, perhaps? Or maybe they can't observe below about 300 nm because of atmospheric absorption. Alternatively, I should perhaps consider the atmospheric transmission. The atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm, so if the observed wavelength is above 300
