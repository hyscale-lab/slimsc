Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a certain reaction.

Alright, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize this molecule. So, cyclohex-3-ene means there's a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 of the cyclohexane ring. Then there's a formyl group (a CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (a CH2CH2 group, but wait, vinyl is CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- right? So, a vinyl group is like a CH2CH2 with a double bond. So, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, no: 2-formyl means the formyl is on carbon 2 of the cyclohexane. 5-vinyl is a vinyl substituent on carbon 5. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between 3 and 4, a formyl at 2, and a vinyl at 5. Then, carboxylic acid group is also present. Since it's cyclohexenecarboxylic acid, the carboxylic acid is probably at position 1, because the numbering starts such that the double bond is between 3 and 4, and the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Wait, but the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, right? Because the numbering starts to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers.

So putting that together, the molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. At C2 is a formyl group (CHO), at C5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2 with a double bond?), and at C1 is the carboxylic acid (COOH).

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but wait, no, wait. Oh, right! Red phosphorus is used in the presence of HI for the dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions, but wait, another thought: when you have a carbonyl group and HI, maybe it's a type of addition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of an enol.

Wait no, another possibility: Red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, that's when you have nitriles reacting with H2O and red phosphorus to form amines. Wait no, wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, in the presence of HI and red P, maybe it's the formation of an ylide, but that's more for Wittig reactions.

Wait, another possibility: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reaction called the "Hoffmann elimination" but that's for am
