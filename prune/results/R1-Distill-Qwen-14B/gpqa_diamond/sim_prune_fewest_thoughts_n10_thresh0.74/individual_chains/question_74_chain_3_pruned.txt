Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, but there's some probability involved. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that an atom has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, does that mean that after 100 minutes, 32% of the atoms decay? Or is it the probability that any single atom decays in that time? I think it's about the survival probability. Oh wait, no. In radioactive decay, the decay constant is involved, and the probability is exponential. So the usual formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt). Or maybe it's the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t, which would be P_survival = e^(-λt). So the probability it has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

Wait the question states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So P = 32% = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So we can solve for λ, the decay constant.

Wait, but let me think again. The decay probability per unit time is given by λ, and the probability of decay in time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt). So if P is 32%, which is 0.32, then 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So rearranging, e^(-λ*100)
