Okay, so I've got this question about an organic chemistry problem. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll think through what I remember.

The question says: We have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. We need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options.

First, let's parse the structure. A 6-membered aromatic ring, so probably benzene or a substituted benzene. Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. The total number of carbons is 8, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons because benzene has 6 carbons.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so the ring itself has 6 carbons. The substituents add 2 more carbons because 6 + 2 = 8. Hmm. So each substituent could be a methyl group (but two methyl groups would add 2 carbons), or one substituent could be a carbonyl group and another group that's a halogen perhaps? Wait, but wait. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or maybe an ester or something), and another is a halogen attached to the ring. But wait, the substituents are in the aromatic ring, so the halogen is on the ring, and the carbonyl group is another substituent.

Wait, but wait. The substituents on the aromatic ring can't themselves have carbonyl groups unless they're part of a larger substituent. For example, a carbonyl group as part of an acetyl group attached to the ring. So let me think: the substituents are a halogen (like Cl or Br) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as an acetyl group (COCH3), which would add two carbons (the CO is part of the substituent, but the substituent itself is O=C- attached to a methyl group, I think. Wait, no. Wait, the acetyl group is O=C-O- if it's an ester, but more likely, perhaps a ketone like a methyl
