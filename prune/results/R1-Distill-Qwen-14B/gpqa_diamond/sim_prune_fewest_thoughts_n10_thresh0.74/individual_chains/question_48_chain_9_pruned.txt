Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending up with product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Alright, let's break this down. I'll need to go through each reaction step and see what's happening. Then I'll figure out the structure of product 4 and count its distinct hydrogen atoms.

Starting with cyclohexanone. Structure-wise, that's a six-membered cyclohexane ring with a ketone group (O) attached. So it's a cyclic ketone.

First reaction: cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2), forming product 1. I remember that bromine adds to ketones in a specific way. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you treat ketones with Br2, it's a type of addition reaction. Oh, but wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone with Br2 would undergo a bromination, but where? Oh, wait, I think in such cases, the carbonyl becomes a bromoketone, but no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's an enolate formation. Or perhaps it's a dienone thing. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, when a ketone is treated with bromine, it's usually via the enolate. So maybe it's a conjugate addition? Or perhaps an electrophilic addition.

Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. So when you add bromine, I think it's a bromohydrin formation? Or maybe it's an addition across the carbonyl group. Wait no, wait, bromine probably adds to the carbonyl group. Wait, but ketones don't usually add bromine directly; they might need some activation. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dibromination, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone can undergo a bromination via a cyclic transition state. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a dihalide formation. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps bromine adds across the carbonyl group, leading to a vicinal dihalide, but for ketones, that's not possible because the carb
