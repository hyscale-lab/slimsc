Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots formed. I need to determine which of the options A to D could be the products.

Hmm, so the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me try to draw its structure. The benzene ring has an oxygen attached, which is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, no, wait. Wait, but the butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So that would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, numbering. Let me think: for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? But that can't be right because but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, wait, no. Let's see. But-3-en-1-yl: the chain is four carbons, with the double bond starting at C3. So positions 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, which is the end. So actually, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't have a double bond at 3. Oh wait, wait, but that's a four-carbon chain, so the possible double bonds are between 1-2, 2-3. For but-3-en-1-yl, that would imply the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible because the chain is only four carbons long. Wait, maybe I'm numbering from the
