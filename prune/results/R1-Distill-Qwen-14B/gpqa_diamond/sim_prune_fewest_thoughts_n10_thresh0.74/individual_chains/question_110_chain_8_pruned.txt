Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. 

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method. But the key here is their brightness limits. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 16. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag can be seen by both? Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, it's the opposite. Because higher magnitude means fainter. So a star with V mag less than 17 is brighter than 17, which ESPRESSO can see. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, which would be V mag less than or equal to 16.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So a V mag less than 17 is brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars with V <17. Similarly, HIRES can see stars with V <16.

So the stars that can be detected by both would need to have apparent V magnitudes less than 17 (so ESP
