Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details.

Alright, so there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and a Teff of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with 1.3 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits and the same albedo. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are A to D, with various values. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I need to think about the formula for equilibrium temperature.

Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, but albedo is the same for both planets, so that cancels out in the ratio.

The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5. Wait, maybe I should get the exact formula right. Let me think. The equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T*( ( L / (16πσ a² (1 - A)) ) )^0.25. But L is the star's luminosity, which depends on the star's radius and effective temperature via L = 4πR_star²σ T_eff^4. So substituting that in, the formula becomes T_eq = T_eff * ( ( R_star² ) / (4 a² (1 - A)) ) )^0.5 * (1/(2)) )^0.5. Hmm, maybe I should simplify this.

Alternatively, I think the formula can be rewritten as T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * sqrt( (1 - A) )^0.5. Wait, not sure. Maybe another approach. Alternatively, T_eq for a planet is given by:

T_eq = [ ( L * (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4 )

Where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan
