Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that in scattering theory, especially in the context of partial waves, the scattering amplitude plays a crucial role. The scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial waves. Oh right, the formula involves a sum over all the angular momentum states, each contributing with a term involving the phase shifts δ_l.

The formula I recall is f(θ) = (1/(2i)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(2δ_l) / sin(θ) ) ] * ... Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe it's better to look up the exact form. Oh, no, I can't look things up right now. So I have to remember.

Wait, I think the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of the partial waves is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, that's for the amplitude in general. But the problem specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, wait, along the incident beam direction would be θ=0 degrees. Because
