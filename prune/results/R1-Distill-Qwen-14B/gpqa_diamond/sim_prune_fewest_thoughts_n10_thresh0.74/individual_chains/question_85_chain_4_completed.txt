Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature for a planet depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that cancels out. So the main factors are the star's luminosity and the distance of each planet from the star.

Wait, but to find the equilibrium temperature, there's a formula. I think it's something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), but since albedo A is the same for both planets, the (1-A) part will be the same for both. So they'll cancel out when taking the ratio.

Wait, but let me get the exact formula. I remember the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_eff * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but maybe that's not exactly right. Oh wait, another approach: The star's luminosity is L, and the planet is at a distance a. The planet reflects some light, but for equilibrium temperature, we consider the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy. So the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4), where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but in this problem, do I have the star's luminosity or is it easier to compute based on the information given? The star's mass, radius, and Teff are given. Oh, I know that the star's luminosity can be found using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So for each planet, their equilibrium temperature depends on the luminosity of the star and their distance from it.

So the steps I think I should follow are:

1. Calculate the star's luminosity using L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But wait, maybe I don't need the actual value, just the ratio.

Wait, but since both planets orbit the same star, their L is the same. So when taking the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, the L will cancel out. So the ratio T1/T2 would involve sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2))), but wait, no, because each planet has a different a. Wait, no, wait. The formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ). Wait, no, let me get this right.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2 a) )

Wait, is that correct? Because the flux from the star at distance a is L/(4πa²), but L is 4π R_s² sigma Teff^4, so substituting:

Flux F = (4 pi R_s² sigma Teff^4) / (4 pi a²) ) = (R_s^2 sigma Teff^4) / a²

The planet absorbs (1 - A) * F * π R_p², where R_p is planet radius. Then, the energy radiated is 4 pi R_p^2 sigma T_p^4. Setting them equal:

(1 - A) F π R_p^2 = 4 π R_p^2 sigma T_p^4

Cancel R_p^2 and pi from both sides:

(1 - A) F /4 = sigma T_p^4

Substituting F:

(1 - A) (R_s^2 sigma Teff^4 / a²) /4 = sigma T_p^4

Cancel sigma:

(1-A) R_s^2 Teff^4 / (4 a²) ) = T_p^4

Take the fourth root:

T_p = Teff * ( (1 - A)^(1/4) ) * (R_s^2)^(1/4) / ( (4 a²) )^(1/4) )

Simplify exponents:

= Teff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * R_s^(1/2) / ( (4)^(1/4) * a^(1/2) )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. But since the albedos are the same for both planets, (1 - A) is the same, so when taking the ratio T1/T2, those terms cancel.

So T1/T2 = [ (R_s^(1/2) / a1^(1/2) ) ] / [ (R_s^(1/2) / a2^(1/2) ) ]

Which simplifies to sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So I need to find the ratio of the distances of the two planets from the star.

But how do I find a1 and a2? The question provides information about their RV shifts, which relates to their orbital velocities and masses.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which tells us the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star in response. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

But since the planets are much less massive than the star, M_star >> M_p, so we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But wait, the problem gives the RV shifts in terms of wavelength shifts. Oh, I think the Doppler shift formula relates velocity to the wavelength shift. So the RV semi-amplitude K is the star's velocity, which can be converted into a wavelength shift using the formula:

Δλ/λ = v/c = (K c) / c = K / c.

Wait, no, the formula is Δλ/λ = v/c. So given Δλ, you can find v by v = c * (Δλ/λ).

In the problem, it says Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, Δλ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å. So the velocity K1 is (0.03 / 6300) * c.

Similarly, Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å, so K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, but for each planet, the RV shift depends on the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital period. But the problem says the orbits are circular. So, let's get back to the RV formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(2/3) )) )

But since e=0 (circular orbit) and M_p << M_star, this simplifies.

Wait, another approach: the RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But since we don't know the periods, maybe we can relate the velocities to the orbital distances via Kepler's third law.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the relation between a1 and a2 using Kepler's law.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³) / (G (M_star + M_p)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, this approximates to P² = (4π² a³) / (G M_star) )

So a^3 = (G M_star P² )/(4 π² )

But without knowing the periods P1 and P2, this approach might not work directly. Hmm.

Wait, but the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is given for each planet. K is related to the orbital period and semi-major axis.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) )

But again, this seems complicated. Since I don't have the inclination angle i, but perhaps the problem assumes that sin i is the same for both planets, or that it's 90 degrees (edge-on, so sin i =1). That's a common assumption in such problems.

So, assuming i=90 degrees, so sin i=1. Then:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 π² a³)/( G (M_star + M_p) ) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, P² ≈ (4 π² a³ )/(G M_star )

So P = ( (4 π² a³ )/(G M_star ) )^(1/2)

Substitute into K:

K = [ (2 π G )^(1/3) * M_p ] / [ (M_star )^(2/3) * ( (4 π² a^3)/( G M_star ) )^(1/6) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator:

Denominator is (M_star^(2/3)) * [ (4 π² a^3 / (G M_star) )^(1/6) ) ]

Which is M_star^(2/3) * (4 π²)^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) ( G^( -1/6 ) M_star^(-1/6) )

So combine exponents for M_star:

M_star^(2/3 - 1/6) ) = M_star^(1/2 )

So denominator becomes: (4 π²)^(1/6) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(1/2)

Putting it all together, K becomes:

K = [ (2 π G )^(1/3) M_p ] / [ (4 π² )^(1/6) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Simplify the constants:

(2 π G )^(1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/6) ) = [ (2^(1) π^(1) G^(1) ) / (4^(1/2) π^(2*(1/6)) ) ) ]^(1/3 * 6) ?

Wait, perhaps better to write exponents as fractions.

Let me think:

(2 π G )^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) G^(1/3)

Denominator part: (4 π² )^(1/6) = 4^(1/6) π^(2/6) = 2^(2/6) π^(1/3) ) = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3)

So, numerator: 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) G^(1/3) * M_p

Denominator: [2^(1/3) π^(1/3) ] * a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(1/2)

So the 2^(1/3) and π^(1/3) terms cancel.

So K = [ G^(1/3) M_p ] / [ a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Combine G exponents: G^(1/3 + 1/6) )= G^(1/2 )

So K = ( G^(1/2) M_p ) / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )

Which can be written as:

K = sqrt( G / ( a M_star ) ) * M_p

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange this to find a in terms of K.

Wait, solving for a:

K = M_p * sqrt( G ) / sqrt( a M_star )

Square both sides:

K² = M_p² G / (a M_star )

Multiply both sides by a:

K² a = ( M_p² G ) / M_star

Then,

a = ( M_p² G ) / ( K² M_star )

So, a is proportional to M_p² / (K² )

But wait, no, because K is given for each planet, so for each planet, a_i is proportional to (M_p_i )² / ( K_i² )

Wait, but considering that G and M_star are constants here (same for both planets), so the ratio of a1 to a2 is ( M1² / K1² ) / ( M2² / K2² ) ) = ( M1² K2² ) / ( M2² K1² )

So,

a1/a2 = (M1² K2² ) / ( M2² K1² )

Once I have a1 and a2, then the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, let's compute a1/a2 first.

Given:

M1 = 7 Earth masses

M2 =5 Earth masses

K1 corresponds to the shift from Planet1: 0.03 Å

K2 corresponds to the shift from Planet2: 0.04 Å

Wait, but K is proportional to the velocity of the star. So the shift in velocity is v = K * c / c, but in terms of the shift in wavelength, as per the Doppler formula.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star. The shift in wavelength is given by Δλ/λ = v/c. So for each planet, K = (Δλ / λ ) * c.

Wait, wait, the formula is:

Δλ / λ = v / c

So v = c * (Δλ / λ )

Thus, K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300 )

K2 = c * (0.04 / 6300 )

So K1 and K2 are proportional to 0.03 and 0.04 respectively.

So K1 = 0.03 * c / 6300

K2 = 0.04 * c /6300

Thus, K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

So K1 = (3/4) K2.

Now, back to a1/a2 = ( M1² K2² ) / ( M2² K1² )

Plugging in the numbers:

M1 =7, M2=5

K1 = (3/4) K2

So substituting,

a1/a2 = (7² * K2² ) / (5² * (3/4 K2 )² )

Simplify:

The K2² cancels out.

= (49 * 1 ) / (25 * (9/16) ) )

= 49 / ( (25 *9 ) /16 )

= 49 *16 / (225 )

Compute 49 *16: 49*16=784

784 / 225 ≈ 3.4844...

So a1/a2 ≈ 3.4844

Thus, the ratio of a1 to a2 is about 3.4844. So a1 is about 3.4844 times a2.

Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt(1/3.4844 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536

So T1 is about 0.536 times T2, so the ratio T1/T2 is approximately 0.536.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.53, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any miscalculations?

Wait, another way: a1/a2 = (7^2 * K2^2)/(5^2 * K1^2 )

Since K1 = 0.03 and K2=0.04, K1/K2=0.03/0.04=3/4.

So K2/K1=4/3.

So a1/a2 = (49 * (4/3)^2 ) / (25 * 1 )

Because (K2/K1)^2 = (4/3)^2.

So,

49 * (16/9) /25

= (49 *16) / (9 *25 )

= 784 / 225 ≈3.4844.

So yes, same as before.

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt( 1/3.4844 ) ≈ 0.536.

So the closest option is C) ~0.53.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I got a1 and a2 mixed up.

Wait, a1 is the distance of Planet1, a2 that of Planet2.

In the formula, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so if a1 is larger than a2, T1 would be smaller than T2.

Which matches our result.

So the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.53 times that of Planet2.

So the ratio T1:T2 is 0.53:1, so option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_p = T_s \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2a}}
\]

where \(T_s\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance. Since both planets orbit the same star, \(T_s\) and \(R_s\) are constant, and the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Distances to Radial Velocity Shifts
The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to the star's velocity induced by the planet, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital distance. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{1/2}}
\]

Rearranging for \(a\), we find:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p^2}{K^2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_1^2 / K_1^2}{M_2^2 / K_2^2} = \frac{M_1^2 K_2^2}{M_2^2 K_1^2}
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Values
- \(M_1 = 7\) Earth masses, \(M_2 = 5\) Earth masses
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

First, calculate the ratio \(K_2 / K_1\):

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{0.04}{0.03} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Now, substitute into the formula for \(a_1 / a_2\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(7^2)(4/3)^2}{(5^2)(1)} = \frac{49 \cdot \frac{16}{9}}{25} = \frac{784}{225} \approx 3.484
\]

Thus, \(a_1 / a_2 \approx 3.484\).

### Step 3: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.484}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \(0.53\), which corresponds to option **C**.
