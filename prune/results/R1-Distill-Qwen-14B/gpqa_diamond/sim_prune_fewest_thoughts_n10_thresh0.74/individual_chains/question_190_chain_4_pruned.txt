Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, and I need to arrange the given nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on several factors, like the solvent, the basicity of the nucleophile, and the structure. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, I think that plays a big role here.

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)

Wait, methanol is CH3OH, but in the options, I think I've seen CH3O⁻ as a nucleophile. Oh wait, no. Wait, methanol is a neutral molecule. So in an aqueous solution, it's not deprotonated, unless in a very strong base. But in this case, considering aqueous solutions, the basicity would influence how strong a nucleophile they are.

I remember that in polar protic solvents, the ability of a nucleophile to attack is influenced by how well it can stabilize its charge. More polarizable and less solvated ions are better nucleophiles. Also, the strength of the base can matter inversely because stronger bases are better nucleophiles in such solvents.

Let me think about each nucleophile's strength in aqueous solution.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is an alkoxide ion, so it's a strong base. But alkoxide ions can be bulky. Wait, the structure is 4-methylcyclohexanolate. So it's a conjugate base of an alcohol—like a cyclohexanol derivative. Alkoxides are good nucleophiles, but steric hindrance may play a role here. The 4-methyl group might make it more bulky. So compared to hydroxide, perhaps it's less reactive? Or depends on the solvent.

2. Hydroxide (OH⁻): A strong base and a good nucleophile in polar aprotic solvents. But in polar protic solvents like water, it's less nucleophilic because it's stabilized (solvated) a lot. Wait, but compared to other nucleophiles, maybe it's more reactive than some others.

3. Propionate: CH₂CH₂COO⁻. That's the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker base compared to hydroxide because it's a carboxylate. Wait, no, actually, carboxylate ions are weaker bases than hydroxide. Wait, the basicity order is: RS⁻ > RO⁻ > RCOO⁻. So ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is a stronger base than hydroxide? Wait, no, that's not right. I think I got that wrong. Let me think. Actually, in the gas phase, HS⁻ is less basic than OH⁻ because H2S is weaker acid than H2O. But in aqueous solution, the situation is different due to solvation. Wait, in aqueous solution, the order of basicity is: RO⁻ (like OH⁻) is more basic than RCOO⁻. But wait, actually, the conjugate base strength: stronger acids have weaker conjugate bases. H2O is a stronger acid than H2S. Because H2S has a lower pKa (around 7) compared to H2O (pKa ~15.7). Wait, no, wait. Wait, H2O's pKa is about 15.7, H2S is around 7, which is a stronger acid. So the conjugate base of H2S is weaker than that of H2O. So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no, wait: stronger acid has weaker conjugate base. Since H2S is stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2O, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So in terms of basicity, OH⁻ is stronger than HS⁻, and both are stronger than
