Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through. 

The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. The options are given, so maybe I can tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with something like ethyl acrylate, it's probably an enolate alkylation or some kind of addition. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester, so maybe this is a Michael addition or maybe some kind of conjugate addition. Alternatively, it could be a Claisen-Schmidt condensation? Or perhaps an aldol addition since it's a ketone and an ester.

Wait, but t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So maybe it's an enolate formation. Let me think about the structure of the starting material. The cyclohexanone has substituents at positions 2, 2, and 6. So 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. The ketone is at position 1. Wait, is that correct? Wait, cyclohexanone would have the carbonyl at position 1. So the substituents are at 2,2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with the carbonyl group at C1, an ethyl group and a methyl at C2, and another methyl at C6.

When t-BuOK is used, it's a strong base that can deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. So the enolate would form at the alpha position. But which alpha position is more acidic and more accessible? The enolate formation would happen at the less substituted position because of steric hindrance, or maybe the more substituted because of conjugation? Wait, the enolate's stability depends on the substituents. More substituted enolates are more stable due to conjugation.

So the ketone is at C1. The alpha carbons are at C2 and C6, because in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, and the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is next to two others. So position C2 is adjacent to C1 and C3, and position C6 is adjacent to C1 and C5.

Looking at the substituents: C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. So it's more substituted. C6 has only a methyl group. So when the base deprotonates, which alpha hydrogen is more acidic and where will the enolate form?

The acidity of alpha hydrogens is influenced by the stability of the resulting enolate. A more substituted double bond (the enolate) is more stable. So if the base removes a proton from C2, which is more substituted, the resulting enolate would be more stable. Alternatively, the bulky base might prefer to abstract a proton that's less hindered, such as from
