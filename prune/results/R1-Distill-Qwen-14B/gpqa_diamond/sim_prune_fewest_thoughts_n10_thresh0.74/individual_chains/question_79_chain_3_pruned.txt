Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the NMR data of the product. 

First, let's read the problem carefully. Compound X is subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to determine what Compound X was from the options provided.

Wait, what's the reagent here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation, but wait, no. Wait, Sharpless is for epoxidizing epoxides in allylic alcohols. Or wait, maybe it's used in other reactions. Alternatively, I remember that this compound is a base, maybe used in elimination reactions or in some kind of ring-opening or as a catalyst.

Wait, no, I think 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually used in the formation of epoxides. Oh, wait, wait, the reagent is actually part of the epoxidation process. Oh, right! It's a catalyst for the epoxidation of alkenes, perhaps using peracids as the oxidizing agent. But wait, in this problem, the reagent is all that's mentioned. Hmm.

Wait, but the reagent is diazabicyclooctane, which I think is a base. Alternatively, maybe it's used in the formation of epoxides via some other method. Let me think. Oh, wait, the reaction conditions are 403 K, which is about 130°C. That's pretty high, so maybe it's a thermal reaction.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows some specific signals. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has the following signals:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s) → two singlets, each 3H. So that's likely two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe two methyl groups attached to electronegative atoms or in a symmetrical position.

Then, 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So aromatic protons. Let's see, the downfield shifts (like 7.7) suggest substitution in the aromatic ring, maybe ortho or para substituents. The coupling patterns—d for doublet—so perhaps each set is part of an AB system or part of a substituted benzene.

Wait, looking at the multiplicity: 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d,
