Okay, so I need to solve this organic chemistry problem involving sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond along with a sigma bond. Common examples include the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which are pericyclic reactions, usually [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different starting materials and conditions, all under heat and possibly acid. I'll tackle each one step by step.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw its structure. So, ethanamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. Structure is like: (CH3O)2C-NH2. But wait, that's ethan-1-amine with two methoxy groups on the 1st carbon.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2CH2OH? No, wait. But-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2. No, but that's but-2-en-2-ol. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol structure. Let me think: but is four carbons. 3-en means double bond between C3 and C4. So structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, double bond is between C3 and C4. So structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

But-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4, so the structure is CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, but butane is four carbons. So positions are 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that would be but-2-en-3-ol
