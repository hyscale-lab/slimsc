Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think aloud.

The question is about the reaction of ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, the researcher checked the TLC and saw the reactant spot diminish, with two new spots. So, I need to figure out what the products are from the given options.

First, let me draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking it down: the benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached. The other part is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons.

But that's but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but but has four carbons. So numbering starts from the point of attachment. So, the structure is:

O

O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, but-3-en is impossible because but has four carbons, so the double bond can be at 1-2 or 2-3 positions. Oh wait, I think I got the structure wrong. Let me re-examine.

But-3-en-1-yl: The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? But but has only four carbons. So the positions would be 1, 2, 3, 4. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. But that would make it a terminal double bond, which is possible. So the structure would be CH2CH2CHCH2, but no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the enyl group. So the group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl: the
