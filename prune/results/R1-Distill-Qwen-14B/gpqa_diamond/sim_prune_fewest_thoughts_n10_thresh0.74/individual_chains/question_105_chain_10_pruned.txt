Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun. It has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the star's surface is covered in these spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K.

The situation is observed through photometric time-series data, and because the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The interesting part is that this can look similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, which also causes a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: If the star wasn't covered by spots, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

So, the key here is to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar, where Rpl is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

I remember that the transit method for exoplanets works by measuring the dip in brightness when the planet passes in front of the star. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the areas of the planet and the star.

The formula for the dip in brightness (ΔF) when a planet transits is approximately:

ΔF ≈ (Rpl / Rstar)^2

Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots, which complicates things. So the observed variation isn't just due to the planet but due to the spots rotating in and out of view.

Wait, the star is observed to have brightness variations because spots cover one hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the spots come into view more or less, causing the light curve to vary.

So the amplitude of the variation is due to the change in the star's brightness as the spots rotate. But the problem states that this effect is similar to an exoplanet transit. So, the amplitude from the spots must be equivalent to the amplitude from a planet transit.

But wait, how do the spots affect the brightness? Spots are cooler regions, so when they are on the visible hemisphere, the star appears dimmer than when they're not visible.

So when the star is viewed with spots on the side facing us, the overall brightness is lower because a fraction of the surface is cooler. As the star rotates, more or less of the spots are visible, causing the brightness to change.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 5000K. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the surface is at 5000K, and 80% at 6000K.

So the total flux from the star without spots would be higher than the flux with spots. But when the spots are on the far side, their effect is not seen, so the star appears brighter.

Wait, no, the filling factor affects the observed brightness. Let me think about the flux.
