Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function of a system with three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Wait, β is 1/(kT), so actually it's e^(-E/(kT)) = e^(-β E). So each state contributes a term based on its energy.

First, I should figure out all possible states. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states.

Wait, the energy depends on the product of each pair. Let's think about what S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3 evaluate to. Each product can be either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are aligned or opposite.

Let me consider how the energy E looks. E = -J (sum of the three products). So for each state, I calculate the sum of the three pairwise products, multiply by -J, and that's E.

But maybe instead of looking at individual states, I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Because each term is ±1, the sum can vary.

How many possible values can the sum have? Let me think. Each term is ±1, so summing three terms:

Possible sums: 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), -3 (all -1). Wait, wait, no. Let me list all possible sums.

Wait, the sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me think of all possible combinations.

Case 1: All three are +1. Then sum is 3.

Case 2: Two +1, one -1. How many ways? Let's see, for each pair.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of +1 and -1 in the products. If all three products are +1, sum is 3.

If two are +1 and one is -1,
