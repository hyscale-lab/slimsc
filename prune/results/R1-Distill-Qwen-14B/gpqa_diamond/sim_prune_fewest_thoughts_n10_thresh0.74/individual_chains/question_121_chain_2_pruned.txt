Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product when a specific epoxide reacts with Me2CuLi. Hmm, epoxide ring opening with organocuprates. Let me think about what I remember from my notes.

Epoxides reacting with nucleophiles... I think the mechanism involves the nucleophile attacking the less substituted carbon because the more substituted one is more hindered. Oh wait, but wait, for epoxides, when they're opened by organocuprates, which are strong nucleophiles, the attack happens at the less hindered carbon. Right, because the cuprate is a strong enough base to deprotonate and form the alkoxide, but in this case, I think the reaction is more about nucleophilic attack.

Wait, the question says that the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. So first, I need to look at the structure of the epoxide given. The compound is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let me try to visualize that structure.

Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means it's a norbornane structure. The numbering is a bit tricky. So position 1 is on one bridgehead, 3 and 4 are on other positions. The oxygen is at position 7, so it's the epoxide oxygen in the norbornane system.

So the epoxide ring is between which carbons? In norbornane, the bridgehead carbons are 1 and 4. Wait, no, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have two bridgeheads. Let me think: the norbornane structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, but this is different. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have a bridge of four carbons, another bridge of one, and another of zero? Wait, no, the numbers are the lengths of the bridges. So for [4.1.0], the three bridge lengths are 4, 1, and 0. Hmm, maybe the structure has a five-membered ring and a two-membered bridge or something else. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to
