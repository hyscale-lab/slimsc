Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, so I think the blue complex is probably the one with two SCN- ligands, right? Because I remember that Co(SCN)_n complexes have different colors based on n. So the dithiocyanato would be the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^something.

Stability constants are given, so this is a log K question. Stability constants tell us about the stability of complexes. Higher beta means more stable. So for each complex, the formation constant βn is given.

Wait, but how do we calculate the percentage of a particular complex in the solution when multiple complexes can form? I think it involves using the formation constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The general approach for this kind of problem is to consider all possible complexes and calculate their concentrations. Then, the percentage of each complex is found by dividing its concentration by the total concentration of all complexes and the free ions.

But wait, the total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M. That should be the sum of all the species: [Co^2+ ] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But I'm not sure about the exact charges. Wait, each SCN- contributes a -1 charge. So for Co^2+:

- [Co(SCN)]+ would be Co^2+ + SCN^-: charge is 2+ + (-1) = +1. So that's n=1.

- [Co(SCN)_2]: 2*(-1) + 2+ = 0, so neutral.
