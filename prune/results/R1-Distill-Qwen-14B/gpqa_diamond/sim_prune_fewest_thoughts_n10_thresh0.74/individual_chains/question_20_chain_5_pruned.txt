Okay, so I've got this physics question here about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is a way to simplify things by treating nucleons as if they're free particles. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's think this through.

The question is asking which assumptions jointly imply this "impulse" approximation when considering some interaction, like electroweak. There are four assumptions, and four options to choose from.

The four assumptions are numbered 1 to 4. Let me read them again:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

Okay, so the impulse approximation assumes that nucleons behave as free particles. That means their motion isn't affected much by the other nucleons in the nucleus. So, if that's the case, which of these assumptions lead to that?

Let me go one by one.

Assumption 1: Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So it's like each nucleon is treated separately, not considering their interactions with each other. That sounds like it's part of the impulse approximation because it treats each nucleon as a free particle, not influenced by others.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. Transparency here probably refers to the idea that other nucleons don't affect the interaction. So, when a particle interacts with the nucleus, only one nucleon is involved, and the rest are like not there. So this would lead to the idea that the nucleon is free, as others don't influence it. So assumption 2 supports the impulse approximation.

Assumption 3: Quarks in the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, quarks are part of the nucleon. If the quarks are non-relativistic, does that affect the approximation? I think the impulse approximation is more about the motion of the nucleon as a whole. If the internal parts (quarks) are non-relativistic, maybe it's about treating the nucleon as a point particle without considering internal dynamics. But does this directly lead to the assumption of being free particles? Or is it more about the approximation in terms of how the nucleon behaves during the interaction?

Alternatively, maybe this assumption is about the fact that the binding forces are weak, so the nucleon's structure isn't much affected. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think about the others first.

Assumption 4: The interaction is as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Binding forces are the forces that hold the nucleus together, like the strong nuclear force. If the nucleon is treated as if it's not bound, then it's moving freely, right? So this definitely supports the impulse approximation. Because if there's no binding, it's free.

Now, the question is which combination of these assumptions imply the impulse approximation.

The impulse approximation is when the nucleus is treated as a collection of free nucleons, so the other nucleons don't affect the interaction.

So, for that to happen, the interaction can't see the other nucleons (so
