Alright, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and some gene mutation. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the scenario is that there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. That compound is causing it to not be usable for food. They found the gene responsible for synthesizing this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns.

They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and then they sequenced the target gene in all mutants. Some changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. The question is which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, so presumably, this would disrupt the gene's function.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the sequence. I need to figure out which mutation leads to a loss of function of the gene, which would stop the compound from being made.

Let me think about how genes work. The gene is made up of exons and introns, so the exons are the coding regions. The first exon is where the changes are. The sequence given is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this.

Mutations can be point mutations or larger changes. Let's look at each mutant.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
So the first part is ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then TTT... etc.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, the sixth nucleotide is T changed to C (since the third part: the original is TTT, mutant 1 is TCT. So the third codon would be TTT → TCT? Let's see:

Original: positions 4-6 are TTT → in mutant 1, positions 4-6: TCT? Wait, the first three are ATG, then next triplet: TTT for the original, but in mutant1 it's TCT. So first six nucleotides:

Original: ATG TTT

Mutant1: ATG TCT

Wait, no. Let me count. The original is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT… TGA.

Wait, let me write out the first part:

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant1:
ATG TCT ACG CTC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC ... TGA

Wait, looking at the sequences: The first part in mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

So comparing to the intact first part:
