Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm, I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important for renormalizability. If the theory is renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling constants can't be higher than a certain value, which I think is 4 in 4-dimensional spacetime.

Wait, the Lagrangian is in four dimensions, right? Because typically we talk about four-dimensional spacetime for such theories. So each field and coupling has a certain mass dimension, and the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because it's integrated over d^4x. So the terms in the Lagrangian must each have mass dimension 4.

So to find the dimension of κ, I need to compute the dimensions of each part of the term and then solve for κ.

Let me break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I know that ψ is a Dirac spinor. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2 because the Lagrangian term for the Dirac field is something like i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so ψ must be dimension 3/2 because (3/2)*2 +1 = 4? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the term i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ has dimension 4 because the Lagrangian's terms must have dimension 4 to integrate properly in 4D. So ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2 because when you multiply them, 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, and then the derivative adds 1, making 4. So yes, ψ has dimension 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν} is (i/2) [γ_mu, γ_nu], which is an antisymmetric tensor built from gamma matrices. Since each γ matrix is dimensionless (they're just matrices), σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So the σ_{μν} term doesn't affect the dimension here.

Then, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Or wait, F^{μν} is typically from a gauge field, like A_mu. The field strength F is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each A_mu has dimension 1, since ∂ has dimension 1, and F^{μν} would be [∂ A], so F has dimension 2.

Wait, let me confirm. The gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1 because the field strength F_{μν} is built from derivatives of A, which would have dimension
