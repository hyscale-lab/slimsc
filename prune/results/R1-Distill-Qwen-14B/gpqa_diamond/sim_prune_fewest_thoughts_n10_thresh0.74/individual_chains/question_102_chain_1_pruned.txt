Okay, so I've got this question about a molecular biology experiment, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The experiment involves creating a bicistronic vector with both the ligand and receptor ORFs, using loxP and IRES elements, and then looking for expression in mice. They used antibodies against the proteins and tested via Western blot. Then they bred mice and used SOX10-Cre to see expression under a confocal microscope, but the green signal (from eGFP) wasn't observed. Why?

First, let me parse the setup. The construct is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs in one vector. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand's promoter is CBA, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. So the vector probably looks something like: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF (with stop in loxP cassette) -> mCherry, then IRES -> receptor ORF -> eGFP with a stop in lox2272 cassette.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the vector setup. Bicistronic vectors often have a promoter, then two ORFs with either internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or 2A peptide sequences to allow both to be expressed. Here, between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. That suggests that normally, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but with the stop cassette, maybe they're using Cre to excise the stop so ligand is expressed as a separate protein with mCherry being downstream? Or perhaps mCherry is a reporter.

The receptor is under IRES, which usually allows it to be expressed as a separate protein, perhaps in a different way. So the vector might be designed such that in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed separately, each with their fluorescent tags.

Now, the Western blot was done using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They saw a signal proportional to actin, which suggests the blot is working (since actin is a loading control and has a consistent signal). So the antibodies are working, and the proteins are being expressed, maybe.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Why SOX10-Cre? SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably under the control of SOX10 regulatory elements, meaning it's active in neural crest cells and their derivatives.

The offspring were born, and they visualized them under confocal. They looked for green signal, which would come from eGFP. But they didn't see it. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same construct. Wait, but the vector is designed to express both ligand and receptor. If they're in a paracrine relationship, maybe the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But why would that prevent eGFP expression? If the construct is in the same cell, then both proteins should be expressed.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So the eGFP isn't getting to the cell surface, thus no fluorescence. But would the Western blot pick up the receptor? Because the Western blot uses antibodies against the proteins, regardless of their localization. So if the receptor is made but stuck in Golgi, you'd still see it on the blot. But in the question, the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. So in that case, maybe the construct isn't properly processed. But the question says they used the antibodies to test expression, and the total proteins give a signal proportional to actin. So perhaps the proteins are expressed but not functional? Hmm, but the problem is that in the mouse model, they didn't see the eGFP under the microscope. Maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the construct isn't properly processed.

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. If the enhancer is missing, the promoters might not be active, leading to no expression. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which usually requires a preceding ORF to be translated, but I'm not sure. Wait, IRES elements are used to allow internal initiation of translation without needing a
