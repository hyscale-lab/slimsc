Okay, so I've got this question about isomers, specifically optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism means the compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbons, bonded to four different groups. So the question is asking which of the four given organic compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. The options are 1, 2, 3, 4, and the possible answers are combinations of these.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1', so the structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, which are the positions adjacent to the connecting bond. The substituents are carboxylate groups (since it's the dicarboxylate ester), and there are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions.

Wait, so looking at the biphenyl structure, the substituents are in positions that might create a chiral center. But wait, the biphenyls are connected in a way that perhaps allows the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that create a chiral center at the central carbon.

Wait, no, the central point is where the two benzene rings are connected. So each benzene ring has substituents. Let's imagine the structure: each benzene ring has a carboxylate ester group (OOCR) at position 2, and a nitro group at position 6. So each benzene ring has a substituent at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, but the biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1', so the numbering is such that each ring has substituents at 2, 6, and the other ring has substituents at 2' and 6'. Hmm, but does that make any of the carbons on the rings chiral?

Wait, no, all the substituents on the benzene rings are in positions that are symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon (the bridge between the two rings) is a chiral center. Wait, the bridge is a single bondâ€”the two benzene rings are connected by a carbon
