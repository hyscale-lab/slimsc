Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, no, wait—matrix elements are usually complex numbers in quantum mechanics, but here it's given as (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, maybe those are just real numbers. So the state vector is a 3x1 matrix (since P and Q are 3x3 matrices) with components [-1, 2, 1]. But I should probably normalize this vector because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are unit vectors. So I need to check if it's already normalized.

Let me calculate the norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which means the state isn't normalized. But wait, in the problem statement, it's given as the state, so perhaps I should normalize it first before proceeding. Or maybe the question has a typo and the components are supposed to be something else. Well, I'll proceed with the given vector but keep in mind that it's not normalized yet.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the state is (-1, 2, 1) as a column matrix. Let me compute the magnitude. The square of the magnitude is 1 +4 +1=6, so the magnitude is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector must be this divided by sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. 

Next, the operators P and Q are given. Let me look at operator P's matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, that's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P =
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0;
1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2);
0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

And operator Q is given as:

Q =
[1, 0, 0;
0, 0, 0;
0, 0, -1]

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, and -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So the eigenvector for eigenvalue 1 is [1,0,0], for 0 it's [0,1,0], and for -1 it's [0,0,1].

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q, right after measuring P. So, the process is first measure P, then measure Q after that.

Wait,
