Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. 

The parameters given are the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. Oh wait, so it's a rhombohedral structure, which means all the edges are of equal length and all the angles are the same. So this is a special case of a hexagonal or maybe a cubic crystal? No, wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal? Or is it a separate category? I'm a bit confused there, but I think for this problem, the key thing is the formula for interplanar distance.

I think the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a crystal is given by something involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters. Oh right, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk)(cos α + cos β + cos γ)/a² + ... ) Wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. Let me try to recall.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is derived from the Miller indices (hkl) and the lattice parameters. For a cubic system, the formula is simple, like d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for non-cubic systems, like rhombohedral, the formula is more complicated. 

In a rhombohedral system, since all the edges are equal and the angles are equal, perhaps the formula simplifies a bit. I think the general formula for any triclinic system is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) - 2(il cos β)/(b c) - 2(lk cos α)/(a c) ) ), where a, b, c are the lattice parameters, and alpha, beta, gamma are the angles between the axes. 

But in this case, a = b = c because it's rhombohedral. So each of the a, b, c is the same, let's say a, and all angles
