Okay, let's try to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll walk through each step carefully.

So, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? The structure is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So, the first step is treating it with bromine. What does that do?

Wait, bromine in a reaction with a ketone. Oh right, I think the bromine would add across the carbonyl group. Because ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So cyclohexanone (O=C-C5H10) reacting with Br2. I think it's a bromohydrin formation or maybe a dibromide. Wait, no, wait. When ketones react with Br2, it's usually a diaddition. So, the carbonyl oxygen is attacked by Br, and then another Br adds? Or, wait, maybe it's an addition across the double bond if it's an enol. No, wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone, so it's R-CO-R. So, the reaction would be the bromine adding to the carbonyl, making a geminal dihalide. So product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The carbonyl group is O=C-R. Adding Br2 would add two bromine atoms across the carbony
