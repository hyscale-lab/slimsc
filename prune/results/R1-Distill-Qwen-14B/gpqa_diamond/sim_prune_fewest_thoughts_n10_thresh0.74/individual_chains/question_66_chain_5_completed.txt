Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think it's a framework where you take the Standard Model and add higher-dimensional operators, which are terms that are suppressed by some high energy scale, like the Planck scale. These operators are organized by their dimensionality—so dimension-6, dimension-8, etc.

Now, the symmetries. Let me go through each one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: That's the symmetry of special relativity, right? It includes rotations and boosts. All the terms in the theory should respect this because relativity is a fundamental part of our understanding of physics. So any operator in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant. So 1 is definitely a must.

2. Poincare symmetry: That's actually a bigger symmetry group. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So it's like the full symmetry of spacetime. If a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, wait. In SMEFT, do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it somehow separate?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Because Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare. If a theory is Poincare invariant, it's automatically Lorentz invariant. But does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? I think SMEFT is based on the Standard Model, which respects Poincare. So all operators in SMEFT should respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 would be correct.

Wait, but the question is which must be respected by all operators. So if all operators are part of a theory that respects Poincare, then their individual terms must respect it as well. But wait, no, operators are built from SM fields, so maybe they automatically respect Lorentz because they're built from fields that transform under the Lorentz group. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Poincare symmetry is more about the entire theory, not individual operators. Or perhaps the operators are constructed to be Lorentz invariant, but not necessarily considering translations. Or maybe the SMEFT framework includes Poincare symmetry in the same way the SM does.

Wait, but Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if a theory respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz. So if all operators must respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But in the options, options A and C include both 1 and 2.

But the question is which must be respected by all operators. So if operators are allowed to break Poincare symmetry, but not Lorentz, that wouldn't make sense. Wait, no. Because the entire theory must respect Poincare. So each operator must be a part of that. So each operator would have to respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are required?

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4. So the question is whether the operators must respect Poincare symmetry. I'm a bit shaky on this. Let me think about how SMEFT is constructed. SMEFT is the effective theory, so all terms are built as Lorentz-invariant, just like the SM. The SM respects Poincare, so the SMEFT operators must as well. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, and also a Poincare scalar.

Alternatively, maybe Poincare is a larger symmetry, so if the theory is Poincare invariant, all the terms must be Poincare-invariant, which includes being Lorentz-invariant. So if the SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry, then the operators must respect it. But perhaps in the question, it's whether the operators individually must respect each symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the Poincare symmetry isn't something that's imposed on each operator, but rather on the entire theory. Hmm, not sure. Maybe that's a red herring, but the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators, not the theory as a whole.

I think in the SMEFT, each operator is a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected. But Poincare symmetry (2) is about the whole theory's invariance under spacetime translations, which is a global symmetry. So perhaps each operator doesn't need to respect it individually, but the sum does. So maybe the operators don't have to individually satisfy Poincare symmetry, but the whole Lagrangian does. So perhaps the answer doesn't include Poincare, meaning 2 isn't required for each operator. So only Lorentz (1), and perhaps CP and CPT.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries all operators must respect. So perhaps the operators must be scalars under Lorentz (so 1 is correct) but not necessarily under Poincare, because that's a global symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of what SMEFT operators are. SMEFT operators are built as products of SM fields, arranged to be renormalizable terms but with higher dimension. They must be Lorentz scalars, because the theory is Lorentz invariant. So 1 is correct.

Now, what about Poincare? Poincare includes translations, which are global symmetries. The operators don't have to be invariant under translations by themselves; the entire Lagrangian must be, but individual terms (operators) can vary. For example, in the SM, each term in the Lagrangian isn't necessarily invariant under translations, but the sum is. So for operators in SMEFT, they just need to be Lorentz scalars, but not necessarily translate-invariant.

So in the question, Poincare symmetry (2) is not something each operator must individually respect. So the correct symmetries that each operator must respect are Lorentz (1), and perhaps others.

Moving on to 3: CP symmetry. CP is Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general, as seen in processes like kaon mixing. So in SMEFT, operators could in principle break CP. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily a symmetry that all SMEFT operators must respect. So 3 is incorrect.

4. CPT symmetry: This is a bigger symmetry combining C, P, and T. In any Lorentz invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold, because the combination is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (4). Because if the theory is Lorentz invariant, it must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all operators respect?

1. Lorentz: yes.

2. Poincare: no, because individual operators don't need to be translation invariant; the whole Lagrangian must be.

3. CP: no, operators can break CP.

4. CPT: yes.

So the correct symmetries are 1 and 4.

Wait, looking at the options: option C is 1,2,4; option D is 1,3,4. None of the options has 1 and 4. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

Wait, but I thought 1 and 4 are correct. So none of the options has only 1 and 4. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got Poincare wrong. Let's think again. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation. But the operators are part of the effective theory, so the entire Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar and also a scalar under translations. Because when you add them together, the sum must be translation invariant.

Wait, but each operator is a term in the Lagrangian. So each term must be a scalar under translations because the Lagrangian is translation invariant. Wait, no. The Lagrangian density is a function of spacetime, and under translations, each term would change, but when integrated over spacetime, the total action is invariant. Wait, but each term in the Lagrangian is a scalar, but that's a local statement. Wait, no, the Lagrangian is a scalar density.

Wait, perhaps each operator (term) must be a scalar under the Poincare group. Because the terms are part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar density. So each term must be a scalar under Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translations. So then, 2 (Poincare) must be respected by each operator. So operator must be a Poincare scalar, which implies they're Lorentz scalars as well. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

But that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. So if each operator must be a Poincare scalar, then both 1 and 2 are correct.

In that case, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 4 (CPT) must be respected as well. Because the theory is Lorentz invariant, which implies CPT symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify:

Because the theory is Lorentz invariant, it must also be CPT invariant. So all operators must be such that the theory respects CPT. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together: 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) must be respected by all operators.

Wait, but why must the operators respect Poincare? Because the entire theory is Poincare invariant. Each operator is a term in the Lagrangian, which is a scalar under Poincare. So each operator must transform as a scalar under Poincare, meaning they must be Poincare scalars. So 2 is correct.

Thus, the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. Which would be option C.

Wait, but wait. Are Poincare symmetry and Lorentz symmetry considered separately? Because Poincare includes Lorentz. So if the operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So in the options, if 2 is included, 1 is automatically covered. But in the question, the options have 1 and 2 as separate, so if the right answer includes 2, it would include 1 as well.

In my earlier analysis, I thought that each operator must be a Poincare scalar, so 2 is correct. So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

So the correct option is C) 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me think if CPT is automatically respected. Because any Lorentz invariant theory must be CPT invariant. So if the operator is part of a Lorentz invariant theory, then the operator must respect CPT. So 4 is also correct.

So the correct answer is 1,2,4, which is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian, which are suppressed by a high energy scale. These operators are organized by their dimensionality and must respect certain symmetries. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is the symmetry of special relativity, encompassing rotations and boosts. All operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars because the theory is Lorentz invariant. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. While Lorentz symmetry applies to individual operators, Poincaré symmetry is a global symmetry that applies to the entire theory. Each operator in the Lagrangian must be a Poincaré scalar to ensure the theory is Poincaré invariant. Thus, Poincaré symmetry (2) must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry in general, and operators in SMEFT are not required to preserve CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Since SMEFT is Lorentz invariant, all operators must respect CPT symmetry (4).

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
