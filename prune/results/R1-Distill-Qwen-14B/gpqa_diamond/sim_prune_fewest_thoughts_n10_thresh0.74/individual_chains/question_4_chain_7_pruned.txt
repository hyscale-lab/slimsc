Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where a magnet can have isolated North or South poles. The question is asking which of Maxwell's equations would look different. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, in our universe, magnets have both North and South poles; you can't have just one. I remember that this is related to one of Maxwell's equations. Oh right, Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition. No, wait, which equation specifically?

Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me list them out. The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity: divergence of E equals rho/epsilon0. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism: divergence of B is zero. The third is Faraday's Law of induction: curl of E is negative the time derivative of B. The fourth is Ampère's Law: curl of B is mu0 times J plus epsilon0 mu0 times the time derivative of E.

Wait, in our universe, the divergence of B is zero, which ensures that there are no isolated magnetic poles, right? So if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that means the divergence of B isn't zero anymore. So the second equation must be different.

So the equation that would change is the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. Looking at the options:

Option A says the one related to the divergence of B. That would be the second equation. So in this universe, Gauss's Law for magnetism is different.

Wait, but let me think about each option. The question is which of Maxwell's equations are different. So only one equation changes, right?

Wait, the options have more than one possibility. Let me read the options again.

Option A: The one related to divergence of B. So that's the second equation.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of E (Faraday's Law) and divergence of B. So if both these equations change? But why would Faraday's Law change? Hmm.

Wait, in our universe, because B has divergence zero, that affects how B behaves. If B can have divergence, then that would change Gauss's Law for magnetism. But Faraday's Law is about the curl of E, which is about changing B fields. So if B has sources, how does that affect E?

Wait, having isolated magnetic charges would change the equations. Let me think: Maxwell's equations when magnetic monopoles exist. I remember that when magnetic monopoles are present, the divergence of B is not zero anymore. The equation becomes divergence of B equals rho_m / mu0 (where rho_m is the magnetic charge density). So this affects the second equation.

But what about the other equations? Faraday's Law would also change, I think. Because if you have magnetic current, then the curl of E would have another term. Because in Faraday's Law, the curl of E is -dB/dt. But if there are magnetic currents, there might be an additional term.

Wait, normally, the equation is ∫ E · dl = -dΦ_B/dt. But if magnetic monopoles exist, then there's also a term for the magnetic current. So the equation would include a term related to the magnetic current density. So Faraday's Law would change as well.

So in the modified Maxwell's equations, both the divergence of B
