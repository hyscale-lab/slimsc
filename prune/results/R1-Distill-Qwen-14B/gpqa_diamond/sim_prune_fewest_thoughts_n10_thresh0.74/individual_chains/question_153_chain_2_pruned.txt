Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts: (A), (B), and (C). Each involves different reactants and reagents, and I need to determine the major products.

Starting with part (A):
The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). NaOEt is a strong base, so this probably deprotonates the alpha position of the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate would act as a nucleophile.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CHâ€“, right? So when deprotonated, the enolate would be at the central carbon. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. The structure should be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituents might be different. Oh, wait, it's methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. Wait, no, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is on the third carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3-position is where the p-tolyl is attached. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or perhaps the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2
