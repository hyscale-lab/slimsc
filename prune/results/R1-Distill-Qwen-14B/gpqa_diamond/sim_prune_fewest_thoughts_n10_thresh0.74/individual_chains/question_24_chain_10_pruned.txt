Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's take it step by step. The question is about some reactions involving mixtures of liquids and their hydrogenation. Let me try to parse all the information given.

First, there's a mixture X, which is equimolar of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has unsaturated bonds, like double or triple bonds, because bromine (Br2) adds across them. So, mixture X's components must have some unsaturated bonds.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. The products of Y don't decolorize bromine water anymore. So Y's components don't have double or triple bonds anymore. That suggests that the reaction in X's formation of Y is adding hydrogen, maybe.

When both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which I can convert to find the molecular formula. Also, Z is part of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Since Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, it's probably a fully saturated molecule, no more double bonds to hydrogenate.

Let me think about the data. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. Let me calculate that. So hydrogen makes up 14.28% of Z's mass. Let's assume the molar mass of Z is M. The mass contributed by hydrogen is (number of H atoms * 1) / M = 0.1428.

Wait, let's write it as a formula. Let’s say Z has n H atoms. Then:

(n * 1) / M = 0.1428

But I don't know M yet. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the empirical formula. Let's see, if the mass of H is 14.28%, which is roughly 1/7, then the fraction of carbon and hydrogen in Z is probably something like C3H8 or similar.

Wait, let me calculate:

Suppose Z has a molecular formula CxHy. The mass of H is (y * 1) / (12x + y) = 0.1428. Let me rearrange this:

y / (12x + y) = 1/7

Multiply both sides by denominator: y = (12x + y)/7

Multiply both sides by 7: 7y = 12x + y → 6y =12x → y=2x.

So the ratio is y=2x. So the formula is CxH2x.

Now, for a hydrocarbon, the possible formulas. Let's think of common solvents. Maybe something like hexane (C6H14), but wait, for hexane, y=14, x=6 → y=14, which is 2x + 2, so that doesn't fit y=2x. Hmm. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, the equation after cross-multiplying was 7y = 12x + y → 6y =12x → y=2x. So the ratio is y=2x.

So for example, if x is 3, y is 6 → C3H6, which is propene, but that's an alkene, but in Y, after hydrogenation, Z doesn't have any more double bonds. Wait, but Z is formed by hydrogenation of Y, which doesn't have any double bonds. So Z must be fully saturated, like an alkane. So maybe I made a mistake in the earlier assumption.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. So Z is formed by hydrogenating both X and Y. But Y doesn't have any double bonds, so hydrogen
