Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given a specific state. Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about uncertainties and operators in quantum mechanics.

The uncertainty ΔP_z is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I think this is a 3-component vector, so it's in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. The operators P_x, P_y, P_z are given as matrices. 

First, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. That's the state multiplied by P_z matrix multiplied by the state's conjugate transpose. Wait, but the state is given as a column vector. So I'll probably do it like ψ† P_z ψ.

Wait, let me write down the matrices to make things clear. 

The matrix for P_z is:
[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So when I calculate ⟨P_z⟩, I'll multiply the state vector (as a row vector, the conjugate transpose) with P_z matrix, then multiply by the state vector.

But wait, the state is given as a column vector. So to get ⟨P_z⟩, it's ψ† P_z ψ.

Let me write the state as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
        1/√2
        -1/2 ]

So ψ† is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Now, let's compute P_z ψ. Each element is the dot product of each row of P_z with ψ.

First element: (ħ)(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) ) = -ħ/2.

Second element: 0*(-1/2) +
