Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with the Boltzmann equation and the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. I remember that the population of different energy levels in atoms is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula I learned is something like N_upper/N_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, star_1 has twice as excited atoms. So, the ratio of the populations for star_1 (n1) and star_2 (n2) is 2:1. Or wait, no, wait: is it the number of excited atoms or the ratio of excited to lower states? The question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the excitation is higher, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy level. So for each star, the ratio of the upper level (U) to the lower level (L) is given by Boltzmann's equation.

So, for each star, U/L = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for star_1, U1/L1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). For star_2, U2/L2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So perhaps U1/L1 = 2 * (U2/L2). Because if star_1's atoms are twice as excited, then the ratio of upper to lower states is twice that of star_2. 

Wait, that makes sense. So we have:

U1/L1 = 2 * (U2/L2)

But using the Boltzmann equation, U1/L1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and U2/L2=exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So substituting, exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Hmm. Let's write that equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Taking natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Let me rearrange that:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me compute the left side again. The equation after taking logs is:

- ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Adding ΔE/(k T2) to both sides and adding ΔE/(k T1) to both sides:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T
