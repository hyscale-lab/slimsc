Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, Compound A is C3H6. I remember that the molecular formula C3H6 can correspond to either propene or cyclopropane. But wait, propene is more common and usually involved in such reactions. So I think A is propene, which is CH2=CH2CH3? Or wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3, right. Because C3H6 has a double bond, so it's an alkene.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, right, when alkenes react with bromine (Br2), it's a diaddition. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacting with Br2 would add a bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, or is it 1,3-dibromopropane? No, wait, the bromine adds across the double bond. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 in propene. So adding Br across that would give BrCH2CHBrCH3. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. This sounds like an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent bromines) react with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation, which is elimination. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, reacting with KOH would remove H and Br from adjacent carbons, forming an alkene. The product would be propene again? Wait, but that's the same as compound A. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's a different product. Oh wait, I'm thinking about the mechanism. So, for 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with KOH in ethanol, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

But wait, the structure is Br-CH2-CHBr-CH3. So the possible β hydrogens are on the adjacent carbons. Removing H
