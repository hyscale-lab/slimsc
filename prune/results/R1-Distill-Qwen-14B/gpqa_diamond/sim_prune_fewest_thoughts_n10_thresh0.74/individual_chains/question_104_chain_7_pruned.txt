Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down. 

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Two stars, each with the same mass as the Sun, have planets similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method relates the star's velocity to the planet's mass and orbital characteristics. The formula that comes to mind is the one for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, K, which is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(something) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(2/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version. Since the planets are similar to Neptune, their masses are much smaller than the stars, so M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so the equation simplifies.

The formula I think is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/2) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1) )^(1/3) )) ) / (something else? Maybe I'm mixing up the exponents.)

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the semi-major axis. Another approach: using Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the context of the radial velocity method. Let me think. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:
