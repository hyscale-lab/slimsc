Okay, so I have this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

So, each spin S can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z, which is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each state. So each term is exp(-βE), where E is the energy of that state.

First, I need to find all possible states of the system. Since each spin has two possible values, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let's list them:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

For each of these, I'll calculate the energy E and then compute the Boltzmann factor.

Let me calculate the energy E for each state.

The energy E is -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term.

State 1: All +1s.
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum: 3
E = -J * 3.

Boltzmann factor: exp(β * J * 3) because E is -3J. Because Z term is exp(-βE) = exp(3Jβ)

State 2: S3=-1.
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1
E = -J*(-1) = J.

Boltzmann factor: exp(-β * J) since E is J. So exp(-Jβ).

State 3: S2=-1.
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1
E = J.

Boltzmann factor: exp(-Jβ).

State 4: S2=-1, S3=-1.
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1
E = J.

Boltzmann factor: exp(-Jβ).

State 5: S1=-1.
S1S2=(-1)*1=-1
S1S3=(-1)*1=-1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1
E = J.

Boltzmann factor: exp(-Jβ).

State 6: S1=-1, S3=-1.
S1S2=(-1)*1=-1
S1S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1
E = J.

Boltzmann factor: exp(-Jβ).

State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1.
S1S2=(-1)*(-1)=1
S1S3=(-1)*1=-1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1
E = J.

Boltzmann factor: exp(-Jβ).

State 8: All -1s.
S1S2=1
S1S3=1
S2S3=1
Sum:3
E = -J *3.

Boltzmann factor: exp(3Jβ).

Wait, so let me tally up how many states contribute to each Boltzmann factor.

Looking at the states:

- State 1 and 8 contribute exp(3Jβ). So two terms.

- The remaining six states (2,3,4,5,6,7) each contribute exp(-Jβ). So six terms.

Wait, no wait. Let me double-check:

Wait, State 2 has E = J, so exp(-Jβ).

Same for states 3,4,5,6,7. So that's 6 states contributing exp(-Jβ).

States 1 and 8: E = -3J, so exp(3Jβ), so two terms.

So the partition function Z is:

Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ).

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^(Jβ). No, that's opposite exponents.

Option B: 2e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-J
