Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, I remember that the energy of light is related to its wavelength, and different colors correspond to different energies. The question gives the energy emitted as 2.3393 eV, and I need to find out which color is absorbed. Wait, wait—wait, no, actually, when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. But the question is about the color absorbed. Oh, right! That's because when a dye absorbs certain wavelengths, it doesn't emit them, so the complementary color is what we see. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

So, the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. That energy is probably the energy gap between the excited state and the ground state. But wait, when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited. So the absorbed light's energy corresponds to the energy gap. The emitted light, like fluorescence, would have energy lower than the absorbed? Or maybe not. Wait, no—when a dye emits light, that's typically after it's been excited. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted one. Because when you get excited (higher energy state), and then you emit a photon when you go back, losing some energy.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light of 2.3393 eV. So that emission would correspond to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. But the absorption would have been at a higher energy, right? Because you absorb a photon to get excited, which requires
