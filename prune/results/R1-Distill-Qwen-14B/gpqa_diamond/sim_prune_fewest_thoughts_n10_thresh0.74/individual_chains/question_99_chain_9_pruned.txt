Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me look at the question again. The compound has been analyzed using FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The NMR data includes several signals, none of which are vinyl hydrogens, and two specific splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, okay. So, let's break down the IR data first. A broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 usually indicates an -OH group, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower than the typical O-H stretch for carboxylic acids, which is usually around 2500-3300, but the broadness suggests it's an -OH. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is a carbonyl group. So combining these, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because they have both a carbonyl (C=O) and an -OH group. Alternatively, maybe an ester, but the broad peak would be more for an acid. Let me check the options to see what's available.

Looking at the options:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

All options end with either CH2COOH or COOH. So they're all either substituted propanoic acids or butanoic acids, perhaps. So yes, the IR suggests a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, which rules out any double bonds or aromatic rings. So the structure doesn't have any unsaturated bonds.

The NMR has two complex splitting patterns. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. These splitting patterns suggest that the respective protons are each coupling with multiple sets of neighboring protons.

Let's think about the structures. Each option has a central part (the part before the COOH) that's a substituted carbon chain. Let me draw them out or at least visualize.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH
So the chain is CH3 attached to a CH which is connected to two C2H5 groups. Then CH2COOH. Wait, no, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)... so maybe it's a geminal substitution. Like, CH3-C(C2H5)-C(C2H5)-CH2COOH? Or perhaps more accurately, perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2... no, wait, each C(H) is attached to two substituents. Wait, perhaps it's a 2,2-dimethylbutanoic acid or something similar.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each structure. Let me try to imagine each:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. Hmm, so the main chain is perhaps four carbons before the COOH, with
