Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, let me think. I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, if a molecule has such a center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1, and the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Since it's a biphenyl, I'm thinking about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, so maybe that makes the molecule symmetrical? Or maybe it's asymmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion or some symmetry that would prevent chirality. Hmm, wait, but more importantly, does any carbon here have four different groups attached?

Wait, the structure is a biphenyl with two nitro groups at 6,6' and two ester groups (from the dimethyl ester) at 2,2'. So the central carbon might not be a carbon but the point where the two benzene rings connect. That point isn't a carbon, so maybe the chiral centers are elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe each ester group is attached to a carbon that's connected to OMe, O, two carbonyl groups, and a benzene ring. Wait, the ester is OMe attached to a carbonyl. So the ester is OMe-O-C-O-, but wait, the actual carbons would be in the ester group. Let me think about the structure. The dicarboxylate is OMe-O-C-O-C-... Hmm, maybe each of the ester carbonyl carbons (the ones attached to the oxygen) would be attached to four different groups.

Wait, the ester group is OMe-O-C-O-C-O-... No, wait, the ester is R-O-C-O-R'. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to OMe,
