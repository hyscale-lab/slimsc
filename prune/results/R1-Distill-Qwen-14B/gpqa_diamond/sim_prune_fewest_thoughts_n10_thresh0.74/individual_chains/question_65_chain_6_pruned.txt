Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to choose from the options A to D. Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. But wait, in the presence of H+, maybe it's a protonation step later on.

The starting material looks like a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol. The structure is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached to the oxygen. The spiro rings are probably a 5-membered and a 7-membered ring? Wait, the formula is spiro[3.5], so the rings are 4 and 6 membered? Because spiro[m.n] refers to the number of carbons in each ring, but when you count, it's m+1 and n+1? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. Spiro[3.5]non... non has nine carbons. Hmm, maybe the rings are 4 and 6, adding up to 9 plus the two bridge carbons. Not sure, but maybe that's not the main point right now.

The reaction with KH in THF. I recall that strong bases like KH can deprotonate alcohols. But wait, the compound is an alcohol, so it's probably getting deprotonated. But wait, in this case, it's a cyclic ether, perhaps? Or maybe a conjugate base. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, another thought: when a cyclic ether like an epoxide is treated with a strong base, it can open. But this isn't an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement? Or some kind of elimination leading to a carbocation?

Wait, another angle: The compound has a spiro structure with a vinyl group. Perhaps when it's treated with a strong base, it undergoes some kind of cyclization. Let me think about the possible reaction mechanisms.

Wait, the reagent is THF, which is a solvent, and then KH. But wait, H+ is also present. So maybe the process is deprotonation followed by some kind of acid workup.

Wait, another possibility: the alcohol is deprotonated by the strong base (KH is a strong base, so it's a good deprotonating agent), forming an alkoxide. Then, perhaps the alkoxide can undergo some kind of elimination, maybe a conjugate elimination, especially since there's a double bond nearby.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. I think I remember a reaction where certain spiro compounds, when treated with a strong base, undergo a ring-opening or ring-forming process. For example, the Burch reaction or some annulation reactions.

Alternatively, considering the product in
