Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what information I have. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll break down each piece of data step by step.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates O-H stretching. Broad peaks in that region are typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's a very broad peak, perhaps it's from an -OH group in an alcohol or a phenol. But wait, the other peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is usually a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid). The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation.

Wait, but 1650 cm^-1 could also be an aromatic C=C stretch. But the 1700 is a strong peak, so likely a carbonyl. If there are two strong peaks in that region, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Wait, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester where the carbonyl is around 1700, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C. Or maybe it's a conjugated system like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Hmm.

Moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, probably an alkene. So structures with double bonds are possible, like maybe an ester with a double bond nearby.

Now, the mass spectrum. The fragment peak at m/z 45 is interesting. Let me think about what that could correspond to. 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O (which is 15 + 16 + 16 = 47? Wait no, wait: 12 for C, 1 for each H, 16 for O. (CH3)2O is C2H6O, which has a molecular weight of 46 (12*2 +6 +16=24+6+16=46). Wait, 45 is one less. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group. Wait, CH2O is formaldehyde, mass 30. No, 45 is more than that.

Wait, another approach. Let me think of possible fragments. 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but wait, that's higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethylene fragment. Or maybe it's a ketene ion? No, maybe that's not it.

Wait, wait, 45 is the molecular ion of something like CH3COOH (32 for CH3COO is 59?) Let me calculate:

Wait, CH3COOH is C2H4O2. Molecular weight: 2*12=24, 4*1=4, 2*16=32. Total 24+4=28 +32=60. So the molecular ion would be 60. But the question has a fragment at 45. So maybe a fragment of 45 comes from losing some parts.

Alternatively, 45 could be C3H9O+. Let's calculate that: 3*12=36, 9=9, 16=16. 36+9=45 +16=61. So that wouldn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait another approach: 45 is the mass of (CH3)2CHO+ (but wait, (CH3)2CHO is 74? No, wait, molecular formula would be C3H6O. So 3*12=36, 6=6, 16=16. 36+6=42 +16=58. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone fragment. Or maybe a smaller group.

Wait, maybe it's the (CH2O) group. Wait, formaldehyde is 30, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2=CH-O- something? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the m/z 45 comes from the loss of something. If the molecular ion is higher, maybe the compound loses a larger group, leaving a smaller fragment.

But maybe I should think about the possible formulas and see which ones fit.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So, I need to figure out which formula fits all the data.

Let me think about the IR first. The broad peak at 3000 likely indicates an -OH group, which would mean at least one O is in an alcohol or phenol group. The 1700 cm^-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. So maybe an ester? Because esters have a carbonyl. Alternatively, a ketone. But if it's an ester, the O would be part of the ester group. Let's consider that.

The IR also has a peak at 1650 cm^-1. For esters, the carbonyl is around 1740, but conjugation can lower that. Alternatively, if it's an aromatic ring, that peak might be for C=C. Alternatively, a conjugated ester (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester) would have a lower carbonyl peak, maybe around 1700. The 1650 could be the conjugated C=C.

So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl (like an ester) and an aromatic ring, but wait, if there's a vinyl group in the NMR, maybe it's an alkene, not necessarily an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with an alkene group nearby. Let's think about possible structures.

Looking at the possible molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X=0, N=0. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. Could be a ring or a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present, so that would account for one degree of unsaturation. So perhaps that's a possibility.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees: (14 -10)/2=2. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees: (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree, same as A.

So the IR data suggests a carbonyl (so that's one degree) and an -OH group. Wait, but the carbonyl is part of the same oxygen? Or different.

Wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is -OH. So the compound has an -OH group (as in an alcohol or phenol) and a carbonyl group.

So, the possible functional groups are an alcohol and a carbonyl. So maybe an ester with an alcohol group? Or maybe a ketone with an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps a carboxylic acid, but the peak at 1700 is more like an ester or ketone than a carboxylic acid, which is usually around 1700 as well but could be a bit higher. But the broad peak at 3000 might suggest a carboxylic acid, but then the 1650 might be the O-H bend. Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is very broad and usually around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But the question says the broad peak is at 3000, which seems a bit on the lower end. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol O-H.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad peak around 3000, but also a carbonyl around 1700, which matches. But then the 1650 peak could be something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol group. Wait, but esters can't have an -OH group as part of their structure unless it's a free alcohol elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. Suppose it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Then we would have an ester group (so carbonyl at 1700) and maybe an alcohol elsewhere, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol with a ketone or ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's a β-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups. Wait, but the IR only shows two strong peaks in the 1700 and 1650 regions, which could be two carbonyls. Hmm, but if it's a β-keto ester, the carbonyls are usually around 1700 and 1680 or so. But that's getting a bit detailed.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum, the fragment at m/z 45. What's the molecular formula for m/z 45? Let's see: 45 could be C3H7O+ (3*12=36, 7=7, 16=16; total 36+7+16=60 → no. Hmm, maybe a different approach. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), maybe the molecular ion is C6H10O2 (which would be 6*12=72, 10=10, 2*16=32 → 72+10=82 +32=114 → so M+ is 114. But the fragment is 45, which is half of that (about 45 * 2.53 = 113.25). Not sure about that.

Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3COO)+, but wait, (CH3COO-) is 60, but as a fragment, maybe it's losing some parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. For example, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has molecular weight 58. So a fragment could be (CH3)CO+ which is 58-15=43? Not 45.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+) which is 91. No, that's higher. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group attached to something else. Hmm.

Another angle: think about the molecular formula and possible fragments. Let's look at each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight is 6*12=72 + 12=84 + 32=116. So the molecular ion would be 116. A fragment of 45 could be a part of it. Let's see, 116 -45 =71. So perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts, one being 45 and the other 71.

But what could make a 45 fragment? Let's think about possible structural groups that would break off. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, perhaps the ester breaks into the acid and the alcohol part. For example, if it's an ester like RCOOR', the fragment could be the RCOO- part and R' part. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group's carbonyl is present. The fragment at 45 could be from a smaller part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule is a cyclic ester, I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10=82 +32=114. So the molecular ion is 114. 114 -45 =69. Not sure.

Alternatively, think about the presence of vinyl groups in NMR. The compound has a double bond, so at least one degree of unsaturation.

Wait, the options with two degrees of unsaturation (B and C) would have either a ring and a double bond or two double bonds, etc. But the IR and NMR data don't clearly point to that yet.

Let me think about the IR again. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is a carbonyl. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, but that's less common unless it's conjugated. Alternatively, it's a C=C stretch, possibly an aromatic ring. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are typically alkenes, not necessarily aromatic.

So if the compound has a double bond (from the vinyl H's), that's one degree of unsaturation. The carbonyl is another. So total degrees of unsaturation would be two. So the molecular formula should have two degrees of unsaturation.

Looking at the options, which formulas have two degrees of unsaturation?

Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

Assuming X and N are zero.

So:

A) C6H12O2: (14 -12)/2 = 1 → 1 degree.

B) C6H10O: (14 -10)/2=2 → 2 degrees.

C) C6H10O2: (14-10)/2=2 → 2 degrees.

D) C6H12O: (14-12)/2=1 → 1 degree.

So options B and C have two degrees each. So the compound likely has two degrees, which could come from a carbonyl (one) and a double bond (another), or a ring and a carbonyl, or two rings, etc.

So the formula is either B or C.

Now, considering the functional groups: we have an -OH (from the broad peak) and a carbonyl (from 1700). So the molecule has both an alcohol and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but in option B: C6H10O. That would have one O. So the carbonyl would be part of a ketone (which uses one O), and the -OH is another O. Wait, that would require two O's, but the formula only has one O. So that can't be right.

Wait, wait, option B is C6H10O. That's one O. So if the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, which is O) and an -OH (another O), that would require two O's, which B doesn't have. So option B is out.

So now the possible options are A, C, D. Wait no, we had eliminated options A and D earlier in terms of degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, let me reevaluate. If the formula is option C: C6H10O2. That has two O's. So one could be the carbonyl (like an ester, which has two O's: O from the carbonyl and O from the ester oxygen), and another O could be an -OH group. Alternatively, perhaps a ketone and an -OH, but that would require two O's.

Wait, but in an ester group, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. So that uses two O's: one in the ester oxygen and one in the carbonyl. Hmm, wait no, the carbonyl is a double bond O. So for one ester group, there are two O's: the OR' and the CO. So if the compound has an ester group, that accounts for two O's, which would fit option C (C6H10O2).

But wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH group. So if the compound is an ester, perhaps it's a methyl ester or ethyl ester, but that wouldn't have an -OH group. Unless the compound is a diol with an ester group. Or perhaps the ester is part of a cyclic structure, but that might not necessarily have an -OH.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think again. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is probably an -OH. So the compound has an alcohol group. So it must have an -OH, which implies that the formula has at least one O. But in option C, which is C6H10O2, that's two O's. So if one O is from the -OH group, the other O could be from an ester or another carbonyl group.

Wait, but an ester requires two O's: the carbonyl O and the ester oxygen. So if the compound is an ester, it would have two O's, but that doesn't leave any O's for an -OH, because the ester uses both O's. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, the compound could have a ketone (one O) and an -OH (another O). So that would use both O's in option C (C6H10O2). That would mean the structure has a ketone group and an -OH group. So the FTIR would show the ketone's carbonyl at around 1700 and the -OH group's broad peak around 3000. That makes sense.

So the formula would be C6H10O2. Now, what about the mass spectrum? The fragment at m/z 45.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, what's the molecular weight? 6*12=72, 10=10, 2*16=32 → 72+10=82+32=114. So M is 114. So the molecular ion would be at 114. But the fragment is at 45. How does that happen?

Well, perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts. For example, if it's a cyclic ester (like a lactone), the ring opening could produce a fragment. Alternatively, let's think about what the formula C6H10O2 could be. One possibility is a cyclic ester with a double bond, like a cyclic ester with a vinyl group. Or perhaps it's a substituted cyclopentanone with an alcohol group.

Wait, another possibility: the compound could be a β-keto ester. For example, something like CH3COCH2COOR. But that might not fit the formula.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment at 45 is from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2(COOR)CH2CH2CH2CH2OH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what's the molecular formula of the fragment at 45? It's m/z 45. So the molecular weight is 45. Let's see possible combinations.

The formula for 45 could be C3H7O2? No, that's 3*12 +7 +16*2=36+7+32=75 → too high.

Wait, perhaps it's C3H5O+? 3*12=36, 5=5, 16=16 → 57 → no.

Wait, maybe it's C2H5O2? 24 +5 +32=61 → no.

Hmm, perhaps it's CH3COO+ (which is 60). No, 45 is lower.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be a methyl group attached to something. Wait, maybe CH3COOH- would be 45? No, CH3COOH is 60. Wait, wait, maybe it's a different fragment.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2=CH-O- group. The molecular weight of CH2=CHO- would be 12*2 +4 +16 = 24 +4=28 +16=44. Close, but not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-O- plus a proton? That would make it 45? Let me calculate. The formula would be C2H5O. Molecular weight: 2*12=24 +5=5 +16=16 → 24+5=29 +16=45. Oh, that adds up! So the fragment could be C2H5O, which is 45.

So if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and a fragment is C2H5O, that would mean the molecule loses C4H5O (since 6-2=4 C, 10-5=5 H, 2-1=1 O). But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) and an ester group or something else. If the molecule breaks in such a way that the fragment includes a vinyl group and an oxygen, that would give a mass of 45.

Another thought: perhaps the molecule is cyclohexene with some substituents. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The correct formula must have two degrees of unsaturation (so options B and C). But option B can't have both a carbonyl and an -OH group because it only has one O. So option C is the only remaining possibility (C6H10O2).

So, putting it all together:

FTIR: broad peak at 3000 (OH), 1700 (carbonyl), 1650 (maybe conjugated double bond or another group).

NMR: vinyl hydrogens → double bond.

Mass spec: fragment at 45 → possibly a CH2=CH-O group, which is 45.

So the formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The possible formulas are **C6H12O2**, **C6H10O**, **C6H10O2**, and **C6H12O**. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an **-OH group** (likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
- A strong absorption peak at **1700 cm⁻¹** indicates a **carbonyl group** (e.g., ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid).
- A peak at **1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic C=C stretch.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicates the compound contains a **double bond**.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. Possible candidates include **C2H5O** (45), which could arise from a vinyl group with an oxygen atom.

### Degrees of Unsaturation:
- Degrees of unsaturation are calculated using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Degrees of Unsaturation} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H - X + N)}{2}
  \]
  Assuming no halogens (X) or nitrogen (N), the degrees of unsaturation for each option are:
  - **A) C6H12O2**: \( \frac{(14 - 12)}{2} = 1 \)
  - **B) C6H10O**: \( \frac{(14 - 10)}{2} = 2 \)
  - **C) C6H10O2**: \( \frac{(14 - 10)}{2} = 2 \)
  - **D) C6H12O**: \( \frac{(14 - 12)}{2} = 1 \)

  The IR and NMR data suggest the compound has **two degrees of unsaturation** (one from the carbonyl and one from the double bond), narrowing the options to **B** and **C**.

### Formula Analysis:
- **Option B (C6H10O)**: This formula has only one oxygen atom. However, the IR data indicates the presence of both a carbonyl group and an -OH group, which would require two oxygen atoms. Thus, **B is eliminated**.
- **Option C (C6H10O2)**: This formula has two oxygen atoms, which can account for both the carbonyl group and the -OH group. The degrees of unsaturation (2) also match the data.

### Mass Spectrometry Fragment:
- The fragment at **m/z = 45** is consistent with **C2H5O**, which could arise from a vinyl group with an oxygen atom. This is consistent with the structure implied by **C6H10O2**.

### Conclusion:
The compound has **two degrees of unsaturation**, includes both a carbonyl group and an -OH group, and produces a fragment at **m/z = 45**. The only formula that satisfies all the data is **C6H10O2**.

**Answer: C**
