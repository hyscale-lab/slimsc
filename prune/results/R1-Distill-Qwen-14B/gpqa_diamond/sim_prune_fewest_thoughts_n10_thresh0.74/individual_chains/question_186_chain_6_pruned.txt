Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a pericyclic reaction, specifically a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically occurs in 1,5-dienes, right? The reaction forms a new six-membered ring.

The molecule in question is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, let me try to visualize that structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane means there are two rings: a norbornane structure. So, the molecule has a bridge with two carbons and another bridge with two carbons as well, making a norbornene framework.

The substituents are a vinyl group and an azabicyclo system. Wait, 2-azabicyclo... so one of the bridgehead carbons is nitrogen. The numbering is 1S and 4R, so the stereochemistry is set.

When a 1,5-diene undergoes Cope rearrangement, it forms another 1,5-diene but with a different structure. The new molecule will have a six-membered ring. But how does that apply here?

Looking at the structure, the 2-vinyl group is attached to the bicyclo system. The vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, perhaps the azabicyclo compound has a conjugated diene system within it. Let me think about the possible diene.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene: the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6 perhaps, but the exact structure is a bit tricky. Wait, the parent is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, so the double bond is in a bridge. So, the molecule has a bridge with a double bond.

The molecule is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl is attached to the second carbon. Let me draw this out mentally. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridges: one connecting carbons 1 and 4 (maybe), and another connecting 1 and 2 (or something else). Wait, no, the bicyclo notation [x.y.z] is about the bridge lengths. So [2.2.1] means two carbons in one bridge, two in another, and one
