Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's break it down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I'll try to parse the structure. So, the molecule has a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a methyl group. That methyl is connected to a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexyl group. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, the structure has a cyclohexane with a substituent that includes another cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl part, plus an aldehyde group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So ethynyl is a triple bond, so it's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (like -C≡C-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to a carbon triple bond, so like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait no, ethynyl is -C≡C- so maybe cyclohexane with a CH2C≡CH group? Or is it cyclohexane attached directly to a carbon in the triple bond, like cyclohexane-C≡CH? I think ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

So how can we get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule?

Looking at the target, I see that there's a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. Also, the aldehyde group is present. So maybe we're doing some kind of oxidation or addition reactions.

Let me think about the reagents. The options give different sequences, so I need to figure out what each step does.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride. 2. H2/Pd. 3. Ba(OH)2. 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Hmm, NaNH
