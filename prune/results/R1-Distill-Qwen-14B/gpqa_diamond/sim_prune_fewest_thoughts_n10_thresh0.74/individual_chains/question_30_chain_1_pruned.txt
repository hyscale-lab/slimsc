Alright, so I've got this question about dyes and the light they emit. Hmm, okay, let's think. The question says that a textile dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember something about the energy levels and colors. Oh right, in organic compounds, especially those with conjugated double bonds, the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) determines the wavelength of light absorbed. When a molecule absorbs light, it's usually because the energy of the photon matches this gap.

So the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. But wait, wait. Wait, when a dye emits light, that's after it's been excited. Oh, right! Fluorescence happens when a molecule absorbs a photon and then emits another photon when it returns to the ground state. The energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed one because some energy is lost as heat or other processes.

So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted one. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon would have higher energy. Then, I can use the equation E = hc/Î» to find the wavelength, but wait, actually, the energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap, which is the energy needed to promote an electron from HOMO to LUMO.

Wait, but wait. Actually, in this context, the dye emits light when it drops from an excited state to a lower energy state. So the energy it emits is E_emit. The energy absorbed would be higher than that because the molecule was excited to a higher energy state, then relaxed back, emitting a lower energy photon.

So if the emission is 2.3393 eV, the absorption would be at a higher energy. So how do I find the absorption wavelength?

Wait, maybe I should think about the colors. The color that's absorbed is the complementary color of the emitted color. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because emission and absorption are related but different.

Wait, the dye emits light because it's excited, and that emitted light's color is determined by its energy. But the color it absorbs would be the one that corresponds to the energy gap. So perhaps I need to calculate the energy of the absorbed photon.

Wait, maybe I should recall that the energy levels are such that the absorbed photon's energy is equal to the energy gap (E_gap),
