Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read the question again. We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we have to find out the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to do this. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so it's probably a base. To dissolve it, we'd need an acid. The reaction should be a neutralization between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, right? Because when you have metal hydroxides, if they're from transition metals, they can be weak bases. So, in this case, the strong acid will react with Fe(OH)3 to produce Fe^3+ ions and water.

The first step is to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The formula is Fe(OH)3, so the molar mass is... let's see. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1*1) = 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of it. Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 mol. Alternatively, 0.1 /106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol.

Now, the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a monobasic strong acid. Let's assume the acid is HCl, a monobasic strong acid. The reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O.

Wait, the stoichiometry is important here. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl. So, moles of HCl needed would be 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3.

So, moles of HCl = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The HCl is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. Option B is 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69. So the volume is about 28, which is close to option C. But wait, did I do the calculation correctly?

Wait, Fe(OH)3 has a formula weight of 106.85, right? So 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol = approx 0.000936 moles. Yes.

Then, each mole requires 3 moles of HCl. So 0.000936 *3 = 0.002808 mol HCl.

Volume = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. So the volume is approximately 28.08 cm³, which matches option C's 28.05. But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So:

Fe: 55.845  
O: 3 * 16.00 = 48.00  
H: 3 * 1.008 = 3.024  
Total: 55.845 + 48 + 3.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

So 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.

Then, moles of HCl needed: 3 * 0.0009356 ≈ 0.0028068 mol.

Volume = 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³. So around 28.07 cm³. The options are C:28.05 and B:30.09. So option C is the closest. But wait, the question says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid" needed. So perhaps I'm missing something else?

Wait, another possibility. Because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, maybe it's not completely neutralized by the acid. But the problem states that we dissolve Fe(OH
