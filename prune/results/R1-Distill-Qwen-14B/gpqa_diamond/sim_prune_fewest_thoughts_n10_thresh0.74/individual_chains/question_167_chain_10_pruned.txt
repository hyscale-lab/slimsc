Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). Oh wait, right, because the inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha> might involve that exponential term.

The non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure, del_b. The formula is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix and rho is the state in question's density matrix.

So, the first thing I need to do is find rho and tau. Since rho is the density matrix of the given state, it's a pure state. So rho is |psi><psi|.

But wait, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian states. When you take a superposition of two coherent states, you get a non-Gaussian state. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero unless it's a Gaussian state.

But in this case, the state is a specific kind of superposition. Let me think about the parameters. Phi is given as -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5.

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, let's compute sin(2phi). 2phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1. That affects the normalization constant N.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)). Let me compute exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Then N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6274.

But wait, the normalization constant
