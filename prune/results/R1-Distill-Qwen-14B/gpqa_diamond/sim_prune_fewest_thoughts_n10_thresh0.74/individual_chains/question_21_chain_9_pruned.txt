Okay, so I have this chemistry question here. Let me try to break it down and think through it step by step. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But more importantly, it's asking about two separate concepts: tautomerism and optical isomerism. 

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which compound does not show tautomerism. Hmm, I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons, usually between different positions, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, which of these compounds can't undergo such a shift?

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups (O) in a benzene ring. Quinones are known for their keto-enol tautomerism. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the structure allows for the hydrogen to shift positions, leading to enol form. So benzoquinone does show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, at positions 1,3,5. I'm trying to visualize that. Oh wait, that would make all the ketones in a symmetrical arrangement. Now, for tautomerism, you need at least one alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group) because that's what moves during the tautomerism. So, does cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens? Each ketone is at a position, and the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. So each carbonyl is adjacent to CH2, which have hydrogens. So, each of those could potentially lose a hydrogen and shift.

Wait, but wait. If there are three ketones spaced every other carbon in a six-membered ring, then each C=O is separated by a CH2 group. So each CH2 is between two carbonyls? Or wait, the positions are 1,3,5. So the ring is numbered such that each of these ketones is on carbons 1,3,5, which are all adjacent? No, wait, the numbering is 1,3,5 in a six-membered ring would mean each is two carbons apart. Let me think: positions 1,3,5 on a benzene ring are adjacent, but on a cyclohexane, same applies. So each of the three ketones is opposite each other, but each is adjacent to other CH2 groups. So each CH2 is between two ketones. That would mean that each hydrogen on the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. But wait, when a hydrogen is alpha to two carbonyl groups, can it tautomerize?

Tautomerism typically involves the hydrogen moving to the adjacent carbonyl. But if the hydrogen is between two carbonyls, is that possible? Let's think: in a structure like (O=C-R-R-C=O), the H on the R can move to either side. But in the case of 1,3,5-trione,
