Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the resolution needed in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see what it's asking for. 

So, the setup is that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when observed in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. Oh right, time dilation formula: τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but the problem is about the resolution needed. I'm a bit fuzzy on how that ties in. Oh, right! The resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point from the production point, right? Because if the decay happens too far away, you can't tell where it occurred accurately.

So, the particles Y⁺ and Z⁻ are produced when X⁰ decays. The minimum resolution would be such that the decay length is just enough to allow detection. The decay length (L) is c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but wait, considering relativistic speeds, because the particle is moving, the lifetime is longer.

So, first, I need to find the velocity of X⁰. Since
