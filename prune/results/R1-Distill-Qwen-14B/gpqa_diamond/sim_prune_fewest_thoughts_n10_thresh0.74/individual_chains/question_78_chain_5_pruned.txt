Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. I remember that potentials are related to electric and magnetic fields, right?

The setup is that there's a charge q moving along some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. We need to find the potentials V and A at time t, where t is after tr.

I think I should recall the expressions for scalar and vector potentials in the context of moving charges. Wait, the scalar potential is usually due to the charge itself, and the vector potential comes from the current or motion of the charge.

For a static charge, the scalar potential V is (q)/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But when the charge is moving, things get a bit more complicated because of relativity and the speed of light delays.

Oh, right! The retarded time comes into play. The potentials depend on the position of the charge at an earlier time, tr, which is when the field was generated. The time it takes for the field to reach the observer is factored in.

So the general form for scalar potential V is something like (q)/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance between the charge at tr and the observation point r. But wait, I think the denominator might involve the distance d and the velocity v. Because when the charge is moving, there's a sort of contraction or a term that accounts for the motion's effect on the potential.

Wait, I think the scalar potential when the charge is moving would be adjusted by a term involving the velocity. The denominator would be (d c - d·v), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the signs here. Let me think: the denominator in the expression should be 4πε₀ multiplied by (d c minus the dot product of d and v), or plus? I'm not sure yet.

The vector potential A is usually proportional to the velocity of the charge. For a stationary charge, A is zero because there's no current
