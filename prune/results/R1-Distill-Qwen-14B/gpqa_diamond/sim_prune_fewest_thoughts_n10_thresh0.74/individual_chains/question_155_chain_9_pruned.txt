Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about uncertainties and operators. The uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the variance, which is ⟨ψ|O²|ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩², where O is the operator.

The system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). But wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So this state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That’s important because when the state is in an eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation value of that operator is just the eigenvalue.

Wait, but we're being asked about the uncertainty of P_z, which is the operator in its own eigenbasis. Since the state is a superposition of P_z eigenstates, the expectation value of P_z will be a combination of the eigenvalues, depending on the state's components.

Let me clarify the setup. The operators P_x, P_y, P_z have their matrix forms given. The basis vectors are those of P_z, so each basis vector corresponds to a particular eigenvalue of P_z.

The state vector is given, and I need to compute ΔP_z. So the procedure is: compute the expectation value of P_z squared, and subtract the square of the expectation value of P_z, then take the square root.

First, let's write down the state ψ. It's a column vector:
ψ = [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ].

Since this is in the P_z eigenbasis, each component corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. So the eigenvalues of P_z are probably ħ, 0, and -ħ, because looking at the matrix for P_z, the diagonal is [ħ, 0, -ħ]. So the basis vectors are |+z> (eigenvalue ħ), |0z> (eigenvalue 0), and |-z> (eigenvalue -ħ).

Wait, but in the P_z matrix, the diagonal is:
Row 1: ħ,
Row 2: 0,
Row 3: -ħ.

So the eigenstates are |1> = [1, 0, 0], |2> = [0,1,0], |3> = [0,0,1] with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ. So the given state ψ is a linear combination of these.

Our state is ψ = [ -1/2 |1> + (1/√2)|2> + (-1/2)|3> ].

Wait, but looking at the components, the first component is -1/2, the second is 1/sqrt(2), the third is -1/2.

So the state is a vector in this basis. Now, to compute the expectation value of P_z, which is just
