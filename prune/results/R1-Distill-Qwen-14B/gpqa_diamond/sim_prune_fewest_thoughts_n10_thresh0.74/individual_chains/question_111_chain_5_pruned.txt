Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about reaction mechanisms and product identification. Hmm, let me think through each part step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water to form product B. The options are A, B, C, D for the possible products.

Starting with the first reaction. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So, elimination reactions are likely here. Also, the starting material is a ketone, so perhaps some kind of enolate formation is involved.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with a strong base, especially a bulky one, it tends to form an enolate. The enolate can then attack an electrophilic position in ethyl acrylate, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That sounds like a Michael addition. So, the cyclohexanone will form an enolate, which will attack the acrylate.

But wait, where is the enolate formed? The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl is at position 1. So the possible enolate would form at positions 2 or 3. But the substituents are at 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). The base is bulky, so it will favor the more substituted, more stable enolate. Also, steric hindrance is a factor.

Looking at the structure, the ketone is at position 1. The positions adjacent (2 and 6) have substituents. If deprotonation occurs at position 3, that's meta to the ketone. Wait, no, the numbering might be a bit different. Let me draw the structure.

Cyclohexanone: position 1 is the carbonyl. Position 2 is ethyl, position 6 is methyl. So the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6, both substituted. If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, that's the alpha position across from substituents.

Wait, cyclohexanone is a six-member
