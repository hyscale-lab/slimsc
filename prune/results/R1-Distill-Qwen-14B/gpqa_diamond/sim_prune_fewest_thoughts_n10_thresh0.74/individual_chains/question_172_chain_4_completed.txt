Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. Oh right, it's something to do with the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. But wait, how does that translate into temperature?

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, 1.38 is a familiar number. Isn't that close to the Boltzmann constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K? So the energy difference ΔE is k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Or wait, no, that might be the average thermal energy. But here, the excitation depends on the exponential of the energy divided by kT.

Right, the Boltzmann factor is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if star_1 has twice as excited (so higher population in the upper level?), but wait the question says the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the upper to lower energy levels. So if star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's.

Let me think. If N1 and N2 are the number of excited atoms in star 1 and 2 respectively, then N1/N2 = 2. But wait, the question says that the excitation is twice. So N1_upper / N1_lower = 2 * (N2_upper / N2_lower). Or perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is double for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation level (like the ratio of the upper to lower states) is twice that in star_2. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2. Let me denote the ratio as x for star_2, so star_1 is 2x.

The ratio of the populations is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). Wait, no, wait. The energy difference is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower. So the formula is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Since ΔE is positive, the exponent is negative, so higher temperatures make the ratio larger because the exponential is less negative.

Wait, but in star_1, the ratio is higher than star_2. So star_1 has a higher temperature? Because higher T would mean exp(-ΔE/(kT)) is higher, since ΔE/(kT) is smaller, so the negative of that is a larger exponent.

So for star_1, (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ). Similarly for star_2, it's exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) ). And according to the problem, this ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the number of excited atoms (n_upper) is twice as much as in star_2? Or the ratio n_upper / n_lower is twice as large. Hmm, I think the latter makes more sense because excitation is about the relative populations. So (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2)/(n_lower2).

So that gives:

exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

Taking natural log on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Let me rearrange this. Move the ΔE/(k T2) to the left and the others to the right:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but wait the question is about finding an equation relating T1 and T2. The options don't involve ΔE, so perhaps the ΔE term cancels out or the ratio is such that it's in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k, since k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k*T_diff, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait in the equation I derived, ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )= ln(2). Let's plug in ΔE = k * something. Wait, wait. Let me see: ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So that gives ΔE = k * (1 K) *1.38e-23? Wait, no, actually 1.38e-23 J is equal to k. Because k is 1.380649e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T, where T is in Kelvin. Wait, but that's not directly applicable here. Because ΔE is a given value, and in the equation, ΔE is a fixed number for the energy level.

Wait, but I think I can proceed by substituting ΔE = k * something. Let me see.

ΔE/(k) = (k * something) / k = something. So in the equation:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Substitute ΔE = k * x, but I'm not sure about x. Alternatively, perhaps rearrangement can be done without knowing x.

Wait, let's write it again:

(ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

But that's still a problem because we don't know what ΔE is in terms of the temperatures. Unless ΔE is much smaller than k*T, which isn't necessarily the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming the same temperature for both, but that doesn't make sense because the excitation levels are different.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me start over.

The ratio of the populations for each star is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star 2: (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem states that for star_1, this ratio is twice as large as star_2. So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but this is the same result as before. So I can factor out 1/(k), but I don't know the value of ΔE. Wait, but from the question, we know that ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k, because 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K. So ΔE = k * 1 K.

Wait, that's an important observation. So ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting into the equation:

1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But the units on the left are 1/(K), so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I should just ignore the units for the equation since the problem gives us the values.

Wait, so:

1*(1/T2 -1/T1) = ln(2).

Which can be rewritten as:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Hmm, but looking at the options, they don't have any 1/T terms like that. Wait, let's see. Let me rearrange the equation:

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2).

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me go back to the problem statement.

The question says that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

But wait, k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Wait, so earlier equation:

(ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

But ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So:

1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which simplifies to:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) → but that can't be right because the left side has units of 1/K, and the right is unitless.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the units. Let me think again. Or perhaps the key is that the equation is (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = ln(2), and since ΔE/(k) = 1 K, the equation becomes:

(1 K) * (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = ln(2).

But the left side is (K)*(1/K) = dimensionless. So the equation is:

(1/T2 -1/T1) = ln(2)/ (1 K) * (1 K) ) → No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should treat T in Kelvin as unitless, so 1 K is just 1.

Wait, perhaps treating all Ts as unitless numbers in Kelvin, so K cancels out. So perhaps 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but looking at the options, none seem to match this. Let me consider the options:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, let me compute the left side. Let me write the equation I have:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T1 - T2 = ln(2) * T1 T2.

Which can be rewritten as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Which is exactly option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, wait, because the equation is:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is same as:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So yes, that's option D.

So the correct equation is D.


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). This implies \( \Delta E = k \cdot T_{\text{ref}} \), where \( T_{\text{ref}} = 1 \, \text{K} \).

The excitation of iron atoms follows the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star_1, the excitation level is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot T_{\text{ref}} \) and \( T_{\text{ref}} = 1 \, \text{K} \), we have \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Multiplying through by \( T_1 T_2 \) to clear the denominators:

\[
T_1 - T_2 = \ln(2) \cdot T_1 T_2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
