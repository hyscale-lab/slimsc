Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question says that the |3,0,0> state decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. Oh right, dipole transitions involve the emission or absorption of a photon, and the selection rules determine which transitions are allowed.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? I think for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum (l) changes by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number (m) can change by -1, 0, or +1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. The final state is |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0, m=0. But wait, the transition is via two steps. So it goes from 3 to something, then to 1.

Let me think: first transition from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state. What can that state be? Let's see. The initial l is 0, so the next possible l after a dipole transition (Δl=±1) would be l=1 (since 0+1=1). So the first step must be to a state with l=1. That would be a p orbital.

So the first transition must go from |3,0,0> to |n',1,m'>. What's n' in this case? Well, since the electron is going from n=3 to a lower n, but we don't know yet. Wait, the process is two transitions: 3→something→1. So the first step must take n=3 to a state which can then go to n=1.

Wait, the first transition could be 3→2 or 3→1. But wait, can you go from 3 to 1 in one step? Let me think about selection rules. The Δn for each dipole transition is not fixed, but for hydrogen, the Rydberg formula and the selection rules are more about l and m. So for a dipole transition
