Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and then break it down.

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. Now, the detector's radius is 30 meters. The question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead?

Hmm. So, the key here is probably figuring out how the Lorentz factor affects how far the particles travel before decaying. Because if the particles are moving faster (higher gamma), they might be able to travel further, right? So if gamma increases, more of them would reach the detector walls.

Wait, but wait. The initial setup says that with gamma ~20, one third reach the walls. So we need to find a higher gamma where two-thirds reach. That makes sense because higher speed means longer distance before decay, so more particles make it to the walls.

I remember that the distance a particle travels before decaying is related to its lifetime as observed in the lab frame. The proper lifetime (in the particle's rest frame) is multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma to get the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. So the lifetime t = gamma * t0, where t0 is the proper lifetime.

The distance the particle travels is velocity multiplied by time. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity is approximately the speed of light, c. So distance d = v * t ≈ c * gamma * t0.

But wait, the problem states that only a fraction of the particles reach the detector. That fraction probably depends on whether their decay happens before they reach the detector. So if a particle decays before traveling the radius of the detector, it won't reach the walls.

So the initial condition: for gamma = 20, about 1/3 reach the wall. The detector radius is 30 meters, so the distance each particle needs to travel to reach the wall is 30 meters.

I think the idea is that each particle has a certain probability to decay before traveling 30 meters. The fraction that reach the wall is the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to travel 30 meters at speed v.

Alternatively, maybe it's modeled using the concept of mean lifetime. Let me think: the mean proper lifetime is t0. The mean lab-frame lifetime is gamma * t0.

The time it takes for the particle to reach the detector walls is t = distance/speed. The distance is 30 m, speed is c (since ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c). So t = 30 / c.

The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is the exponential of the decay rate multiplied by t. The decay follows an exponential distribution: P(t) = e^(-t/(gamma t0)).

Wait, actually, the decay probability is P = e^(-t / (gamma t0)), because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime.
