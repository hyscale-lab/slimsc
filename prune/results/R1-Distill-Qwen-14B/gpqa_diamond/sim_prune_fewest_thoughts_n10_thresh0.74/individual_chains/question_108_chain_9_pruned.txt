Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing two energy terms in a hydrogen atom. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question is about paramagnetic coupling and transition energy in a hydrogen atom. 

Hmm, paramagnetic coupling... Oh right, that's related to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The term paramagnetic coupling would be the energy due to this interaction. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states of the hydrogen atom, like when an electron transitions between energy levels, emitting or absorbing a photon. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is the wavelength of the Balmer series for hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line. That corresponds to a transition from n=3 to n=2, or maybe n=2 to n=1? Wait, no, Balmer series is transitions to n=2, so H-alpha is n=3 to n=2. Or wait, I think H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, which is 656 nm. Oh wait, wait, the given wavelength here is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. Oh right, that's the Balmer line for H-beta, which is n=4 to n=2. Or is it? Let me think: the Balmer series has lines from higher levels down to n=2. The wavelengths are about 400 nm (H-delta?), 486 nm (H-beta), 656 nm (H-alpha), etc. So 486 nm is H-beta, transition from n=4 to n=2. So ΔE would be the energy difference for that transition.

Now, the problem is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with this transition energy ΔE. The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong field, but I'm not sure if it's enough for certain effects. Wait, paramagnetic effects are usually small, but I'm not certain.

Let me think about the paramagnetic term. The energy of the paramagnetic coupling is given by the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman energy is the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B S, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is
