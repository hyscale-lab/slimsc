Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The Mott-Gurney equation is used for the dark current in a semiconductor device, right? And it's applicable in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation given is J = (9/8) ε μ V² / L³. So, I remember that this equation comes from certain assumptions about the device.

Wait, what's the SCLC regime? Oh right, in that regime, the current is limited by the space charge itself. So the electric field is created by the charge that's accumulated in the device (the space charge) rather than an externally applied field. That happens when the injected carriers are enough to create a significant charge, like in tunneling or at high biases.

Now, the equation itself. I think it's derived for a single-carrier device. Because in two-carrier devices, like in bipolar transistors, there are electrons and holes, and the equations would be different, probably more complicated. So options D is a two-carrier device, so probably not correct.

The Mott-Gurney equation assumes that there's negligible series resistance, but more importantly, I remember it's valid when the contact between the semiconductor and the electrode is Ohmic. Ohmic contact means that the metal and semiconductor have a low injection barrier, so the carriers can move freely without much voltage loss. So, if the contact were non-Ohmic, like a Schottky barrier, that would complicate things, right? So looking at the options, option C mentions a Schottky contact which might make the equation invalid. But wait, the equation might still apply if other conditions are met, but I think the presence of a barrier would change the current behavior.

Wait, another point is about traps. The equation is for a trap-free device. Traps are impurities or defects that can capture and release carriers, which can lead to different current-voltage characteristics. So any option that says 'trap-free' is more likely correct.

Now, about the current components. The equation is derived under the assumption that drift current is dominant and that diffusion is negligible. Wait no, wait. In the SCLC region, the current is limited by the space charge, which forms a region where the electric field is determined by the built-up charge. So for this, I think the derivation assumes that the current is due to the electric field created by the space charge, which involves both drift and possibly some field-assisted emission from traps. Oh wait, but the Mott-Gurney equation comes from the case where the emission is from the cathode, and the device is in the regime where the space charge is dominant, so the electric field is not Ohmic but determined by the space charge.

Wait, talking about drift vs diffusion. Oh, I think that when the voltage is such that the space charge is dominant, the current is mainly due to the movement of the charge under the electric field created by the space charge. So, maybe diffusion is considered negligible because the drift dominates. Or, wait, in some cases, like when the electric field is strong, drift is more significant. So the Mott-Gurney equation is applicable when the current is limited by the space charge, which is in the SCLC regime, so the main condition is that the space charge is dominant, and perhaps the assumption is that the contact is Ohmic.

Wait, another important point: I think the Mott-Gurney equation is derived for a single-carrier device, so options B and C are single-carrier, but D is two. So probably the correct answer is A, B, or C. Let me think again.

Option A says "trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current." Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the equation is for the SCLC regime, which implies that drift is the main mechanism. If drift were negligible, maybe it's a different regime.

Option B: "trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current." Hmm. No carrier injection barrier sounds like an Ohmic contact, which is correct because an Ohmic contact has a low barrier, so no significant barrier to injection. Also, if there's no trap, that fits. And negligible diffusion current—so assuming drift dominates. Because in Mott-Gurney, the current is due to drift in the space-charge region.

Wait, what's the difference between drift and diffusion currents. Drift current is due to the electric field causing carriers to move. Diffusion is due to concentration gradients. So in SCLC, the electric field is strong enough that drift dominates. So, if the condition is negligible diffusion current, that would align with the assumption.

Wait, but the equation itself includes the mobility, which is the drift mobility. So the equation is about drift current. So in the equation's derivation, the diffusion current is neglected, implying that it's negligible.

So looking back at the options: which ones have 'no traps', 'single-carrier', and either 'Ohmic' or 'no injection barrier'.

Option B says 'no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. That seems correct.

Option A: has 'negligible drift current' which can't be right because the equation is about drift.

Wait, option B: "no carrier injection barrier" implies an Ohmic contact as well. So that's correct.

Option C: has a Schottky contact, which introduces a barrier, so probably not the condition under which Mott-Gurney holds.

So, putting it all together:

The correct conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation are a single-carrier device, trap-free, with Ohmic (no injection barrier) contacts, and negligible diffusion current. So the statement in option B is correct.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation, \( J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3} \), is derived under specific assumptions about the device. These assumptions include a single-carrier mechanism, negligible traps (a trap-free device), and negligible diffusion current, with drift current being dominant. Additionally, the equation assumes an Ohmic contact, meaning there is no significant carrier injection barrier, as this ensures the electric field is primarily determined by the space charge.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: Mentions "negligible drift current," which contradicts the SCLC regime where drift current is dominant. This makes Option A incorrect.
- **Option B**: States that the equation is valid for a "trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current." This aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation, as it includes an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier), negligible diffusion current, and a single-carrier, trap-free device. This is correct.
- **Option C**: Mentions a "Schottky contact," which introduces a barrier and complicates the current behavior. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes an Ohmic contact, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Refers to a "two-carrier device," which is inconsistent with the Mott-Gurney equation, as it applies to single-carrier devices. This makes Option D incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is provided by **Option B**, as it satisfies all the necessary conditions for the equation to hold.

Answer: B
