Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and is 1 Tesla. Oh, and the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so probably m is 0, 1, or maybe a little bit higher. But since it's small, maybe the effects are manageable.

The question is about comparing the expectation value of H (the Hamiltonian) due to the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atom transition given has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. I think that's the Balmer series, specifically the transition from n=2 to n=1, which is the H-alpha line. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is about 486 nm. So the energy ΔE can be found using the Rydberg formula.

Wait, or more precisely, since the energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = - (Ry)/n², where Ry is the Rydberg constant, around 13.6 eV. So the transition energy between two levels would be the difference between their energies. Let's say the transition is from n=2 to n=1. Then ΔE would be E_1 - E_2 = (-13.6 eV) - (-3.4 eV) = -10.2 eV, but since energy differences are positive, ΔE is 10.2 eV. Hmm, wait, but wait, the exact value might not matter as much as the order of magnitude.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, but wait, orbital magnetic quantum number is m, so maybe the term in question is the Zeeman term, which involves the orbital and spin contributions. Hmm, but the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term," which I think refers to the spin-orbit coupling, but wait, no, wait. Paramagnetism is due to the spin magnetic moment interacting with the external field, right? So perhaps the term is the Zeeman term for the spin.

Wait, but the magnetic field is applied, so the Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic coupling would be H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment here is the spin magnetic moment, μ = g_s μ_B m_s, but wait, m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number, which can be ±1/2. Alternatively, for the orbital part, it's m times μ_B. But the question is about the paramagnetic coupling, which refers to the spin part. So for each electron, the paramagnetic term would be H = -g_s μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The paramagnetic effect comes from the spin of the electron, not the orbital angular momentum, right? So the coupling term is the spin term.

So for a single electron in a hydrogen atom, the paramagnetic coupling energy is given by H = -μ_B m_s B. Because m_s can be ±1/2, so the energy would be ± (μ_B B)/2.

Wait, what's μ_B? The Bohr magneton is approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T. So for B=1 T, the energy would be (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 T * (1/2), because m_s is 1/2. So (approx) 4.637e-24 J.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) is small. Oh, but m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number, which is ±1/2 for electrons. So perhaps the paramagnetic term is proportional to m_s, which is 1/2, but the orbital term would be m times something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. The problem is about the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the spin term. So the paramagnetic term is H = -μ·B, where μ is the spin magnetic moment.

So the energy of that term is (μ_B * B * m_s) for each electron. But wait, since each electron has spin 1/2, m_s can be ±1/2. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ for each spin state would be ± (μ_B * B * 1/2). But since we're talking about the magnitude, perhaps we can take the absolute value, so μ_B * B * 1/2.

Wait, but in the hydrogen atom, the ground state has only one electron, right?
