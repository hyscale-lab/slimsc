Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through what I remember from my studies.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Hmm, I think I should start by understanding what's happening here. So, first, when you dilute a weak acid with water, you're making it less concentrated, which usually decreases the degree of ionization. But the pH might not decrease much because the solution is weaker but more diluted—wait, actually, no. Wait, when you dilute an acid, the pH increases a little, but since it's a weak acid, it might not change as drastically as a strong acid like HCl.

Wait, wait, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. When we add water, we're increasing the volume, so the concentration of H+ ions will decrease, which would make the pH higher. So the initial pH after dilution would be higher than the original concentration. But wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M. Let me calculate that first, just to have a reference.

So, the initial solution before dilution is 0.05 M acetic acid. The Ka is 1.85e-5. The formula for weak acids is Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA]. For a weak acid, the [H+] is approx sqrt(Ka * C), assuming C is much larger than Ka. So for 0.05 M, sqrt(0.05 * 1.85e-5).

Let me compute that. 0.05 is 5e-2. 5e-2 * 1.85e-5 is 9.25e-7. The square root of that is around 3.04e-4, so pH is about 3.5 something. Wait, because pH is -log(3.04e-4). Log(3) is 0.48, so 3.04e-4 is 10^(-3.52) so pH is about 3.52. But wait, that's before dilution.

Now, when we dilute it by adding 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of the acid, the new volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration of acetic acid becomes (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the concentration is halved. Now, I need to find the pH of this 0.025 M acetic acid solution.

Again, using the same weak acid formula. Ka is 1.85e-5. So for 0.025 M, the [H+] would be sqrt(0.025 * 1.85e-5). Let's compute that. 0.025 is 2.5e-2. Multiply by 1.85e-5, we get 4.625e-7. Square root is about 2.15e-4. pH is -log(2.15e-4). Let me calculate log(2.15e-4). Log(2.15)=0.332, so 0.332 -4 is -3.668 → pH is approximately 3.668? Wait, no, because pH is -log, so 2.15e-4 is 10^-3.668, so pH is 3.668. So about 3.67. But wait, wait. Wait, that's just the pH after dilution, but the problem is about titration. So after dilution, we titrate this solution with NaOH.

Wait, the problem is to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So I need to figure out those two points.

First, let's think about the equivalence point. The equivalence point occurs when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So, the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is such that the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (40 cm³ is 0.04 L) → 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001. Volume is moles / concentration → 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³. Then, when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 50 cm³. At equivalence, all the acetic acid (0.001 moles) is neutralized to produce 0.001 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So, the solution at equivalence is 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.05 L (50 cm³). Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the solution will be basic because acetate undergoes hydrolysis in water.

The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

To find the pH, we can calculate the concentration of OH^- using the Kb of acetate. Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Again, for a weak base, [OH-] can be approximated as sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6. Then pH is 14 - (-log(3.29e-6)). Let's compute that.

Log(3.29e-6) is log(3.29) + log(1e-6) → 0.517 -6 = -5.483. So pH is 14 - 5.483 = 8.517. So approximately 8.52. Wait, but wait: when we're dealing with a weak base, sometimes the assumption that [OH-] is sqrt(Kb*C) is not valid if C is too low or Kb too small. Let me check the approximation. Kb*C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08e-11, which is much less than 1e-3, so the approximation should be okay. So pH is about 8.52.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Alternatively, another approach is to use the exact formula. The hydrolysis equation is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb expression is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is the [OH^-], which is approx 3.29e-6 as above, so x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ Kb. Since x is about 3e-6, 0.02 is 2e-2, so x is negligible compared to 0.02. So the approximation holds. So pH is 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, option D is 4.57;6.92, etc. So the equivalence pH is around 8.52, which matches option A's second value. But wait, let's think again. Wait, the problem states that the dilution is done before titration. So when we start titration, the solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid, and then we add NaOH.

Now, what about the 25% titration point. 25% of the equivalence volume. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001. Each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid.

So, when 25% of the equivalence point is reached, that's 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. So moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol.

So, in the solution, the moles of acetic acid will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 mol.

So the solution now contains both acetic acid and its conjugate base. That sounds like a buffer solution. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log ( [base]/[acid] ). So pKa is given by -log(Ka) → pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.736.

So [base] is 0.00025, [acid] is 0.00075. The ratio is 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259. So around 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. That would fit. So the answer is A.

But wait, what about the total volume at the 25% point? Because when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to the initial 40 cm³, the total volume is 42.5 cm³. So the concentrations would be:

[HA] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Which again gives log(1/3) ≈ -0.477, same as before. So pH is 4.736 -0.477=4.259, which is about 4.26.

So the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and at equivalence it's about 8.52. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So that's the first and second values. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me cross-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point. Because when all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it's basic. The concentration is 0.001 moles in 0.05 L (50 cm³), which is 0.02 M acetate. So Kb is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. So Kb = 5.405e-10. The [OH] would be sqrt(Kb * C), which is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6. Then pH is 14 - log(3.29e-6). Let me compute log(3.29e-6).

Log(3.29) is about 0.517, so log(3.29e-6) is 0.517 -6 = -5.483. So pH is 14 -5.483=8.517, which is approximately 8.52. So that seems correct.

So the pH at equivalence is 8.52, and at 25% it's 4.26. So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we analyze the two key points: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at the equivalence point.

### 1. **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻) in a total volume of 50 cm³ (40 cm³ of the diluted acetic acid + 10 cm³ of NaOH). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH₃COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid and undergoes hydrolysis in water:

\[
\text{CH₃COO}^- + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases, the concentration of OH⁻ ions is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] \approx \sqrt{K_b \cdot C} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.02)} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - (-\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6})) \approx 14 - 5.483 = 8.52.
\]

### 2. **25% Titration Point**
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added to the diluted acetic acid solution. At this point, the solution contains both acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer. The moles of CH₃COOH and CH₃COO⁻ are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad
[\text{CH₃COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH₃COO}^-]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.736 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.736 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) = 4.736 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately **4.26**, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
