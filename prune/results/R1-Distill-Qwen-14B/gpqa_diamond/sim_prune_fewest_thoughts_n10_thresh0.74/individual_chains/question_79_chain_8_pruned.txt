Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying Compound X based on its reaction and the NMR data of the product. 

The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The NMR data of the product is given, and I need to figure out which option is correct.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Hofmann elimination reaction. Hofmann elimination is typically used to remove an amine from an amide, forming an alkene. But wait, Compound X is reacting with this reagent, which is a strong base, so maybe it's an epoxide ring opening? Or maybe another elimination reaction.

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a Lewis acid catalyst sometimes used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh, epoxide ring opening. So if Compound X is an epoxide, reacting with this base would cause it to open, perhaps. Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, the product's NMR data is given. Let's look at that. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), and some aromatic signals. The aromatic region has a doublet at 6.75 (1H), then a doublet at 7.08 (2H), then another doublet at 7.68 (1H), and a doublet at 7.71 (2H). Hmm, that seems like a substituted benzene ring with some substituents causing the splitting.

The 13C NMR has a bunch of signals. Let's look: two singlets at 21.3 and 28.4, which are probably methyl groups. Then a bunch of carbons in the aromatic region. Also, a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl carbonâ€”maybe a ketone or an ester? Or wait, in the product, maybe it's an epoxide that's opened, so perhaps a carbonyl isn't present. Or wait, perhaps the starting material had a carbonyl, and the reaction didn't affect that.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. Let me calculate its degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C11H12O: X=0, N=0. So (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees: that could be two rings (each a degree) and four double bonds, or a combination. Wait, 6 degrees: could
