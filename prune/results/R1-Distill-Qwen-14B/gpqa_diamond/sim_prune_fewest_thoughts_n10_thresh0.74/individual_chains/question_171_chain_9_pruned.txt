Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through.

The question is about the substitution of bromine in different aromatic compounds, and we need to arrange them by the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced. The options are 1 through 6, each a benzene derivative.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing effects of substituents are crucial. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) are meta directors, while electron-donating groups (EDGs) are ortho/para directors. But wait, some substituents are more activating or deactivating than others. The more deactivating a group is, the less activating the ring is towards electrophilic attack.

So each compound here has a substituent attached to benzene. Let's list them:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an EDG, activating the ring. So it's an ortho/para director.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's phenyl acetate. The COOEt group is an EWG because ester groups are deactivating. Esters are meta directors.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. Cl is an EWG (due to its electronegativity), but it's a weaker EWG compared to, say, nitro groups. Wait, no, wait. Chlorine is ortho/para directing but deactivating. Because Cl has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, but it's also electron-withdrawing through inductive effect. So overall, it's a deactivating but ortho/para director.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. Nitro is a strong EWG. Definitely meta directing. And the ring is highly deactivating, making substitution occur less readily.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an EDG (activating), so ortho/para director.

6) C6H5-COOH: Phenoic acid derivative. Carboxylic acid group is a strong EWG. So meta director. Wait, COOH is a
