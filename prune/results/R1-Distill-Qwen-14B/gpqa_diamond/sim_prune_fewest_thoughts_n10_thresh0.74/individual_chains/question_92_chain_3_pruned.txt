Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a branched alkene, maybe some sort of diene structure. Enthalpy of formation, right, that's the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

Wait, the question gives some bond energies. Oh right, enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies if we know the number of each bond in the molecule. The formula is ΔHf° = sum of bond energies of reactants – sum of bond energies of products. But wait, actually, for formation, it's the other way around. Or is it the reverse? Hmm, I think the correct approach is to consider the bonds broken and formed.

Wait, no, the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to form the molecule from its constituent elements. So in terms of bond energies, I think the formula is: the enthalpy of formation is equal to the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the product minus the sum of the bond energies in the reactants. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by taking the total bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule, considering how many of each type of bond are present,
