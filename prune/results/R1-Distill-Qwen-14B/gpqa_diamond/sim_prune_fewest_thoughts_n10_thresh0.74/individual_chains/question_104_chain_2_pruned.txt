Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity, right. I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass, similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the setup is similar for both stars.

The question is about the orbital periods. They detected a spectral line shift for each star. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, how does the shift relate to the planet's orbital period?

I think the key here is the Doppler shift and the formula related to the radial velocity method. The RV method measures the velocity of the star towards or away from us, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula I recall is that the semi-amplitude K of the Doppler shift is given by some equation involving the masses and the orbital period.

Let me think. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = ( (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (P) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part goes away. And since the planet mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that both stars have the same mass as the Sun. So M_star is same for both. And the planets have similar masses to Neptune, so M_p is same for both as well. Wait, no, the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is same for both. So M_p is same for both, M_star same for both. So then, the only varying factor between K and the orbital period is the period itself.

So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) divided by P^(1/3), perhaps? Or wait, let me think again about the formula.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) /
