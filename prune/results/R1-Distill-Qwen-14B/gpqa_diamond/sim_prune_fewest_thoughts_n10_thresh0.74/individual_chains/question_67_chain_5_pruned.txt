Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

Alright, the question says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. I'm told to ignore their spin angular momentum, which probably simplifies things a bit because I don't have to worry about spin states. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1 (since p orbitals have l=1). The total angular momentum quantum number is l=2, and m is -1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z (the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum) and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each. So, for each electron, L_z would be -ħ. If I remember right, the eigenvalues of L_z are given by mħ, so here m for each would be -1, leading to -ħ for each.

Wait, but in the coupled state, the total m is -1, which is the sum of the individual m's. So if each m_i is -1, then the total m would be (-1) + (-1) = -2. But the given state has m=-1. That's a problem. So how can each electron have m_i = -1 in this state?

Hmm, maybe that's the crux here. Because the total m is -1, which is the sum of the individual m's. So if the measurement of each L_z gives -ħ, that would mean each m_i is -1, summing to m_total = -2. But the state is |..., m=-1>, so that's not possible. Therefore, the probability should be zero.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The state is |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>. The possible m values for each electron can vary, but their sum must be -1. So for each electron, possible m1 and m2 could be such that m1 + m2 = -1.

So, when we measure L1z and L2z, each can have m1 and m2 values that sum to -1. The possible pairs (m1, m2) are (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1), (1, -2). Wait, but wait, each electron has l=1, so their m can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible combinations where m1 + m2 = -1 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0.

m1=0, m2=-1.

m1=1, m2=-2. But wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So that's not allowed. Similarly, m1 can't be 2 or anything beyond that. So the only possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the only possible outcomes are when one electron has m=-1 and the other
