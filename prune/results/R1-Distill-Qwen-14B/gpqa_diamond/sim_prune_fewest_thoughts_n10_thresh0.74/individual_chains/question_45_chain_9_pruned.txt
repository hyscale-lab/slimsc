Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. We need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²).

The options are A, B, C, D with different combinations. I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. The formula for the energy levels is En = (n²)E, where E is the base energy unit given here.

Wait, but the particles are spin-1/2, which are fermions. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold only one fermion. So in the well, each energy level can have only one particle in each spin state, but wait, spin-1/2 particles have spin up and spin down. So each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, no, that's for electrons, which are fermions. But the question says spin-1/2 particles, so I'll assume they're fermions. So each spatial orbital can have two particles with opposite spins.

So the well has four particles. Let me think about how they fill up the energy levels.

In a 1D infinite well, the allowed energy levels are En = (n²) * (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²) = n² E. So E is the ground state energy for the first level (n=1).

Now, for four identical fermions, each with spin-1/2, each spatial state (n) can have two particles (spin up and spin down). So the first step is to fill the lowest energy levels, each with as many particles as possible, considering the Pauli exclusion.

So the ground state would be when the particles are in the lowest possible energy levels with the lowest possible n, each filled with two particles.

Let me think about how the four particles would fill the levels.

The energy levels are filled starting from the lowest n. Each n can hold two particles (since spin up and down).

So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles (spins up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spins up and down)
Wait, that's four particles. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, n=1 has a single orbital, which can hold two particles (with opposite spins). Similarly, n=2 can also hold two particles. So yeah, that's four particles.

So the total energy of the system in the ground state is the sum of the energies of each particle's state. Each particle in n=1 has energy 1² E = E, and each in n=2 has energy 4E.

So two particles at n=1 contribute 2E, two at n=2 contribute 8E. Total for ground state: 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, wait, that's 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E
