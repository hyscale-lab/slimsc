Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through carefully. The question is about identifying an unknown compound among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The given data is the 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I remember that NMR can tell us a lot about the structure, especially the splitting patterns and the number of protons. Let me jot down the data:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (?)
Wait, the description says 'dq' which I think stands for doublet of quartets? Or maybe doublet of doublets? Hmm, I'm not sure, but I'll keep that in mind.
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet. This is probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an oxygen, like an ester.
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet. That might be a methyl group next to a CH2 or maybe attached to a CH group adjacent to something else.

So, the molecule is an acetate ester, since there's a CH3COO- group. The part after 'propenyl' or 'butenyl' would be the substituent.

Let me think about each option's structure. Acetates are esters of acetic acid, so the general structure is CH3CO-O-R, where R is the substituent.

Looking at the options:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate: So the R group is a butenyl, which has a double bond. Cis would mean the substituents on either end of the double bond are on the same side.
Structure of the substituent: CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. So, CH2=CHCH2CH2- or maybe CH2CH2CH=CH? Wait, but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2O... ?

Wait, no, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or maybe CH2CH2CH=CH, but I think butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as the substituent. Or perhaps the double bond is in a different position.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. Butenyl can be 1-, 2-, 3-butene substituents. Wait, but the options are butenyl acetate, which would have the OAc group on the end. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, no, more accurately, for propenyl acetate, the substituent is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, propenyl is three carbons with a double bond, so CH2=CHCH2-OAc for propenyl acetate.

Similarly, butenyl is four carbons, so CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (if the double bond is between C1 and C2
