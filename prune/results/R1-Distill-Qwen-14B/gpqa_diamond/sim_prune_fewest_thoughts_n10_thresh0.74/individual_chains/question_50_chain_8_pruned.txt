Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops this Feynman diagram has based on the given expression. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the divergence of the integral and the degree of divergence, which in turn depends on the superficial degree of divergence formula. But wait, the question is about loop counting based on the estimated size given by the expression.

Wait, the expression is alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let's break this down.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e²/(4πε₀ ħ c) or similar. But I'm more concerned about the factors that relate to loop integrals. Each loop contributes a certain factor to the integral's dimensionality.

In general, when you have a loop integral, the integral in d dimensions (for regularization) has a certain scaling with the energy scale. The superficial degree of divergence is given by D = dL - 2I + V, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, for a Feynman diagram with L loops, the integral typically has a certain power of the energy scale.

Wait, but in the expression, the term (Q/M)^2 stands out. If M is a mass scale (like the mass of a particle in the loop), and Q is some energy scale, then (Q/M)^2 is a dimensionless quantity. So that would indicate that the integral's dependence is (Q/M)^something
