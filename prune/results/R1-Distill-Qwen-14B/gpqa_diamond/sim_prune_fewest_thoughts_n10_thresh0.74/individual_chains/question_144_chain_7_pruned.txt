Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through this step by step. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. 

Alright, the given data: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's going to be a very tiny distance.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (tau) multiplied by the velocity (v). Oh right, because distance is speed multiplied by time. So L = c * tau * v. But wait, gamma might come into play because particles moving at relativistic speeds have time dilation.

Wait, but first, how do I find the lifetime tau? I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau. So, tau = ħ / Γ. 

Wait, but units can be tricky here. Let me think about the units. ħ is in units of GeV·s, I think. Or wait, no, ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So, if Γ is given in GeV, then tau would be in seconds.

Wait, Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ. Let me plug in the numbers. ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So,

tau = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Let me calculate 6
