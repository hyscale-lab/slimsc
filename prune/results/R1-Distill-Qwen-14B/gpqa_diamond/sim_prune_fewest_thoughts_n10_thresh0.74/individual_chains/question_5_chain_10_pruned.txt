Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with angular momentum operators, the eigenvalue equations are crucial. The operator here is P, which I think corresponds to the spin angular momentum operator, since we're dealing with a muon (which is a lepton, like an electron, and has spin-1/2). So, P must be the spin operator.

Each component of P (Px, Py, Pz) is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down each of these matrices.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. 

Wait, but the operator we're interested in isn't Px, Py, or Pz individually. Instead, it's the operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane. So, the operator P along n would be the sum of the components scaled by the direction vector. 

The general form for an angular momentum operator along a direction n is P = nx Px + nz Pz. Because Py is along the y-axis, and since n is in x-z plane, ny is zero. So, the operator P is a combination of Px and Pz. 

So, let me write P as:

P = nx * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + nz * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Let me compute this matrix. Let me factor out (ħ/2) first.

P = (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Wait, let me check that multiplication. The first term from Px is [[0, nx], [nx, 0]], since it's multiplied by nx. The second term from Pz is [[nz, 0], [0, -nz]]. Adding these together gives [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]. Yes, that looks right.

So, P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]. 

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b], which is normalized (so |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1).

The eigenvalue equation is P * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b].

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, but P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So, plugging in, we have:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the matrix equation becomes:

nz * a + nx * b = a
nx * a - nz * b = b

Which gives two equations:

1) nz a + nx b = a
2) nx a - nz b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

nz a + nx b - a = 0 → a (nz - 1) + nx b = 0 → a (nz - 1) = -nx b → equation (1a)

Equation 2:

nx a - nz b - b = 0 → nx a - (nz + 1) b = 0 → equation (2a)

So, from equation (1a): a = (-nx b) / (nz - 1)

Substituting into equation (2a):

nx * [ (-nx b)/(nz-1) ) ] - (nz + 1) b = 0

Let me compute this:

(-nx² b)/(nz -1) - (nz +1) b = 0

Factor out b:

b [ (-nx²)/(nz -1) - (nz +1) ] = 0

Assuming b is not zero (since if b were zero, from equation (1a), a would also have to be zero, which isn't a valid eigenvector), then:

[ (-nx²)/(nz -1) -
