Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula they're implying is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each being a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds, and the formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / plx. So if plx is small, the distance is large, right? Because as you get farther away, the parallax decreases.

So, if I have N proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and since plx is 1/distance, then plx = 1/r, where r is the distance in parsecs. Let me substitute that in. So, plx = 1/r → 1/plx = r.

So replacing plx in the original equation, N ∝ (1/( (1/r) ))^5 → (r)^5. Wait, but wait, no. Let me clarify. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, then 1/(plx) is r. So, 1/(plx)^5 becomes r^5. Therefore, N ∝ r^5. Hmm, but wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, N increases as the fifth power of r.

But wait, the question is about the change per unit distance. Wait, no. The question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So I think that's asking for the variation of N with r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. When you have parallax, plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/r. So, 1/plx is r.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k*(
