Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product based on the given IR and NMR data, and then choose the correct option from A to D.

First, I should analyze the spectroscopic data to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can predict what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let's start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretches (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe N-H. But the presence of a peak around 1720 cm-1 is a strong clue. That's characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Also, there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which might be a C=C aromatic stretch, and 1450 cm-1 could be from C-O stretching or maybe another aromatic ring vibration.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet which is often an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but those usually show up around 9-10 ppm and might not be a broad singlet. Wait, but a carboxylic acid proton is broad because it's exchanging and appears around 10 ppm. So maybe Compound X has a carboxylic acid group.
  
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is typical of aromatic protons. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, which might be part of a para-substituted benzene ring. Two protons in a doublet could mean they are ortho to each other but in a para di-substituted benzene. Wait, actually, in a para-substituted benzene, each aromatic proton has two neighboring protons. But wait, let me think. No, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other. So if the substituents are in the para positions, each aromatic proton is two doublets. Hmm, maybe the substituents are two groups on the ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a mono-substituted benzene, but that would have a different splitting.

Wait, the NMR shows two sets of aromatic protons: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That makes me think of a para-substituted benzene where each substituent has two protons. Or wait, perhaps it's a 1,2-disubstituted benzene? No, because each doublet has 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution? No, meta would have more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where each substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, causing the adjacent protons to be deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause each
