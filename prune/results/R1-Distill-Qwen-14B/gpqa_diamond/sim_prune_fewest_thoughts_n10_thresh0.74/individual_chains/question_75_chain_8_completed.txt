Alright, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, specifically dealing with transgenic mice and gene expression. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Okay, the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, but the overexpression isn't happening as expected. They're looking for why the construct isn't working.

The problem lies in the DNA sequence provided. Let me look at that. The plus strand starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... and so on. Wait, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA. ATG is the start codon methionine. TAC is Tyr, CCA is Pro. So the reading frame starts with Met-Tyr-Pro.

But wait, the HA tag is a specific peptide sequence. The HA tag is usually around 11 amino acids from the influenza hemagglutinin. The coding sequence for HA is something like YPYDVPDYA. Let me think about the DNA sequence for that. But wait, in the problem, the plus strand's initial sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... Hmm. So the coding sequence starts with ATG and then TAC is Tyr, which is correct for the HA tag.

Wait, but wait another thing. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus. So in the construct, the HA should be at the beginning of the coding sequence. Let me think about the reading frame. The plasmid is supposed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G. So the construct should start with the HA coding sequence, then the GADD45G coding sequence.

But looking at the provided sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is Met. Then TAC is Tyr, which would be the second amino acid in HA. Wait, but HA starts with YPYDVPDYA. So the first amino acid is Tyr, then Pro, then Tyr, etc. So the sequence for HA, in nucleotides, should start with TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr), then GAT (Asp), etc. But wait, in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), followed by TAC, then CCA. Wait, that's correct for the HA tag. Because the HA tag's first amino acid is Tyr, so the first codon after ATG would be TAC, making it Met followed by Tyr. But wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, which is the start of the protein. So the GADD45G's coding sequence would start after the HA tag.

But wait, looking at the sequence, the initial part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC GCC AAA TGA. Wait, the HA tag should be followed by the GADD45G sequence. So the problem is that perhaps the reading frame is messed up, or there's a stop codon early on.

Wait, looking at the sequence, after the initial ATG, the next codons are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTA (Val), TCC (Ser), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA. Oh wait, TGA is a stop codon. So the third codon after the start is TAC, then CCA, TAC, GAT, GTA, TCC, GCC, AAA, and then TGA.

So the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC GCC AAA TGA ... So the first few codons are Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, Ser, Ala, Lys, and then TGA, which is a stop codon. So the translation would terminate after 9 amino acids, which is way before the HA tag is complete, let alone the GADD45G.

That's a problem because the HA tag is longer than a few residues. So the HA sequence would only make it part way through before the ribosome hits the stop codon. That would prevent the HA tag from being properly expressed, and thus the entire GADD45G wouldn't be expressed either.

So why is there a stop codon so early in the sequence? Oh, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence was incorrectly cloned. Let me think: the HA tag's coding sequence should be in frame, right? If the HA has a stop codon inserted or a frameshift occurred, that could cause this. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence wasn't correctly added, leading to a premature stop.

Wait, the person is using a plasmid where the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. They probably cloned the HA sequence into the construct. If during cloning, a stop codon was introduced before the actual HA sequence, that would cause the issue. Alternatively, perhaps the reading frame is shifted, leading to a premature stop.

Looking at the given sequence, the first 9 codons after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC GCC AAA TGA. Wait, but the HA tag's DNA sequence is longer than that. So I think the issue is that the HA tag's coding sequence was not correctly cloned, leading to the premature stop codon.

Wait, the question says they introduced the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. But if the HA is not correctly cloned, the reading frame could be off, leading to a premature stop.

Another angle: The stop codon (TGA) is in the wrong place. The first part of the coding sequence after the ATG is HA, but the stop is coming too early. So the HA's coding sequence is being cut short, causing the protein not to be expressed.

Looking at the options, option B says "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That would happen if there's a stop codon in the construct. Which in this case, the TGA is present early on.

But why is there a TGA stop codon in the construct? Probably because the HA tag's sequence was inserted incorrectly, leading to a frameshift or incorrect reading frame that introduced a stop codon.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the HA tag's coding sequence was correctly cloned, but the vector's multiple cloning site (MCS) has a stop codon. Or perhaps the HA tag's sequence has a stop codon due to a mutation.

Wait, the options are:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

In the given sequence, the stop codon is TGA, which is a valid stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate early. So option B would be correct. But why is the stop codon present?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is followed by this stop codon, so the protein isn't expressed beyond that. So the HA tag isn't even fully formed, and the GADD45G isn't expressed either.

Looking back, the given plasmid's sequence starts with ATG (start), then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTA (Val), TCC (Ser), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (stop). So the HA tag is supposed to be YPYDVPDYA, which is longer than these 9 nucleotides. So in this case, the HA coding sequence is incomplete, leading to a stop codon. So the HA's coding sequence is incorrect, perhaps a frameshift or a mutation.

But the options don't directly say that the HA coding sequence is incorrect. Option A says the HA has a missense mutation. So maybe there's a mutation that changes an amino acid, but the reading frame is correct. But in this case, the presence of TGA is a stop, so that's a nonsense mutation. So that would result in a truncated protein. So the HA would not be correctly formed, and the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed.

Alternatively, the construct is missing a crucial part, like the HA tag isn't there or the reading frame is wrong. But the problem is that the plus strand is given, and the issue is in the sequence.

Wait, the question says they modified the gene by introducing the HA determinant at the N-terminus. So perhaps the HA coding sequence overlaps the start codon. Or maybe the HA sequence is in a different reading frame.

Hmm, but the start codon is correct. So the issue is in the HA sequence leading to a premature stop.

So the correct answer seems to be that the construct has a premature stop codon in the HA coding sequence. So the ribosome would terminate early, making the HA tag incomplete and preventing the expression of GADD45G.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That fits because the TGA is a stop codon. But why is the stop codon there? Maybe due to a cloning error in the HA sequence, leading to a frameshift or an incorrect reading frame. Or perhaps the HA sequence was not correctly cloned, leading to the stop codon.

Wait, the reason they couldn't overexpress the protein is because the HA tag isn't being expressed properly. So the initial part of the construct has a stop codon, making the HA tag incomplete. If the HA isn't present, the protein won't be expressed, or only a small peptide is made, which might not be detected.

So the reason is that the HA coding sequence has a stop codon, leading to termination. So the answer would be B. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence is okay, but the construct has a stop codon elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's coding sequence isn't in frame with the start codon. Let's see. The HA sequence's DNA should be in the same reading frame as the GADD45G gene.

But the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC GCC AAA TGA... So the HA sequence is correct in the first few codons, but then a stop comes in. So this suggests that the HA coding sequence is correct for a few amino acids but then ends with a stop. So the problem is that the HA sequence is followed by a stop codon, leading to a short peptide and no GADD45G.

So the root cause is that the HA coding sequence is followed by a stop codon, which is why the protein isn't overexpressed. Therefore, the ribosome stops early, which is option B.

Alternatively, option A suggests a missense mutation in HA. But a missense would not cause a premature stop, unless the mutation is a nonsense. So if the HA's sequence has a mutation that creates a stop codon, then A would be the case. But in the given sequence, the stop codon is TGA, which is the third codon in the triplet. So perhaps the HA's correct coding sequence should have continued beyond, but due to a mutation, a TGA was introduced.

Wait, perhaps the HA coding sequence was supposed to be longer, but in the given construct, it's cut short. So the HA's coding sequence is wrong, leading to a premature stop. So the issue is that the HA's coding sequence has a premature stop, which would be a frameshift. But the question's options don't directly address this.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA coding sequence is correct, but another issue is preventing expression. For example, the lack of a linker (option C) could cause proteolysis, but the question says the protein can't be overexpressed, which suggests the issue is at the transcription/translation level, not post-translational.

Option D is about the tRNA for UAA. But the stop codon is TGA, which is recognized by release factors, so it's not dependent on a tRNA. So D is incorrect.

So the problem is that the construct introduces a stop codon, leading to early termination. So option B is correct.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with a hemagglutinin (HA) determinant at the N-terminus, fails to overexpress the protein. The provided DNA sequence shows that the coding sequence starts with ATG (start codon), followed by TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTA (Val), TCC (Ser), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), and TGA (stop codon). This indicates that the ribosome terminates translation prematurely after only 9 amino acids, far before the HA tag and GADD45G protein are fully expressed.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.**  
   A missense mutation would alter an amino acid, but it would not introduce a premature stop codon like TGA. The presence of TGA suggests a frameshift or a premature termination, not just a single amino acid change. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.**  
   The sequence contains the stop codon TGA, which is recognized by the ribosome, leading to premature termination of translation. This matches the observed issue of incomplete protein expression. This is the most plausible explanation.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.**  
   Proteolysis occurs post-translationally, but the issue here is that the protein is not being expressed at all due to early termination. This makes this option irrelevant.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.**  
   The stop codon in question is TGA, not UAA. Additionally, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, so this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The premature stop codon TGA in the construct causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length HA-tagged GADD45G protein from being expressed. This aligns with option B.

Answer: B
