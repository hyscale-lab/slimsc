Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. So, I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

First, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. Under basic conditions like NaOEt, it would deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate would then attack the beta position of the other reactant, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. 

Wait, what's the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate? The structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituents in the E configuration. But wait, the substituents would actually be the p-tolyl group and the methyl ester on either side. Let me visualize this: The acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the (E) configuration would have the higher priority groups on opposite sides. Hmm, maybe the actual structure is more like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group attached to the alpha carbon? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula given is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, right? So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so, 3-position would be the methyl ester part... No, maybe it's the position
