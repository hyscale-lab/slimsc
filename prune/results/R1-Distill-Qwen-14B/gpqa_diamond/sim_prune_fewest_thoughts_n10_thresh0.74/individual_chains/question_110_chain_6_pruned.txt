Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question gives me some details about each star and the brightness limits of each instrument.

Let me try to break this down. The key points I need to consider are the apparent V magnitude of each star because both spectrographs have different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, meaning it can detect stars with apparent magnitudes less than or equal to 17. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so it can detect up to 16 mag. Wait, no—wait, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag" and "brighter than 16 V mag." Wait, I think it's the other way around—apparent magnitude is a measure where lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means it's magnitude is less than 17, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, it can observe stars with V mag up to 17. HIRES can observe up to 16. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 to be visible by HIRES, and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag needs to be <=16 because that’s the stricter condition. Because if it's brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17, so both would see it. But if it's fainter than 16, then HIRES wouldn't see it, but ESPRESSO could.

Wait, let me get this straight. The question says: ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, apparent V < 17? Because higher magnitudes mean dimmer. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would mean its magnitude is less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so their apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 16.

So to be detected by both, a star's apparent V
