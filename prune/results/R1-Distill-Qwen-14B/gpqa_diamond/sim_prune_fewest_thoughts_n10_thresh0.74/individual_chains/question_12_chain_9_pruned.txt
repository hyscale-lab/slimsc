Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think for this problem, we can assume the neutrino is massless, or maybe it's considered to have negligible mass compared to the others. So the neutrino's rest mass is like zero.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to each other. So p_mu = -p_nu, which means their magnitudes are the same: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Let's think about the conservation of energy first. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion because it's stationary: E_initial = m_pi cÂ² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy (since E =
