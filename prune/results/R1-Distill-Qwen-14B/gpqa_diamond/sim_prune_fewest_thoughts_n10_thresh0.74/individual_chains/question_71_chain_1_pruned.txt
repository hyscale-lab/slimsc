Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature has to do with the balance between the incoming energy from the star and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσd²) ) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law and the fourth power for blackbody radiation.

Wait, the planets are in orbital resonance and have periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, meaning it's closest to the star, right? Because orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. Oh right, Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So T² ∝ a³.

So if Planet_2 has a period twice that of Planet_1, then (T2/T1) = 2. So T2² = (a2³)/(a1³) * T1². Wait, no, more accurately, (a2/a1) = (T2² / T1²)^(1/3) = (2²)^(1/3) = 2^(2/3) ≈ 1.5874. So a2 is about 1.587 times a1.

But the question is about equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So let's get their periods.
