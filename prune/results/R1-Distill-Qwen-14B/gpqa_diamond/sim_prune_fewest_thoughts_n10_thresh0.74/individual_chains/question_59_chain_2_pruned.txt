Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to consider their neutralization. Strong acids and strong bases will react completely, while weak acids might not. So let's think about each component.

CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the first thing I should do is figure out how much H+ and OH- are in each solution and see which one is in excess.

Wait, but each solution is a different volume and concentration, so I need to calculate the moles of each before mixing. Moles are calculated by multiplying molarity (M) by volume (L). Oh right, and the volumes are in mL, so I'll need to convert them to liters.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each substance.

1. For CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L) = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely, but I'll have to think about whether it's in excess after neutralization.

2. For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely, giving 0.08 moles H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: It's a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, which means 0.18 moles of OH-.

Wait a minute, so when I mix all these together, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. But wait, CH3COOH is weak. Does it contribute H+ in the same way as a strong acid? Hmm. Because HCl is strong, it will completely donate H+. But CH3COOH only donates some H+. So how much H+ is actually available from CH3COOH before reacting with the OH-?

But wait, perhaps I should consider all the H+ sources. Let me think: the strong acid HCl will provide a lot of H+ quickly.
