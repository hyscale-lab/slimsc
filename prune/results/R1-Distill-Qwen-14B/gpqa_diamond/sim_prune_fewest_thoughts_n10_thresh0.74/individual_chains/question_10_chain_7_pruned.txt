Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. The question is asking which one has the highest density. Let's see the options again.

The options are a, b, c, d. Each describes a planet with certain characteristics. I need to figure out which one has the highest density.

Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. So, I need to find which planet has the highest mass-to-volume ratio.

Looking at each option:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because that's what I remember from Earth's stats.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and density approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but if the density is the same as Earth, then even though it's more massive, if it's twice the mass, how does that affect the radius? Because volume depends on radius cubed. Let me think. If density is the same, then mass is proportional to volume. Volume is proportional to radius^3. So, if the mass is twice Earth's, the radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. So, radius is about 1.26 times Earth's. So, for this planet, its density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So density here is same as a.

c) Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density. Because composition affects density. So, density is 5.5. But if the mass is 5 times Earth's, then the radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. Cube root of 5 is about 1.71, so radius is larger. So, same density as Earth. So, same as a and b.

d) Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So, density same as Earth, 5.5. But radius would be smaller. Cube root of 0.5 is about 0.793, so radius is about 0.79 Earth radii. So, same density as the others.

Wait wait, but the question is which has the highest density. So, if all options a, b, c, d have same density as Earth, then the answer would be they all have the same density. But that's not possible because one of them must be higher.

Wait, maybe I
