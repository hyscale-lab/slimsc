Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what reagent A and catalyst B are used in the reaction.

Let me start by visualizing the structures. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a pyrrolidine ring with a methyl group on the third carbon. The product is a substituted pyrrolidine where the 1-position has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, right? So the substituent is a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (CHâ‚‚) to the pyrrolidine.

So the reaction is probably forming a new ring or adding a substituent. Since it's an acid-catalyzed reaction, maybe it's an alkylation or some kind of addition.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. In acid-catalyzed reactions, amines can undergo various things. For example, they can act as nucleophiles in alkylation reactions, especially in the presence of a catalyst. Alternatively, they might undergo some kind of ring-opening or participate in a condensation reaction.

The product has a cyclohexene ring attached. So maybe we're looking at some kind of cycloaddition or conjugate addition. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed alkylation where the amine attacks an electrophilic center.

Looking at the options, reagent A is either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. Let's think about each possibility.

Option A: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is TsOH. TsOH is a strong acid, para-toluenesulfonic acid. Aldehydes can undergo various reactions under acidic conditions. Maybe it's a crossed aldol addition or some kind of acylation. But wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine. How would an aldehyde react with that?

Another possibility is that the aldehyde is undergoing a
