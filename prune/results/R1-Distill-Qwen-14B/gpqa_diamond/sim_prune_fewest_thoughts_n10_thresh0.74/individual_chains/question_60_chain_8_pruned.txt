Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, the scenario is an astronaut from another galaxy is traveling to Earth at a super high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The question is asking how long the trip would take from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, wait. So the astronaut is 22 years old. Their average lifetime is about 150 solar years. So, if the trip takes too long in their own frame of reference, they might not survive. But wait, because of relativity, their experienced time would be different.

I remember that when you're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time dilation occurs. The faster you go, the more time slows down relative to a stationary observer. But from the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth would be contracted, so the trip would seem shorter.

Wait, but the question is from the astronaut's point of view. So, we need to calculate the proper time experienced by them. Oh right, the proper time is the time experienced by the traveler, which is the shortest time possible.

Wait, the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud—what's the actual distance? Oh, wait, the problem probably expects me to use a known figure. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, but the astronaut is traveling at 0.99999987c, which is very close to c. So, how does that affect the time?

Let me think. From Earth's frame, the distance is about 160,000 light-years. At 0.99999987c, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So time t = 160,000 ly / 0.99999987c. Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, the time would be roughly 160000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / 1 = 160,000 years. Oh wait, that's way too long. But that's from Earth's perspective.

But the astronaut's own experienced time is different because of time dilation. The formula for time dilation is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, since v is so close to c, maybe I can approximate gamma, the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).

Wait, let me compute that. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2. Well, 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013. So, (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is very small. So, (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00000013) = 1 - 0.0000
