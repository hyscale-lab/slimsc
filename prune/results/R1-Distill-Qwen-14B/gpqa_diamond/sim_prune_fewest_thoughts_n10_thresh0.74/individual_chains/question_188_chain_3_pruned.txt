Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices. Wait, what's the formula again?

Oh right, the formula for interplanar spacing d_hkl in a crystal is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )) ), but wait, no, that doesn't sound exactly right. Or was it another form? I think for a cubic system, it's simpler, but here it's rhombohedral, so all angles are the same. Oh wait, wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice is still cubic but with all edges equal and angles equal. So maybe the formula for interplanar distance is similar to cubic but adjusted for the angles.

Wait, maybe the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )). But since it's a rhombohedral system, all the angles α, β, γ are equal to 30 degrees. So cos α = cos β = cos γ = cos 30°, which is sqrt(3)/2, right?

So, the general formula for d_hkl is a / sqrt( h² + k²
