Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again. The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base). The options are A to D. 

Hmm, right, when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the first thing I should do is figure out the total moles of H+ ions from the acids and the total moles of OH- ions from the bases. Then, determine which one is in excess. If one ion is in excess, the solution will be either acidic or basic depending on which ion is left.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I'll calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with the acetic acid, CH3COOH. Its concentration is 0.1 M, and the volume is 500 mL. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but in this case, since we're mixing with HCl and Ba(OH)2, I think the strong acid and base will have a bigger impact here.

Next, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Its concentration is 0.2 M, volume 400 mL. So moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. Each HCl gives one H+ and one Cl-.

Then, Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so it dissociates completely. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH-. The concentration is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL. So moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH-, so total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait. OH- and H+ will react. So the H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't contribute much H+ compared to the strong acid HCl. But wait, when you mix all three solutions, you're adding H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2, and the acetic acid may or may not contribute.

But actually, the reaction between H+ and OH- will be the first thing to consider. So let's sum up all H+ and all OH-.

But wait, let me think. The acetic acid (CH3COOH)
