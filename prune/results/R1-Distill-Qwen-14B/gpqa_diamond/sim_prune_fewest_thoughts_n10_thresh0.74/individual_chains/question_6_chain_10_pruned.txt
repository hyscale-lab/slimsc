Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the energy spectrum for a particle moving in a specific potential. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, so it's a function of r and θ in polar coordinates. I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials that depend on r but not θ are easier to handle because they have spherical symmetry. But here, the potential depends on θ as well because of the cos²θ term. So this isn't spherically symmetric; it's got some angular dependence.

I think this suggests that the problem might involve separation of variables in spherical coordinates. I remember that in spherical coordinates, the Hamiltonian can be broken down into radial and angular parts. So maybe I can separate the wavefunction into a radial part and an angular part.

Wait, the potential can be written as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, because 1/2 kr² plus 3/2 kr² cos²θ is the same as (1/2)kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ). Oh, right, because 1/2 +3/2 = 2, but wait no, wait: 1/2 kr² multiplied by (1 + 3 cos²θ) gives the original expression.

So the potential is V(r) multiplied by a function of θ. That suggests that the Hamiltonian, which is the kinetic plus potential energy, can be split into a radial part and an angular part. Because the potential is separable into r and θ terms, the Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of the radial Hamiltonian and the angular (like a harmonic oscillator) part.

Wait, but the kinetic part is more complicated. The kinetic energy in spherical coordinates is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²). So the total Hamiltonian H is [p_r²/(2m) + (1/2) m r² ω² ] + [p_θ²/(2m r²) + (3/2) m r² ω² cos²θ ]? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I
