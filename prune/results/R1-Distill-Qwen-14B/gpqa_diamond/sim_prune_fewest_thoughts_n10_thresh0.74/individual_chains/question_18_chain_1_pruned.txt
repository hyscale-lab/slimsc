Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses compared to the Sun. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, I remember that mass might not directly affect the elemental abundances, so maybe I can ignore that part unless it's about something like stellar evolution, but the problem doesn't mention anything about that. So maybe the mass info is just extra and I can focus on the abundances.

The problem states that astronomers have determined the elemental abundances using the EW method under LTE. The given values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → So log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, the ratio would be (n_Si1 / n_Si2) or (n_Si2 / n_Si1)? Hmm, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2"—so probably n_Si1 divided by n_Si2. Wait, but sometimes ratios are presented as Star_2 to Star_1, so I should double-check.

Wait, the problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that would be Star_1's Si compared to Star_2's Si. So the ratio would be (n_Si1)/(n_Si2). Or maybe the other way around? Hmm, perhaps I should proceed and see.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. For each star, find the abundance of Si relative to H (n_Si/n_H) and then calculate the ratio of these two values.

2. Use the given abundance ratios to find the [X/Y] values, which are the logarithms of the ratios of the element X to Y compared to the Sun.

First, I'll tackle Star_1.

Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0.0 → [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe abundance in Star_1 / Fe abundance in Sun) = 0. So (Fe1/Fe_sun) = 10^0 = 1 → Fe1 = Fe_sun.

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] is log(Si1/Fe1) - log(Si_sun
