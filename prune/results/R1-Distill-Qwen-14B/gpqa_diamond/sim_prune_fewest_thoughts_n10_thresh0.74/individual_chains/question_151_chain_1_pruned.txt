Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting a result of 0. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized. Wait, normalization means the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Let me check that.

So the state vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Let me calculate the norm. (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Sum is 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh wait, that's 6, which is more than 1. So the vector isn't normalized. Oh, but wait, maybe I should consider that the actual state is a normalized version. So perhaps the state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))^T. Because 1/6 +4/6 +1/6 = 6/6=1. Yeah, that makes sense. So the state is normalized.

The observable is represented by matrix P. Let me write down P's elements. First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. So P looks like this:

[ [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Wait, I think I should write this out more clearly. So, the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, I need to find the probability that measuring P yields 0. In quantum mechanics, the observable's eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So I
