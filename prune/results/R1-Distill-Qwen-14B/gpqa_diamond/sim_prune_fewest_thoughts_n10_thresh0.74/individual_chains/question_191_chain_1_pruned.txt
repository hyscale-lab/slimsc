Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure mentally. So the cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (that's a CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2 group attached to a double bond. So it's CH2-C(CH2?), no. Let me think: propene is CH2=CHCH3. The prop-1-en-2-yl group would be the substituent on the second carbon, so it's CH2-C(CH3)- but wait, actually, the group is the propene part where the substituent is on the second carbon. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH(CH2... no, wait. Let me get this right. The structure would be CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2- but in the substituent. Wait, maybe it's (prop-1-en-2-yl) is CH2CH(CH3)- with the double bond. No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- but attached from the second carbon? Hmm. Maybe it's better to think of it as (CH2)CH2 connected via a double bond. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the group CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. No, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2- but attached where? Maybe I'm getting stuck here, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the exact structure isn't critical yet. Let's just note that the starting material has a cyclohexanone ring with a CH2OH at position 3 and a propenyl group at position 5.

First step: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide,
