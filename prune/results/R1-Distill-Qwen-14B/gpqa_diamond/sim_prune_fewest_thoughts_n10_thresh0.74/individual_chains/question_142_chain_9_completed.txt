Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. Hmm, right, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. So, each of the basis states |0> and |1> have equal probability, but since it's a mixed state, it's like a completely random state with no coherence.

I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector on a unit sphere. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. The vector r determines the position on the Bloch sphere.

Let me write out the general form. The density matrix ρ can be expressed as:
ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2

I think σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, substituting these into the equation.

Wait, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. Let's calculate each term:

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]
|1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]
Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So the given ρ is I/2.

So ρ = (I)/2.

Comparing this to the general form, (I + r·σ)/2, the r·σ term must be zero because ρ is I/2. That means r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0. But the only way for this to happen is if all components of r are zero. Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, their coefficients must each be zero. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0.

Therefore, the vector r is (0,0,0). That would place the density matrix at the origin in the Bloch sphere coordinates. But wait, the Bloch sphere is a unit sphere, so the origin is the completely mixed state. Because when r is zero, the state is (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which is exactly what we have here.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which must be the correct answer. The other options are points on the Bloch sphere or other positions. For example, option B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole, corresponding to the pure state |0> or |1>, depending on the phase. Option D is (1,1,1), which doesn't even lie on the unit sphere because its magnitude is sqrt(3), so that can't be right. Option A is (1,1,0), which has a magnitude of sqrt(2), so it's outside the unit sphere. So the only one that fits is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector in 3D space, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), we have 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the term \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) must vanish, meaning \( r_x = r_y = r_z = 0 \). Therefore, the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is at the origin, \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the completely mixed state.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 0) \) is outside the unit sphere and does not correspond to the given \( \rho \).
- **Option B**: \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 1) \) corresponds to a pure state, not the mixed state.
- **Option C**: \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \) correctly represents the completely mixed state.
- **Option D**: \( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 1) \) is outside the unit sphere and does not correspond to the given \( \rho \).

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the origin in the Bloch sphere, representing the given mixed state.

Answer: C
