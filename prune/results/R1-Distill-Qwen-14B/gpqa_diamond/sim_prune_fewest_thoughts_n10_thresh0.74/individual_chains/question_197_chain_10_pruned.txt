Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and we need to identify the final product. The options are A to D.

First, I'll look at the spectral data given: IR and 1H NMR. I remember that IR can tell us about functional groups, and NMR gives structural info, like the environment of the protons.

The IR data shows peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, probably O-H or N-H. But the other peaks are 1720, 1610, 1450 cm-1. 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be C=C (aromatic) stretching. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is probably an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have broad singlets around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but that's a bit lower. So maybe a carboxylic acid group is present.

Then, looking at the aromatic region. 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggests two doublets. That might be a para-substituted benzene ring. So for example, if there are two substituents opposite each other on the benzene ring, like in para positions. The protons on the ring would split into two doublets. So perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, para.

Next, the other peaks. 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to something electronegative, maybe next to an oxygen or a carbonyl. Or perhaps a methylene near a branching.

Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). 1.4 as a doublet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or a CH group. Like in an isopropyl group. Wait, but 1.4 as a doublet with 3H is more like a CH(CH3)2 group, the methyl in a sec-butyl or isobutyl group.

And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a -CH2CH2CH2- group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid, and a branched chain attached. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzyl ketone or ester.

Wait, but the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak. A carboxylic acid has a broad O-H around 3000 and a strong C=O around 1700. But wait, the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually broader than in an alcohol. The IR here has 3400â€“2500 which is a broad range, which might include the O-H stretch.

But looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which fits a carboxylic acid -OH. So maybe the structure is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but let's think about this. If the IR has a 1720 cm-1, that could be a ketone as well. But in that case, the NMR wouldn't have a broad singlet at 10.5. Unless it's an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But then the IR would show
