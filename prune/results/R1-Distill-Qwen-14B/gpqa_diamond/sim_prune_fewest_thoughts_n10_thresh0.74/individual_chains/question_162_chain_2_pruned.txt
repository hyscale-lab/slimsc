Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is like a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given is a bit confusing though.

The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I think this is in two dimensions because it's got dx and dy. So it's a 2D space described by this metric. 

I recall that the area of a surface in 2D can be found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but wait no, actually for area in 2D, the volume form is sqrt(g) dx dy, but when the metric is diagonal like this, sqrt(g) is the square root of (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²), but since it's diagonal, g_xy is zero. So the area element becomes sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy.

Looking at the given metric, it's expressed as (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So in terms of the metric tensor components, g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant would be g_xx * g_yy - 0 = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, but for the area element, it's sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt of (32/(4 - x² - y²))² is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the area of the pseudosphere. Oh wait, pseudosphere in 2D is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given here seems to be in conformal form, which is often used for metrics of constant curvature. The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Wait, the standard metric for a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) in the Poincaré disk model is something like ds² = 4/(1 - (x² + y²))^2 (dx² + dy²). So that's a metric on the unit disk. In that case, the curvature is -1/(R²), where R is the radius. But our metric here is (32)/(4
