Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about the decay of a boson X. The question gives me the Lagrangian, which I remember is a way to describe the dynamics of a physical system. The Lagrangian here is written as L(y) = -λff(y)(ῡψf(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y)). Wait, that might be a typo because the LaTeX seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be something like L = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, wait, probably it's a Yukawa interaction term. Yukawa couplings usually describe the interaction between fermions and a scalar boson, like the Higgs.

So the interaction term here is λ f ψ̄ f (v + X) ψ_f. But I'm not sure what the notation exactly is. Maybe f is a fermion field, and X is the boson. So the interaction is between X and the fermions ψ.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Wait, GeV stands for giga-electron volts, which is a unit of energy. When particles decay, the energy (or mass) of the decaying particle must be sufficient to produce the rest mass of the decay products. So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the lightest possible fermion pair it can decay into, right?

So the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to find which fermion pairs X can decay into. The allowed decays are those where the sum of the rest masses is less than or equal to the mass of X.

Wait, but wait. The X boson is a boson, so when it decays, it must decay into particles that sum up to a system with lower mass. But for a boson like the Higgs, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So the possible decay channels are into any fermion pair as long as their combined mass is less than or equal to X's mass.

So what are the possible fermions here? The options given include pairs like b b
