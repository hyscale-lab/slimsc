Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and then think through what's going on.

So, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. I remember that when matter and antimatter particles collide, they can annihilate into energy, usually in the form of photons. The setup is a bit specific, so I need to pay attention to the details.

The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the electron's gamma is 4. Then the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. So the positron has gamma 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should consider conservation laws here. Since the system is isolated, both energy and momentum must be conserved. Because photons carry both energy and momentum, and in this case, the two photons have the same energy, their momenta must be considered.

Wait, the electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momenta are in opposite directions. Let me think about their energies and momenta before the collision.

For the electron: energy is
