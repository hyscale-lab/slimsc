Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And the question is about its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are A to D, each giving a different point in a 3D space.

Hmm, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. In this case, I think this might be a mixed state because the matrix looks like it's an average of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Wait, no, actually, |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal, so when you take the density matrix, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. That looks familiar—it might be a completely mixed state for a qubit.

I think the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix in this case is a convex combination of the two basis states. So, for a single qubit, the Bloch vector can represent the state. 

Wait, the Bloch vector is a vector (x,y,z) where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For a general density matrix ρ, you can express it in terms of the Bloch vector. The formula is something like ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. So, if I can write ρ in that form, I can find r.

Looking at the given ρ: it's already written as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. Let me compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0, and |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. So when you add them, you get a diagonal matrix with 1 and 1. Multiply by 1/2, you get [[1/2,
