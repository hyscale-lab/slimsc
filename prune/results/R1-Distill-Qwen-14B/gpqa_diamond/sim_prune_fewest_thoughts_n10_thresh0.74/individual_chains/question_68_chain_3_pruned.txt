Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try.

The problem is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu that's aligned with a magnetic field initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then the magnetic field is switched off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Alright, let me break this down. I remember that when a spin-1/2 particle is placed in a magnetic field, its magnetic moment aligns with the field because of the Zeeman effect. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think.

So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's spin will be aligned, so the magnetic moment is along +Z. But when the field is suddenly turned off and another along +Y is turned on, the situation changes. The magnetic field is now in the y-direction, same strength as before.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the moment oscillating. So, oscillation frequency. Hmm. I think this has to do with the time evolution of the spin state under the influence of the new magnetic field.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, when a system is subjected to a Hamiltonian, its time evolution is determined by the Schrödinger equation. The spin-1/2 system has a Hamiltonian proportional to the magnetic field. So the Hamiltonian after the field change would be H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, wait, actually, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is -mu · B. So more accurately, H = - mu · B. So when the field is along y, H = -gamma B S_y.

But wait, the way I remember it, the interaction energy is H = - gamma B (S · direction), which would be H = -gamma B S_y. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the spin-1/2 particle has spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. But the initial state was aligned with the z-field. So initially, the state was either |+z> or |-z>, right?

Wait, but wait. The initial state was with the magnetic field along z, so the system was in an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it was |+z>, the eigenstate with Sz = ħ/2. Because when the field is along z, the system will be in a state aligned with the field, which is |+z> if it's spin-up, or |-z> for spin-down. But does it matter which one we pick? Probably, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the initial state is |+z>.

Now, when the magnetic field is suddenly switched from
