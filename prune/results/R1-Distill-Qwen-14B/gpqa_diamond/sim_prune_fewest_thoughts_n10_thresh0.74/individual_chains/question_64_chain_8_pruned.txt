Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

So, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which together weigh 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without any air. When heated, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through three different tubes: the first has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second is a Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. 

The results are: tube 1 gains 3.60 grams, tube 3 gains 0.80 grams, and tube 2's weight doesn't change. After this, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left, measured under standard temperature and pressure (STP). The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what each of these tubes does. 

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong desiccant. It's used to absorb water. So if the gas mixture passes through this, any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of water. So, the 3.60 grams increase here probably corresponds to the water vapor in the gas mixture.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. Calcium hydroxide is a base that reacts with acidic gases like CO2. If the weight didn't change, that suggests that the gas mixture didn't have any CO2 or another acidic gas that would react with Ca(OH)2. So maybe the gas that passed through didn't have CO2, or maybe the amount was negligible. Alternatively, perhaps all the CO2 was already absorbed in tube 1, but I don't think Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with CO2. Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent and would trap water, but not CO2. So, if tube 2's weight didn't change, maybe the gas after tube 1 didn't have any CO2 or another acidic gas. Or perhaps the only acidic gas was HCl, which was completely absorbed in another part.

Wait, but then there's tube 3, which is red-hot copper. Red-hot copper would react with certain gases. For example, CO would react with copper to form CO2 and Cu. Alternatively, SO2 might react, but I'm not sure. But the product is CuO, which suggests that the reacting gas was H2S? No, wait, if the gas was H2S, it would react with Cu to produce CuS and water. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, which would react to form CO2 and Cu. Let me think about this.

Wait, red-hot copper in a gas stream. If the gas is CO, then 2CO + Cu → CO2 + CuO. So, the Cu would oxidize and form CuO, which is what's happening here. The 0.80 grams increase in tube 3 suggests that the gas passing through was CO, which was oxidized to CO2. So, the CO was converted into CO2, and the copper oxide (CuO) is what's left, increasing the tube's weight.

But wait, the problem says that CuO is formed in tube 3. So, the reaction must be between CO and Cu. Let me write that reaction. 

The reaction is: 2CO + Cu → CO2 + CuO. So, for every 2 moles of CO consumed, 1 mole of CuO is produced. 

So, the mass increase in tube 3 is the mass of CuO formed. Let me calculate how much
