Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, hold on, quantum states are usually represented as vectors with complex numbers, right? But here the components are real numbers. Hmm, maybe it's just a simplified case.

The operators for P and Q are given as square matrices. The operator P's matrix has the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The Q matrix looks like it's diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P. Wait, no, the wording is: measuring Q just after P. So first P is measured, then Q. So the order is P first, then Q, and we want the probability that P gives 0 and Q gives -1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read again: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?" So in P's measurement, outcome is 0; in Q's, outcome is -1.

But wait, if you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on that new state will give a different probability.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. In quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, we measure P, and if we get 0, the state becomes the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, we measure Q on this new state, and find the probability of getting -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q, and we need the joint probability of P=0 and Q=-1. So the approach is:

1. Find the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0. Because when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to that eigenvector.

2. Then, find the probability that when you measure Q on this new state, you get -1.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the initial state is given, and the measurement of P first. So first, compute the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. Then, given that outcome, compute the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q.

Wait, but the question says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So it's the joint probability: the chance that P's measurement gives 0 and Q's measurement, after that, gives -1.

So the process is: measure P, get 0 (some probability), then measure Q on the new state, get -1 (another probability). Multiply these probabilities to get the joint probability.

Wait, but actually, no. Because the first measurement affects the state. So the correct approach is:

1. Compute the initial state vector. The given state is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Wait, but wait: quantum states are usually normalized. Let me check the normalization. The length squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. But perhaps the problem assumes it's already normalized, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as a vector, and we don't need to normalize yet.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized (i.e., inner product with itself is 1). So the given state is [-1,2,1]^T. Let me compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(6). So the actual state is (1/sqrt(6)) times that vector. So when we compute probabilities, we have to account for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem ignores normalization, but that's unlikely. Hmm.

So the first step is to compute the state after measuring P and getting 0. How?

P's matrix is given. Let me write down matrix P.

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Wait, let me write it correctly.

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm. So to find the eigenvalues of P, maybe?

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to find eigenvectors for P. We need the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue, particularly the eigenvalue 0 because that's the outcome we're interested in.

Alternatively, perhaps P is a Hermitian matrix, which it should be for an observable. Let me check: the elements are real, so it's symmetric. So yes, it's Hermitian.

So the eigenvalues are real. Let me find the eigenvalues of P.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, a, 0], where a=1/sqrt(2)
Row 2: [a, 0, a]
Row 3: [0, a, 0]

Hm. So it's a 3x3 symmetric matrix.

To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me compute the characteristic equation.

So the matrix (P - λ I) is:

Row 1: [-λ, a, 0]
Row 2: [a, -λ, a]
Row 3: [0, a, -λ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - a*a ] - a [ a*(-λ) - a*0 ] + 0 [ ... ]
Wait, expanding along the first row:

= (-λ) * [ ( (-λ)(-λ) - a^2 ) ] - a * [ a*(-λ) - a*0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, the cofactor expansion:

det = (-λ) * det( [ [-λ, a], [a, -λ] ]) ) - a * det( [ [a, a], [0, -λ] ]) ) + 0 * det(...)

Compute each minor:

First minor: det of [[-λ, a],[a, -λ]] = (λ^2 - a^2 )

Second minor: det of [[a, a],[0, -λ]] = (a*(-λ) - a*0 )= - a λ.

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ^2 - a^2) - a*(-a λ) ) 
= (-λ^3 + λ a^2) + a^2 λ 
= (-λ^3 + λ a^2 + λ a^2 )
= -λ^3 + 2 λ a^2.

Set this equal to zero: -λ^3 + 2 λ a^2 = 0
Factor out λ: λ (-λ^2 + 2 a^2 ) = 0.

So eigenvalues are λ=0, and -λ^2 + 2 a^2 =0 → λ^2 = 2 a^2 → λ= ± a sqrt(2).

But wait, a is 1/sqrt(2), so a sqrt(2) is (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) )= 1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, +1, -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1? No, wait:

Wait, in the equation, -λ^3 + 2 λ a^2 =0 → λ ( -λ^2 + 2 a^2 )=0.

So λ=0, and λ^2 = 2 a^2 → λ = ± a sqrt(2).

But a=1/sqrt(2), so a sqrt(2) = 1. So the eigenvalues are 0, +1, -1.

Wait, wait, because when a=1/sqrt(2),  a^2=1/2. So 2 a^2 =1 → λ^2=1 → λ= ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

The eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue are the states the system collapses into upon measuring that eigenvalue.

So first, we need to find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0.

So for P, the eigenvector equation is (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> =0.

So the system is:

Row 1: 0 v1 + (a) v2 + 0 v3 =0 → a v2 =0 → v2=0.

Row 2: a v1 + 0 v2 + a v3 =0 → a (v1 + v3 )=0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0 v1 + a v2 +0 v3 =0 → a v2=0 → v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2 must be 0. Then, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvector is of the form (v1, 0, v3), where v1= -v3.

Let me set v3= t, so v1= -t.

So the eigenvector is (-t, 0, t) = t*(-1, 0, 1). So the eigenvector is proportional to (-1, 0, 1).

But wait, I should check if this satisfies all the equations.

Let me compute P times (-1, 0, 1)^T.

P matrix:

Row 1: [0, a, 0]
Row 2: [a, 0, a]
Row 3: [0, a, 0]

So P*(-1,0,1) is:

Row 1: 0*(-1) + a*0 + 0*(1) =0.

Row 2: a*(-1) + 0*0 + a*(1) = -a +a =0.

Row 3: 0*(-1) + a*0 + 0*(1)=0.

So yes, it gives (0,0,0), so it is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (-1, 0, 1). Let me normalize it.

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1, 0, 1) → which is (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

So when the system is in state |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)^T / sqrt(6), the probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector |v>.

Wait, more accurately, the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6). Because the norm is sqrt(6), so we must normalize it.

Wait, but the initial state is given as a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1), but in quantum mechanics, the state must be a unit vector. So perhaps the problem is assuming that it's already normalized, but that can't be because (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =6, so the norm is sqrt(6), so the vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem didn't normalize, but I think it's necessary for the probabilities to add up.

So let's proceed.

The eigenvector for P=0 is |v0> = ( -1, 0, 1 )^T / sqrt(2).

So the probability of getting P=0 is | <v0 | ψ> |^2.

Compute the inner product:

<v0 | ψ> = ( -1/sqrt(2) )*( -1/sqrt(6) ) + (0/sqrt(2)) * (2/sqrt(6)) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).

The eigenvector is |v0> = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T / sqrt(2).

So the inner product is ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) * (-1)/sqrt(6) + 0 * (2)/sqrt(6) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1)/sqrt(6)

So each term:

= [ (1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

So this is (1 + 1)/(sqrt(12) ) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).

Wait, because sqrt(12)= 2*sqrt(3).

So the inner product is 2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).

So the probability P=0 is |1/sqrt(3)|^2 = 1/3.

Wait, because (1/sqrt(3))^2 is 1/3.

So the probability that P=0 is 1/3.

Now, given that the outcome was P=0, the system is now in the state |v0>, which is ( -1, 0, 1 )^T / sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q on this state. The observable Q has matrix:

Q = diag(1, 0, -1).

So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

The eigenvectors are |q1> = (1,0,0)^T,

|q0> = (0,1,0)^T,

|q-1> = (0,0,1)^T.

So the state |v0> is ( -1, 0, 1 )^T / sqrt(2) = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Now, what's the probability of measuring Q=-1 when the state is |v0> ?

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is |q-1> = (0,0,1)^T.

The inner product is <q-1 | v0> = (0,0,1) [ (-1, 0, 1) / sqrt(2) ]^T = (1)* (1/sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2).

So the probability is |1/sqrt(2)|^2 = 1/2.

Wait, wait, but |v0> is already in the eigenbasis of Q?

Wait, no, because Q's eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, while |v0> is not one of them.

Wait, |v0> is a combination of |q1> and |q-1> because:

|v0> = (-1/sqrt(2)) |q1> + (0) |q0> + (1/sqrt(2)) |q-1>.

So when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. The probability of each outcome is the square of the amplitude for the corresponding eigenvector.

So the amplitude for Q=-1 is the third component, which is 1/sqrt(2).

So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but wait: when the state is |v0>, the probability to get Q=-1 is the modulus squared of the component in the |q-1> direction.

Which is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/2.

So the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when you measure P first and get 0, the state collapses to |v0>. Then, when you measure Q, you get -1 with probability 1/2.

So the joint probability is (probability P=0) * (probability Q=-1 given P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the P=0 probability.

Wait, let me double-check the inner product.

|v0> is [ -1, 0, 1 ] / sqrt(2).

|ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6).

So their inner product is:

( (-1)(-1) )/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) + (0)(2)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + (1)(1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).

Which is (1 + 0 + 1 ) / (sqrt(12)) )= 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).

So the square is 1/3, which is correct.

So the probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the answer should be option D: 1/6.


The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), on a quantum system. The initial state of the system is given as \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} / \sqrt{6} \), where the normalization factor \( \sqrt{6} \) ensures the state vector has unit norm. The operators \( P \) and \( Q \) are represented by the matrices:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}, \quad 
Q = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). This yields eigenvalues \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is found by solving \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). The resulting eigenvector is:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} / \sqrt{2}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the overlap between the initial state \( |\psi\rangle \) and the eigenvector \( |v_0\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{0}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = |\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after \( P = 0 \) measurement
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the system collapses to the state \( |v_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} / \sqrt{2} \).

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The observable \( Q \) has eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors:

\[
|q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
|q_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
|q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the overlap between \( |v_0\rangle \) and \( |q_{-1}\rangle \):

\[
\langle q_{-1} | v_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\langle q_{-1} | v_0 \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Joint probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
