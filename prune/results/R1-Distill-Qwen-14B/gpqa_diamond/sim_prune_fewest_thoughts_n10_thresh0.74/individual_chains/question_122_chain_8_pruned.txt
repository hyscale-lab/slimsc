Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It involves a series of reactions starting with acetic acid and ending up with some product 4. I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen signals are in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, let me try to follow each reaction and see what each product might be. The starting material is acetic acid. So, the first reaction is treating it with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Wait, what's that? Oh right, that's a typical bromination reaction. Acetic acid has a -COOH group. When you brominate it under these conditions, I think it undergoes acetylation first maybe, or substitution.

Wait, acetic anhydride is often used as an acetylating agent. Oh wait, but with bromine and pyridine, maybe it's a bromination reaction. Pyridine is often used to absorb HBr, which is a byproduct in such reactions. So, perhaps the reaction is adding a bromine atom to the acetic acid.

Acetic acid has a structure of CH3COOH. When you brominate it, where does the bromine go? I think it's a substitution on the alpha position. The alpha carbons are the methyl group next to the carbonyl. So, the reaction would substitute one of the hydrogens on the methyl group with bromine. So product 1 would be bromoacetic acid, specifically 2-bromoacetic acid? Wait, no, the structure would be CH2BrCOOH. Wait, no, because the methyl is CH3, the substitution would make it CH2BrCOOH? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, no, the starting material is acetic acid, which is CH3COOH. If the bromine substitutes one of the methyl hydrogens, then the product would be CH2BrCOOH, but wait, that can't be right because the methyl is CH3, so substitution would yield CH2BrCOOH. Oh, wait, but wait, wait: the methyl group in acetic acid is attached to the carbonyl, so the alpha carbons are the methyl. So, bromination would replace one H on CH3 with Br, making CH2BrCOOH. So product 1 is bromoacetic acid, I think.

Next step: product 1
