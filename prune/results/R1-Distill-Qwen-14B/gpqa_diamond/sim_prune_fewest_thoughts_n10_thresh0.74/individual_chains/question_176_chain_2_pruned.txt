Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem says the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that can't be right because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors. Let me check: the magnitude squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the vector is probably normalized by dividing each component by sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is |ψ> = 1/sqrt(6) * (-1, 2, 1).

The operators for P and Q are given. Let me look at them. The P operator is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, that looks a bit like a spin matrix but I'm not sure. The Q operator is diagonal: (1, 0, -1) on the diagonal, so it's 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring Q after P. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Wait, but when you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P, right? Then, measuring Q on that new state.

Wait, but wait. The measurement of P would project the state into an eigenstate of P. So the first step is to find the possible eigenvalues of P and their corresponding eigenvectors. Then, the state after measuring P will be the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, using that new state, measure Q and find the probability of getting -1.

Wait, but actually, the problem says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q." So I think that's the joint probability. So first, the system is in state |ψ>. When we measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. We want the
