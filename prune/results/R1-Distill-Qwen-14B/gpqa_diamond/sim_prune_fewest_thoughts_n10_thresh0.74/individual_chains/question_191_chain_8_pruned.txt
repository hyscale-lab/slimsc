Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the structure of product 4. Let me go through each step carefully.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main ring is cyclohexan-1-one, so a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be like CH2-C(CH2? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, but prop-1-en-2-yl would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent at C2. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH3)-, but attached where? Oh wait, no, wait. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2, so it's CH2=CHCH2-? No, wait the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)- attached? Maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH(CH2-) but with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)2C=CH2? No, maybe it's CH2=C(CH2-) something? Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH(CH2-) with a double bond between 1 and 2, so it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)CH2-CH2 but no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2- group? But then it's propenyl, not prop-1-en-2-yl. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, and the substituent on C2? So structure would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached? Or is it CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, but the substituent is on C2, so the group would be CH2-CH(CH2-) something? Maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me just move on and see if it matters.

So the first step is treating this with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used for deprotonating things. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So probably an alkylation reaction. Where would the deprotonation happen? The starting material has a ketone (cyclohexanone). The alpha positions are the hydroxymethyl (position 3) and the propenyl group (position 5). Wait, but
