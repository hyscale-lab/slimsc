Okay, I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me try to break it down.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then, a reaction involving a keto acid and X produces a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's noted for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. Let's start by identifying the possible substances involved.

First, looking at gas W: its molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Think about common gases. Maybe H2O? No, because H2O has H and O. Wait, let's calculate. For water, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since it's usually O-16). So the molecule: H2O has 2 H (each contributing 1p, 0n) and 1 O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2 +8=10; neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

What about CO2? CO2 has C (6p, 6n) and two O (8p, 8n each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. Oh! Wait, that matches. So gas W is CO2. Because 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W is carbon dioxide.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: maybe something like NH3? Let's see: N has 7p, 7n? No, wait, N is usually N-14, which has 7p and 7n. H has 1p, 0n. So NH3 would have 7 +3*1 =10 protons, and 7 + 0 =7 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe something else. Wait, another option: O2? O2 has each O as 8p and 8n. So O2 molecule: 16p, 16n. So protons and neutrons are equal. That could be it. Or O3? But O3 would have 24p and 24n, same thing. So W could be O2 or O3. But O2 is more likely, as it's a common gas.

Wait, but earlier I thought CO2 also fits. Let me recheck. For CO2, each molecule has 1 C (6p,6n) and 2 O (8p,8n each). So total protons: 6 + (8*2) = 6+16=22. Total neutrons: 6 + (8*2) =22. So yes, CO2 also fits.

So, which one is it? Let's think about
