Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details.

The state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So that's the standard basis for spin-½ particles, I think. The z-component of spin, S_z, with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for up and down, respectively.

The question is asking for two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix elements are given as Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that matrix... Hmm. Let me think about what that looks like.

For a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2, representing up and down. So A12 = ħ/2, A21 = ħ/2. The diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix is off-diagonal with ħ/2 in both positions. So the matrix A looks like:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Oh wait, that's similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
So A would be (ħ/2) * σx. Interesting.

But wait, the operator is A, which is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of σx, right? Because A = (ħ/2) σx. So the eigenstates are the eigenstates of σx, which are the spin states in the x-direction.

So the eigenstates of A would be |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2, and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

But the question is about the probabilities of measuring the system in each eigenstate of A. So we need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

Wait, but hold on. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I should normalize it first because the given state is only proportional, not necessarily normalized. Let me compute the norm.

The norm squared is (1+i) times (1-i) for the up component, which is (1+1) = 2, multiplied by the magnitude squared, so (1+i) has magnitude sqrt(2), so |1+i|^2 = 2. Similarly, the down component is (2 - i), so |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the
