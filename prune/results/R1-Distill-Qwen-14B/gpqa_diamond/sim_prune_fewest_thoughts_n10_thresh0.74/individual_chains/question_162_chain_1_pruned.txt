Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²)(dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit unfamiliar. I remember that metrics are used to describe the geometry of spacetime, right? Oh wait, no, this is probably a 2-dimensional metric, maybe in some coordinate system.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. In 2D, the pseudosphere would have a metric that's hyperbolic. But the options here are about the area, so I need to figure out what the area is.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. I think the radius in hyperbolic geometry is a bit different than in flat space. Oh, right, for hyperbolic space, the area of a sphere (well, a circle, since it's 2D) would be 2πr * (cosh(r) - 1) or something like that? Or maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The metric given is in terms of x and y, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a coordinate system that's conformally flat, since the dx² + dy² is scaled by a factor that depends on x and y.

Wait, so the metric is conformally flat because it's written as e^{2φ}(dx
