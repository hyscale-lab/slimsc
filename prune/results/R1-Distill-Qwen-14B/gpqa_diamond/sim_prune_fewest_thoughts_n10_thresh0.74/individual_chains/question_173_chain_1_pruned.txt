Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question is about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, right? Let me think.

Okay, the problem says an electron is traveling at a speed v of 2e8 m/s along the x-direction. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. 

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The principle is often written as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, and since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, we'll probably use the equality Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

So, let's break it down. First, I need to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Once I have that, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy. But wait, how does momentum relate to energy? Oh, right, for a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in momentum squared, divided by twice the mass.

Wait, but let me make sure. The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in E, ΔE, would be (Δp²)/(2m), assuming that the relation is linear and we can take the derivative or something. Alternatively, I might need to use the uncertainty principle for energy and time, but no, the problem gives me a spatial uncertainty, so I think the position and momentum uncertainty are the right approach.

So, first, calculate Δp. Using Δx * Δp = ħ/2. I know Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So, plugging in the numbers:

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0
