Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using some spectroscopic data. Let me jot down the given information and see what I can figure out.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be like a benzene ring (which accounts for 4, since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds, but wait, the ring is one, and three double bonds would be three, so 4 in total) plus another double bond or ring. So maybe the benzene ring plus an ester group or amide or something.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Those are probably N-H stretches. Amide or amine groups? Amides usually have two N-H stretches, which could be around 3300-3500. The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone, but considering the options, probably an ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → This is probably a CH3 group attached to something electronegative, maybe an oxygen, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 (since triplet is for two neighboring protons). So maybe -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) or an ethyl ester.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → Broad singlet. Could be an NCH2 group, like in an amide where the protons are next to the amide nitrogen. Or maybe a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative group. Alternatively, maybe a methylene next to oxygen, but the singlet suggests no splitting, so maybe it's a deshielded group without neighboring protons. Or perhaps this is a -NCH2- group, where the protons are exchanged or something, making it broad.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → Quartet, so probably a CH2 next to another CH2. Since quartet is four peaks, that's from two neighboring protons. So maybe -OCH2CH2- or something. Wait, but the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than typical OCH2 (like in esters), which might be around 4.1-4.3. Hmm, but maybe it's an ester group. Like OCH2 in an ethyl ester. Wait, but ethyl esters usually have two sets: the CH3 as triplet around 1.2 and the OCH2 as quartet around 4.1-4.3. But here, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's part of an amide or another group.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) → These are aromatic protons. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. So two doublets, each integrating to 2H, likely a para-substituted aromatic ring, such as para-substituted with a nitro group, carbonyl, or another EWG.

Looking at the options:
