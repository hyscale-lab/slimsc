Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. It has two parts: part A and part B. The options given are A to D, each pairing answers for A and B.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about identifying which of two compounds doesn't show tautomerism (A) and which of two other compounds shows optical isomerism (B). 

Let me break down each part.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shifting of a double bond, leading to different structural isomers. Tautomerism usually occurs in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups, like in aromatic rings or certain cyclic ketones.

Benzoquinone: Benzoquinone, I think, is a quinone. Quinones generally have conjugated carbonyl groups. For example, para-benzoquinone has two keto groups opposite each other. I also recall that quinones can undergo tautomerism, called keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but waitâ€”tautomerism usually requires at least two adjacent carbonyl groups for the hydrogen shift. Or maybe not? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone isn't the best candidate for tautomerism because the carbonyls are in a conjugated system, but perhaps the structure doesn't allow for the necessary shift. Or maybe it can't tautomerize because the positions are too far apart.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This compound has three ketone groups in a six-membered ring, each at positions 1,3,5. So they are spaced two carbons apart. So, could this compound undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism would require a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. But wait, in a trione, each carbonyl is in a position that's not adjacent to another. Wait, no. Let me visualize it. The ring is six-membered, and the ketones are at 1,3,5. So
