Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. 

First, I need to recall what red phosphorus and HI do in a reaction. Oh, wait, that's usually for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but wait, no. Wait, wait. Oh, right! Red phosphorus is used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) cleavage reaction, often called the Hoffman degradation. Wait, no, maybe that's for amines. Hmm. Or perhaps it's the cleavage of triple bonds? No, wait. Oh, right! The reaction where alkenes or alkynes are treated with HI and red phosphorus. I think that's for the hydration of alkynes or the cleavage of double bonds. Or maybe it's for the addition across double bonds. 

Wait, no. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, the starting material here doesn't have a nitrile. Let me think again. Oh! It's the cleavage of alkenes. When you have a di-substituted or more alkene and treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it adds HI across the double bond, leading to the opening of the double bond. But wait, for more substituted alkenes, like when there's branching, maybe it leads to carbocation rearrangements. 

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, let me draw that structure mentally. It's a cyclohexene ring. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 3 is the double bond. So, the ring is cyclohexene (double bond between C3 and C4?), and at C2 is a formyl group (CHO), and at C5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a substituent at C2 being a formyl (CHO) group, and at C5 a vinyl (CH2=CH-) group.

So, now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think in such a reaction, the double bonds in the molecule might undergo some addition or cleavage. But wait, the molecule has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and another in the vinyl group. So, cyclohex-3-ene has a double bond, and the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) also has a double bond.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI usually add to alkynes, not alkenes. Wait, no. The reaction of HI with alkenes would typically be an addition. But wait, when HI is used with red phosphorus, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh! Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Red phosphorus is used with HI in the cleavage of nitriles to amines, but maybe that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, when an alkene reacts with HI, it's an acid-catalyzed addition. For example, in the case of alkenes, HI adds across the double bond, leading to a diiodide. But wait, if there are multiple double bonds, like in this molecule, would both be attacked? Let me think about the structure again.

The starting material has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (C3 and C4) and the vinyl group (C5 has a CH2-CH2 with a double bond perhaps between C5 and the adjacent carbon, but wait, the vinyl group is attached to C5, so it's CH2=CH-. So, the structure at C5 is CH2-CH2 with a double bond, so the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So, in this case, the molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group. Now, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps both double bonds undergo addition. But wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a dihydroxylation or some kind of diiodide formation.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydration of alkynes. No, that's for making ketones. Alternatively, another possibility: the reaction could be the hydrolysis of a halogenated compound. Wait, but the starting material doesn't have any halogens. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI across each double bond, leading to diiodides.

Wait, but if both double bonds react, then the product would have two more iodide groups. Let me think about how that would affect the structure.

But wait, maybe the vinyl group and the cyclohexene ring are subjected to different reactions. Let me think about each one.

First, the cyclohexene ring (C3). When an alkene reacts with HI, it adds across the double bond, but if there's a possibility of carbocation rearrangement, it might form a more stable carbocation. So, in the cyclohexene ring, adding HI would give a cyclohexyl iodide with the iodine attached where the double bond was. But wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond, so adding HI would give a trans diiodide? Or just a vicinal diiodide.

Wait, no. When you add HI to an alkene, it does so in a two-step process: first, the proton adds to one end, making a carbocation, and then the iodide attacks. For example, in cyclohexene, adding HI would give cyclohexyl iodide with the iodine across the double bond. But wait, in more substituted alkenes, if the carbocation can rearrange, it might.

Wait, but in this molecule, the cyclohexene is substituted with a formyl group at C2 and a vinyl group at C5. So, the cyclohexene ring is at position 3 (C3 and C4). So, adding HI could lead to a diiodide across C3 and C4, but perhaps the position where the iodide adds could depend on the stability of the carbocation formed.

Wait, another possibility is that when the cyclohexene ring undergoes addition of HI, the iodide would end up on the more substituted carbon. Because the carbocation would form on the more substituted carbon, which is more stable. So, in the cyclohexene ring, adding HI would give a 3-iodo- and 4-iodo-cyclohexane structure, but wait, the ring is six-membered, so maybe the addition would give a vicinal diiodide.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about each double bond separately. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond (let's say between C3 and C4) and a substituent at C2 (formyl) and C5 (vinyl). So, when HI adds, for the cyclohexene part, the addition would be across C3 and C4, leading to a cyclohexane ring with iodine on C3 and C4.

Wait, but the vinyl group is another double bond. So, the group at C5 is CH2=CH-. When HI adds to that, it would add across the double bond, giving CH2-I-CH2-? Or CH2-CH2-I? No, wait, adding HI to CH2=CH- would give CH2-I-CH2-I? Or perhaps CH2-I-CH2 with some arrangement.

Wait, no. For a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), adding HI would form CH2-I-CH2-I, but that's not correct. Wait, no. The correct addition of HI to an alkene would be a vicinal diiodide. So, CH2=CH2 reacting with HI would become CH2-I-CH2-I. But wait, that's for ethylene. So, in the vinyl group, the reaction would add two iodines across the double bond, converting it into a CH2-I-CH2- group attached to the ring.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: when you treat a diene with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it leads to a cleavage. I think I'm confusing different reactions here. Oh! Maybe I should think about the possibility of the double bonds undergoing cleavage instead of addition.

Wait, I remember that when HIO (periodic acid) is used, it cleaves vicinal diols into carbonyl groups. But that's for ozonolysis or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the reaction here is the cleavage of the double bonds, not addition.

Wait, another thought: when H2SO4 and H2O are used, they can add across double bonds, but with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the double bonds are being converted into something else.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up reactions. Let me think again. Red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. For example, RCN + H2O (with red phosph.) → RCH2NH2. But in this case, the starting material doesn't have a nitrile group. So, that's not relevant.

Wait, then what else? Oh! Maybe it's the hydration of alkynes. But our starting molecule doesn't have any alkynes; it has alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydride shift or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to both double bonds. So, the cyclohexene would get two iodines, and the vinyl group would as well. Let's think about the structure after both additions.

But wait, the product after adding HI to both double bonds would have iodines at C3 and C4, and at C5 perhaps as CH2-I-CH2-. But wait, how would that affect the structure?

Wait, perhaps after adding HI, the double bonds are gone, so the molecule would have four more hydrogens. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the double bonds. So, breaking the double bonds and adding iodides. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But in this case, the product would have added iodine atoms. So, the formula would change, affecting the index.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the molecule has:

- A cyclohexene ring (so one double bond).

- A formyl group (CHO) at position 2.

- A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5.

So, the cyclohexene has one double bond, the vinyl has another. So, in total, two double bonds.

When treated with HI and red phosphorus, what happens? I think that the reaction is a cleavage of the double bonds, adding iodides in the process.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can cause the addition of HI across the double bonds. So each double bond would add two iodides, turning each double bond into a single bond with two iodides attached.

Wait, but for each addition of HI to a double bond, you add two iodides and two hydrogens. So, for each double bond, you add two iodides and two hydrogens. But wait, the formula for each double bond would change from CnH2m to CnH2m+2I2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about each double bond.

First, the cyclohexene ring. It's a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, C6H10 (since a cyclohexene is C6H10). When HI adds, each double bond would become a single bond with two iodides added.

So, adding HI to the cyclohexene would convert C6H10 to C6H12I2.

Similarly, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-. Adding HI would convert it into CH2I-CH2I. So, the vinyl group (C2H3) would become C2H5I2.

So, the overall molecule after reaction would have all double bonds saturated, with iodides added.

So, the original molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The formula of the original molecule:

Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation (index of hydrogen deficiency) for the original molecule. The formula would be C9H8O3 (wait, wait: let me check.

Wait, the structure is a cyclohexene ring (C6H10), a formyl group (CHO: adds 1 C, 1 O), and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-: adds 2 C, but actually, the vinyl is CH2CH2 with a double bond, so the group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the vinyl adds 2 C and 3 H (since it's CH2CH2, but with a double bond).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count the atoms.

Cyclohexene: 6 C.

Formyl group: CHO is 1 C, 1 O.

Vinyl group: CH2=CH- is 2 C.

Carboxylic acid: COOH is 2 O.

Wait, putting it all together.

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- Cyclohexene: C6H10.

But wait, wait. The formula for the ring: cyclohexene is C6H10.

Adding a formyl group at C2: CHO has 1 C, so now 7 Cs.

Adding a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at C5: adds 2 Cs, so 9 Cs in total.

Carboxylic acid group: -COOH is at which position? The name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the carboxylic acid is at position 1 (assuming numbering starts from the COOH group). Wait, no: in cyclohexene carboxylic acid, the numbering would start so that the carboxylic acid is at position 1. So, the double bond is between C3 and C4, and the substituents are at C2 (formyl) and C5 (vinyl).

So, the structure has:

- 6 C in the ring.

- 1 C from formyl (CHO).

- 2 C from vinyl (CH2=CH-).

- The carboxylic acid group is another COOH (which is 2 O and 2 O, but that's not C). So, total C is 6 + 1 + 2 = 9 C.

Hydrogen count: The cyclohexene ring has 10 H, but with substituents, it'll have less. Each substituent (CHO, CH2=CH-) and the COOH group will take H away.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the degree of unsaturation for the starting molecule.

The formula is C9H8O3. Let me check that. Wait, the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

That's cyclohex-3-ene (C6H10) with substituents at C2 and C5.

Each substituent adds:

- At C2: formyl group (CHO) adds 1 C, 1 O, 1 H (since CHO is CHO–, attached to the ring. So, it's a carbonyl group, which takes a H from the ring.)

- At C5: vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds 2 C, 3 H (since it's CH2CH2, but with a double bond, so the substituent is CH2=CH–, which is a -CH2-CH2- group but with a double bond between the two CH2s. So, the substituent adds 2 C and 3 H (since the double bond is part of the substituent).

Wait, perhaps I should figure out the molecular formula.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- cyclohexene ring: C6H10.

- formyl group (CHO) at position 2: adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H.

- vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at position 5: adds 2 C and 2 H (since the substituent is CH2=CH–, which has how many H? Let's see: the substituent is CH2=CH–, which is a vinyl group. The structure is CH2-CH2 with a double bond, so each CH2 has two H in the substituent. Wait, not sure, but perhaps the substituent adds 3 H? Or maybe the H count is better approached as substituents.

Alternatively, let's count the atoms:

- The ring: 6 C, 10 H.

- COOH group: adds 2 O and 2 H, but wait, in a carboxylic acid, the structure is COOH, which is -COOH. So, that's one O in the carbonyl and two O in the hydroxyl group. Wait, no, it's -COOH, which is one C, two O in the carbonyl and another O in the hydroxyl. So, that adds 2 O.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to build the formula step by step.

The base is cyclohexene: C6H10.

Add the formyl group (CHO): that's adding C, O, and H. The formyl is -CHO, which is one C, one O, and one H. So, adding it would make the formula C7H11O.

Then, the vinyl group: -CH2CH2- but as a substituent, so adding two C and how many H? The vinyl group is CH2=CH–, which as a substituent would be attached at position 5. So, each CH2 has two H, but because of the double bond, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2 with a double bond, so the substituent is CH2=CH–. So, for the substituent, each CH2 has two H, but one is connected to the ring. So, perhaps the substituent adds 3 H (the CH2 has two H, but one is attached to the ring, and the other is in the substituent). Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the molecular formula.

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Each substituent:

- The cyclohexene ring has 6 C, 10 H.

- The formyl group (CHO) adds 1 C, 1 O, 1 H (since it replaces one H on the ring).

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) adds 2 C and 3 H (since the CH2=CH– group has two carbons, each with two H in the substituent, but one H is attached to the ring, so adding 3 H. Alternatively, perhaps it's 4 H? I'm a bit confused here.)

Wait, perhaps I should think of each substituent as a group.

Formyl group (-CHO): adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H (since it's attached to the ring, taking one H from the ring and adding another H from the CHO group? Or maybe it replaces a ring H, so net H remains the same. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula can be determined by considering the parent acid.

The parent is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, which is C6H10O2. Then, the substituents are a formyl and a vinyl.

Formyl adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H (since -CHO is replacing a H on the ring). Similarly, the vinyl adds 2 C and 3 H (because it's -CH2CH2–, but with a double bond, so perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as -CH2CH2–, but with a double bond, so perhaps each CH2 has two H. So, substituent adds 4 H? Or maybe it's better to count the substituent as adding 3 H.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H8O3.

Wait, let me think: cyclohexene is C6H10.

Adding a formyl group (CHO): that's C, H, O. So C becomes 7, H becomes 10-1+1=10 (since one H is replaced by CHO, which has one H in the CHO group), and O becomes 1.

Adding a vinyl group (CH2=CH–): that's adding two C, so C becomes 7+2=9.

Hydrogen: the vinyl group adds 3 H (because the substituent is CH2-CH2, but with a double bond, so each CH2 has two H, but one is attached to the ring. So, perhaps the substituent adds 4 H? Not sure. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the formula for the starting molecule would be C9H8O3.

Wait, degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated by DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X, it's (2*9 +2 -8)/2 = (20-8)/2 = 6. So, the starting molecule has 6 degrees of unsaturation. Let me see: cyclohexene (1 ring and 1 double bond: 2 DoU), formyl group (CHO has a double bond: 1 DoU), vinyl group (another double bond: 1 DoU), and the carboxylic acid (COOH has a double bond: 1 DoU). Wait, that's 2 (from cyclohexene) +1 (CHO) +1 (vinyl) +1 (COOH) =5 DoU. But according to the formula, it's 6. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing one. Or perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the starting molecule has a ring (cyclohexene, which is a ring plus a double bond: two DoU), formyl group (1 DoU, the C=O), vinyl group (1 DoU, the C=C), and the COOH group (1 DoU, the C=O). So, that's 2 +1 +1 +1 =5 DoU. But according to the formula I thought (C9H8O3), the DoU is 6.

Hmm, maybe my formula is incorrect. Let me think again. 

The starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking into parts:

- Cyclohexene ring: C6H10.

- At position 2: formyl group (-CHO): adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H (since it replaces a hydrogen on the ring).

- At position 5: vinyl group (-CH2-CH2– but with a double bond, so it's -CH2=CH–). So, adds 2 C, and perhaps 3 H (since each CH2 has two H, but one is attached to the ring, so the substituent brings 3 H).

- The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is at position 1: adds 2 O and 2 H (since COOH is -COOH, which is O2 and H2).

Wait, but wait, the COOH is part of the ring's substituent. So, the ring is substituted with COOH at position 1, formyl at 2, and vinyl at 5.

So, putting it all together:

Carbon count: 6 (ring) +1 (formyl) +2 (vinyl) +1 (COOH) = 10? No, wait, the COOH is part of the substituent, so perhaps the carbons are 6 (ring) +1 (formyl) +2 (vinyl) =9 C.

Hydrogen count: The ring without substituents is C6H10. Each substituent:

- Formyl (-CHO): replaces one H, adds one H (so H remains same: 10 →10).

- Vinyl (-CH2=CH–): replaces one H, adds 3 H (since the substituent is CH2=CH–, which has two CH2 groups but a double bond. So, how many H does it add? Let's think: the substituent is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So, the ring position 5 has a CH2=CH– group. Each CH2 in the substituent has two H. The substituent is CH2–CH2, but with a double bond, so perhaps the structure is CH2=CH–, which is CH2–CH2 as a substituent but with a double bond. So, the substituent brings two CH2 groups, each with two H, but the double bond reduces the number of H.

Wait, maybe it's better to count all H in the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H8O3.

So, DoU = (2*9 +2 -8 -0)/2 = (20-8)/2=6.

So, 6 DoU.

But in the structure, I thought we have:

- Cyclohexene (1 ring and 1 double bond: 2 DoU).

- Formyl (1 DoU).

- Vinyl (1 DoU).

- COOH (1 DoU).

That's 5 DoU. Hmm, but formula suggests 6. So perhaps I'm missing another DoU. Ah, wait, the cyclohexene is a ring plus a double bond, which is two DoU each? No, a ring and a double bond are each one DoU. So, cyclohexene has a ring (1) and a double bond (another 1), so 2 DoU.

Formyl: C=O (1 DoU).

Vinyl: C=C (1 DoU).

COOH: C=O (1 DoU).

That's 2 +1 +1 +1 =5. Hmm, but formula gives 6.

Ah! Wait, the COOH group is a carboxylic acid, which is a carbonyl (DoU 1) and an -OH group, which doesn't add DoU. So, that's correct. Maybe I'm missing another DoU. Did I forget about the ring's double bond? Wait, the structure is cyclohex-3-ene, so the ring has a double bond (DoU 1) and the ring itself (DoU 1). So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula I have is incorrect. Let's calculate the formula again.

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The parent acid is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid: C6H10O2.

Adding a formyl group (CHO): adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H. So, formula becomes C7H11O3.

Adding a vinyl group (CH2=CH–): adds 2 C and 3 H. So, C9 H14 O3. Wait, that can't be. Because the parent is C6H10O2. Adding formyl: C7H11O3. Adding vinyl (CH2=CH–): adds 2 C (C9) and 3 H (H14). But then, with the double bond in the vinyl, perhaps H is less. Hmm, maybe I'm not accounting correctly for the double bond in the vinyl group.

Wait, the vinyl group is a substituent with a double bond, so it would have two less H than an ethyl group. Wait, an ethyl group has 5 H (CH2CH3), but a vinyl group (CH2=CH–) has 4 H (CH2=CH–, each CH2 has 2 H, but because of the double bond, the substituent has 4 H? Or 3 H? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH–, which has three H (the CH2 has two H, the CH has one H). So, perhaps the substituent adds 3 H.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C9H8O3. So, let's go with that.

When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens?

I think the reaction adds HI across each double bond, converting each double bond into a single bond with iodide substituents. So, each double bond would be converted into a single bond with two iodides added.

So, for each double bond, the H and I are added.

So, the product would have all the double bonds saturated, and the iodides added.

So, the product would have:

- The cyclohexane ring (no double bond).

- The formyl group remains (CHO).

- The vinyl group becomes CH2I-CH2I.

Wait, but the vinyl group's double bond would be converted into a single bond with two iodides. So, CH2=CH– becomes CH2I-CH2I?

No, wait. When HI adds to a double bond, it adds across it, leading to a vicinal diiodide. So, CH2=CH– would become CH2I-CH2I.

Wait, but each addition of HI to a double bond would add two iodides and two hydrogens. So, each double bond is converted into a single bond with two iodide groups.

In the product, the molecule would have:

- The cyclohexane ring (no double bond, so 6 C, 12 H).

- The formyl group (CHO: 1 C, 1 H, 1 O).

- The vinyl group (now CH2I-CH2I: 2 C, 4 H, 2 I).

- The carboxylic acid group (COOH: 2 O).

So, the formula would change to: C9 H14 O3 I2.

Wait, but let me calculate the DoU for this product.

Formula: C9H14O3I2.

DoU = (2*9 +2 -14 - 2*1 +0)/2 = (20-14-2)/2= (4)/2=2.

Wait, that can't be right because the starting material had 6 DoU and we saturated two double bonds. So, each double bond was one DoU, so 2 DoU removed. So, 6-2=4 DoU? But according to the formula I just calculated, it's 2.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recalculate.

Original product formula: C9H14O3I2.

DoU = (2*9 +2 -14 -2)/2 → (20-14-2)=4 → 4/2=2.

But the starting material had 6 DoU. Each double bond (two of them) contributes 2 DoU. So, after reaction, each double bond is gone, so the product has 6-2=4 DoU.

So, why is the calculated DoU 2? That suggests that my formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the formula.

The product after adding HI to both double bonds:

- The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane (C6H12).

- The formyl group (CHO) remains (C1H1O).

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) becomes CH2I-CH2I (C2H4I2).

- The COOH group remains (C1H2O2).

So, adding up:

Carbon: 6 +1 +2 +1 =10? Wait, no. The original molecule was C9. Adding two iodides doesn't add any C, so the product would still have C9.

Wait, perhaps I'm making an error here. The starting molecule is C9, and the product would have C9 plus 2 I, but no additional C.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C9H14O3I2.

So, DoU = (2*9 +2 -14 -2*1)/2 → (20-14-2)=4 → 4/2=2.

But according to the initial structure, the product should have 4 DoU. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product's structure in terms of rings and double bonds.

After the reaction, the product has a cyclohexane ring (no double bond, so 1 ring → 1 DoU), and any other double bonds.

Wait, the formyl group (CHO) still has a double bond (C=O), which is 1 DoU. The COOH group also has a double bond (C=O), another DoU. The vinyl group's double bond is gone, replaced by a single bond with two iodides.

So, the product would have:

- 1 ring (DoU 1).

- 2 carbonyl groups (each DoU 1).

Total DoU: 1 +2 =3.

Ah, so the DoU should be 3.

But according to the formula, it's 2. So, something's wrong with the calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recount the H.

The product after reaction:

Cyclohexane: C6H12.

Formyl group: CHO → C1H1O.

Vinyl group converted to CH2I-CH2I → which is C2H4I2.

COOH group: COOH → C1H2O2.

So, adding up:

Carbon: 6 +1 +2 +1 =10 C? No, wait, the starting molecule is C9. So, perhaps I'm adding incorrectly.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, which has 9 C. After reaction, the product would have:

- 6 C from cyclohexane.

- 1 C from formyl (CHO).

- 2 C from the vinyl group (now CH2I-CH2I).

- 1 C from COOH (but COOH is part of the ring, so perhaps it's already counted in the 6 C of cyclohexane). Wait, no. The COOH is on the cyclohexane ring, so it's part of the 6 C.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Cyclohexane: C6H12.

COOH: -COOH is part of the ring, so it's already included.

The substituents are:

- CHO (1 C) → C7.

- CH2I-CH2I (2 C) → C9.

So, the product has 9 C.

Now, H count:

Cyclohexane: 12 H.

CHO: 1 H.

CH2I-CH2I: 4 H.

COOH: does it contribute any H? The COOH group is -COOH, which has two H (the hydroxyl group). Or wait, in the product, the COOH is still present. So, the COOH group has 2 H.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's try to count all H in the product.

Each part:

- Cyclohexane (C6H12): 12 H.

- CHO (–CHO): 1 H (the H in the CHO group).

- CH2I-CH2I (–CH2I-CH2I): 4 H.

- COOH (–COOH): 2 H (the –OH group).

Wait, but in the product, the COOH group would be –COOH, which has two H: one from the carbonyl and one from the hydroxyl? Wait, no. The COOH group is -COOH, which has two oxygen atoms: the carbonyl (O double bond) and the hydroxyl (O with H). So, the H count for COOH is 2 H: one from the hydroxyl and one from the adjacent carbon? Or perhaps I'm mixing up.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is -COOH, which is part of the ring. So, when the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, the COOH remains as –COOH, which has two H: one in the –OH group and one in the adjacent carbon (since it's a carboxylic acid, the H is on the O).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the product's formula as C9H14O3I2.

In that case, the DoU would be (2*9 +2 -14 -2*1)/2 → (20-14-2)=4 → 4/2=2.

But according to the structure, the product should have a ring (DoU 1) and two carbonyl groups (each DoU 1), so total 3 DoU.

This discrepancy suggests that my formula might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Let me think again about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the cleavage of alkynes to produce ketones or other products. Alternatively, in the presence of alkenes, perhaps they add HI.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the addition of HI across the double bonds, but with possible elimination of iodide in a way that forms rings or other structures. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reaction is the addition of HI to each double bond, leading to a diiodide for each. So, in the product, each double bond is replaced by two iodides.

So, the product would have:

- The cyclohexane ring (saturated, no DoU from the ring).

- The formyl group (still has C=O, DoU 1).

- The COOH group (still has C=O, DoU 1).

- The vinyl group (now a single bond with two iodides, so no DoU).

Wait, but the cyclohexane ring is a single ring (no double bonds), so that's 1 DoU (from the ring). Wait, no, a ring is a single DoU regardless of whether it's a cyclohexane or cyclohexene. So, if the ring is saturated, it's a cyclohexane with a single ring, which is one DoU.

But in the starting molecule, the ring had a double bond (cyclohexene), which contributed two DoU: one from the ring and one from the double bond. After the reaction, the ring is cyclohexane, so only one DoU from the ring.

So, the product's DoU would be:

- 1 (ring) + 1 (CHO) +1 (COOH) =3 DoU.

Which matches the earlier thought that the product has DoU of 3.

But according to the formula C9H14O3I2, the calculated DoU is 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recount the H in the product.

The product would be:

Cyclohexane: C6H12.

CHO: C1H1O.

CH2I-CH2I: C2H4I2.

COOH: C1H2O2.

Wait, but that's adding up to C10, which can't be right because the starting material is C9. So, perhaps I'm double-counting some carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is part of the cyclohexane ring, so the formula is:

Cyclohexane (6 C) with substituents:

- CHO (1 C) at position 2.

- CH2I-CH2I (2 C) at position 5.

- COOH (1 C) at position 1.

Wait, but that would make 6 +1 +2 +1 =10 C, which is more than the starting material.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think: the COOH is part of the cyclohexane ring, so it's a substituent on the ring. So, the ring is C6, and the substituents are:

- At position 1: COOH (adds 1 C).

- At position 2: CHO (adds 1 C).

- At position 5: CH2I-CH2I (adds 2 C).

So, total C:6 +1 +1 +2=10. But the starting material is C9, so something's wrong.

Ah! Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the COOH is part of the ring, meaning the substituents are:

- CHO at C2.

- vinyl at C5.

So, the ring is C6, and the substituents add 1 (CHO) +2 (vinyl) +0 (COOH is part of the ring) =3 C. So, total C:6+3=9. So, the product after reaction would have:

Cyclohexane (6 C).

CHO (1 C).

CH2I-CH2I (2 C).

COOH is part of the ring, which is already counted in the 6 C.

So, total C:6+1+2=9.

That makes sense.

Now, H count:

Cyclohexane: C6H12 →12 H.

CHO:–CHO has 1 H.

CH2I-CH2I: each CH2 has 2 H, but since it's a substituent, perhaps it's CH2I–CH2I. So, each CH2 group has 2 H, but the two I are attached. So, 4 H in the substituent.

COOH: –COOH has 2 H (the hydroxyl H and the adjacent H from the ring? Or perhaps just the OH H. Wait, in the COOH group, the structure is –COOH, which has OOH, so one H.

Wait, perhaps the COOH group contributes one H (the –OH group).

So, total H:

12 (cyclohexane) +1 (CHO) +4 (CH2I-CH2I) +1 (COOH) =18 H.

Plus any H from the iodides? No, iodine doesn't affect H count in this context.

So, the formula would be C9H18O3I2.

Wait, but that can't be right because the starting material was C9H8O3, and we're adding H and I. Let me check the DoU for this formula.

DoU = (2*9 +2 -18 -2*1)/2 → (20-18-2)=0 → 0/2=0.

That can't be right. So, perhaps my H count is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a different structure. Maybe the reaction doesn't just add HI across the double bonds but also affects the substituents in another way.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is causing the cleavage of the double bonds. Let me think again about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the cleavage of nitriles, but without nitriles, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the addition of HI to the double bonds, leading to the formation of a diiodide. So, each double bond adds two iodides and two hydrogens.

So, the product would have:

- The cyclohexane ring (saturated).

- The formyl group (CHO remains).

- The vinyl group becomes CH2I-CH2I.

- The COOH group remains.

So, the product formula would be C9H14O3I2.

DoU is (2*9 +2 -14 -2)/2 → (20-14-2)=4 →4/2=2.

But according to the structure, it should have 3 DoU (ring, CHO, COOH).

Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not adding HI to both double bonds but only to one.

Wait, but the product after reaction would have both double bonds converted into single bonds, so the DoU would decrease by 2.

Original DoU:6.

After reaction: 6-2=4.

But according to the formula, it's 2. So, I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the product has a different structure. Let me think about the product again.

After the reaction, the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane (no DoU from double bond, but ring remains, so 1 DoU).

The formyl group remains (CHO, 1 DoU).

The vinyl group becomes CH2I-CH2I (no DoU).

The COOH group remains (COOH, 1 DoU).

So, total DoU: 1 (ring) +1 (CHO) +1 (COOH) =3 DoU.

So, the product should have 3 DoU.

Thus, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.


To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, we analyze the reaction and the structure of the product.

### Step 1: Analyze the starting material
The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following features:
- A cyclohexene ring (C6H10) with a double bond (1 DoU from the double bond and 1 DoU from the ring).
- A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2 (1 DoU from the C=O bond).
- A vinyl group (-CH2=CH–) at position 5 (1 DoU from the C=C bond).
- A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 (1 DoU from the C=O bond).

Thus, the starting material has **6 degrees of unsaturation**.

### Step 2: Reaction with red phosphorus and HI
The reaction involves the addition of HI across the double bonds in the molecule. Specifically:
- The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated, converting it into a cyclohexane ring.
- The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH2=CH–) is also saturated, converting it into a single bond with iodine atoms attached.

After the reaction, the product will have:
- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond, but retains 1 DoU from the ring).
- A formyl group (-CHO) (retains 1 DoU from the C=O bond).
- A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) (retains 1 DoU from the C=O bond).
- A saturated vinyl group (-CH2I-CH2I) (no DoU).

### Step 3: Calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product
The product has:
- 1 DoU from the cyclohexane ring.
- 1 DoU from the formyl group (-CHO).
- 1 DoU from the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

Thus, the product has **3 degrees of unsaturation**.

### Final Answer
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **3**.
