Okay, so I've got this problem about quantum mechanics, right? Hmm, it's about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific value. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh, wait, that's a vector. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state is usually a vector, and observables are represented by matrices. So the observable here is matrix P. The question is about the probability of measuring P and getting 0. 

I think the general approach is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P. Because when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the absolute value of the component of the state vector in the corresponding eigenvector's direction.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P's rows are:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, let me write it properly:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

The determinant of (P - λ I) is the determinant of:

-λ   1/√2    0
1/√2  -λ    1/√2
0    1/√2   -λ

Calculating this determinant... Hmm, let's see. Maybe there's a pattern here. The matrix seems symmetric, so the eigenvectors are orthogonal, which might help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let me think. The matrix P looks like it's a symmetric matrix, so real eigenvalues. Also, I notice that the matrix has a sort of symmetric structure. Maybe it's a tridiagonal matrix with zeros on the diagonal except for the middle element.

Wait, no, the diagonal elements are all 0 except for the middle one?
