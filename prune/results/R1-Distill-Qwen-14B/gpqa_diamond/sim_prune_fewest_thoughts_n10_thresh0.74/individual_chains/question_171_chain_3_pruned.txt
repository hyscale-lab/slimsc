Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that bromine under certain conditions can act as an electrophile in such reactions. The question is about the para-isomer yield for six different substituted benzene rings. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. 

Wait, the problem states that each undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each will form a bromine-substituted benzene ring, but the position (para, meta, etc.) depends on the substituents.

First, I should recall the directing effects of substituents. Electrophilic substitution is influenced by activating and deactivating groups. Activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2) are ortho/para directors, making substitution more likely in those positions. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -Cl) are meta directors because they make the ring less reactive and direct incoming groups to the meta position.

Wait, but what about the substituents given here?

Let's list them:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. So when bromine attacks, the major product would be para and ortho. But wait, bromine is a strong electrophile and in such reactions, like bromination with FeBr3, which is a Lewis acid catalyst. Toluene (methyl) being an activating group, the ring is more reactive. So for toluene, bromination would give mainly para and ortho. But wait, I thought that for toluene, the para isomer is more favored because of steric hindrance in the ortho position? Or is that not the case here?

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's ethyl benzoate. The substituent is COOEt (ester group). Ester groups are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So they are meta directors. So the bromine would add mostly meta.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. Cl is a deactivating group (due to electronegativity) but it's ortho/para directing because it's a lone pair (though weakly activating in some cases, like in nucleophilic substitution but in electrophilic, it's deactivating and ortho/para). Wait no, I might be mixing things up. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group by inductive effect but has a lone pair that can donate electrons through resonance, making it an ortho/para director. So in electrophilic substitution, Cl directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions, but since it's deactivating, the ring is less reactive. So for chlorobenzene, the major products would be para and ortho, but the para is more favored due to less steric hindrance than ortho.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.
