Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out.

The question says that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, so let's break this down. Both compounds are tetramethylbenzenes, I think, because the options are all that. Or wait, one of the options is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Oh right, that has ethyl groups instead of methyls. But let's see.

First, the aromatic region: two singlets around 6.7 ppm. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes equally. Each singlet implies that the protons in each are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons. So each compound must have a set of equivalent aromatic protons.

Wait, but each of the compounds is a tetramethylbenzene, right? So let's think about the structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Option C: 1,2,3,5 and 1,4-diethyl.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

So, each compound is either a tetramethylbenzene or diethyl. Let's see how their NMR would look.

In aromatic regions, the number of unique protons depends on the substitution pattern. For example, a para-substituted benzene would have two equivalent protons, but in a more substituted case, maybe more equivalence.

Wait, but for a benzene ring with four substituents, like tetramethylbenzene, the substitution pattern affects the splitting.

Let me think about each compound:

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: That's a benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the ring looks like a 1,2,3,4-tetra. Let me visualize that. Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 are methyl, 5 and 6 are H. Wait, no, actually, wait: 1,2,3,4 are all adjacent positions. So the structure would have four methyl groups in a row. Wait, but that's not possible because benzene is a ring. Wait, positions 1, 2, 3, 4 would be in a row? Actually, no, because the numbering would go around the ring. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl structure, which would have two methyl groups opposite each other and the other two adjacent. Hmm, maybe I should
