Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. Anyway, the problem gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The albedo for all three is 0.3, similar to Earth's. I need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

Hmm, so the given data are:

- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2: ~1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4.
- Temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3: ~2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3.
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2: ~1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15.
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3: ~1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35.
- Albedo for all is 0.3.

We need to find Period3 / Period1.

Wait, but how do these ratios relate to each other? I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its orbital period. Oh wait, no, the period is related through Kepler's third law, which connects the period with the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. But the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula: T = [(L*(1 - a))/(16πσ D^2)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the distance (semi-major axis). So T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4). But since all three planets are around the same star, L is the same for all.

So for each planet, T is proportional to (1/D)^(1/2). So T ~ 1/sqrt(D). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures squared is inversely proportional to the ratio of distances.

Wait, let me think again. T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) * (L/(16πσ))^(1/4). Wait,
