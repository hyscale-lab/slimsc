Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, let's see. I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. The question is asking how many of the listed stars have a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

First, I need to figure out what determines if a star is detectable by ESPRESSO. I think the key factors are the star's brightness, distance, and perhaps its spectral type. But wait, the question gives absolute magnitudes and distances, so I should probably calculate their apparent magnitudes to see how bright they appear from Earth.

Absolute magnitude (M) is the brightness a star would have at 10 parsecs. The formula to calculate apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. Oh wait, no, the correct formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) which simplifies to m = M + 5(log10 d - 1) = M + 5 log10 d -5.

So for each star, I can compute m and then figure out how bright it is. Because a lower apparent magnitude means a brighter star. But wait, what's the threshold for the S/N ratio of 10?

I remember that the S/N ratio in spectroscopy depends on the star's flux (brightness) and the exposure time. The formula I think is S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) / noise, but I might be getting some factors wrong. Or maybe the noise is related to photon noise, which is sqrt(flux). So S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux multiplied by the exposure time.

Wait, another approach: the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity. I should look up what's the typical S/N it can achieve for a given star. Oh right, but I can't access external links, so I have to think from what I remember.

ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high-resolution spectroscopy, and it's used for things like detecting exoplanets via the radial velocity method. It needs a certain S/N per pixel to do that. But in this question, the S/N per binned pixel has to be at least 10 after one hour.

So the brightness of the star is crucial. Brighter stars (lower m) will give higher S/N. There's a formula that relates the signal-to-noise ratio to the star's magnitude. I think the formula for S/N is something like S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is some reference magnitude and t is the exposure time in seconds. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember that for a given instrument, the S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux from the star. Flux is inversely proportional to the square of the distance and depends on the star's luminosity (which is tied to its absolute magnitude).

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this by comparing each star's apparent magnitude and seeing if it's bright enough for ESPRESSO to get S/N >=10 in 1 hour.

I should find the threshold apparent magnitude where S/N is 10. Suppose the formula is S/N = k * 10^(-0.4*(m - m_ref)) * sqrt(t), where k is a constant depending on the instrument. But without exact numbers, I might need to find another way.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that a star's flux (F) is proportional to 10^(-0.4*m). So F = F0 * 10^(-0.4*m), where F0 is the flux for m=0.

The S/N is proportional to F * sqrt(t), because noise (like photon noise) scales with sqrt(F), and the signal scales with F. So S/N ∝ F * sqrt(t).

Wait, think again: S/N is (signal)/(noise). The signal is proportional to F * t, and the noise (like photon noise) is sqrt(F * t). So S/N = (F * t) / sqrt(F * t) ) = sqrt(F * t). So S/N ∝ sqrt(F * t).

Since F is proportional to 10^(-0.4*m), then S/N ∝ sqrt( 10^(-0.4*m) * t )

Given t is 1 hour = 3600 seconds. Let's define a constant C such that S/N = C * sqrt(10^(-0.4*m) * t), but I need to find the C that makes S/N =10 when m is some value.

Wait, perhaps I can find the formula from the ESPRESSO documentation. I remember that ESPRESSO's sensitivity is
