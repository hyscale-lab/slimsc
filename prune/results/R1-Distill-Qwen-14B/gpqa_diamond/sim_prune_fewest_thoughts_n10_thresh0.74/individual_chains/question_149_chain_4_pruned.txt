Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, that suggests that the two peaks are from two different environments of the same proton. But why would that happen?

They also ruled out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Spin-spin coupling usually causes multiple peaks for adjacent protons, but this is the same alpha-proton. Oh wait, maybe it's not coupling but something else. Could it be diastereomers or enantiomers?

Looking at the LC-MS part, the crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. Wait, same mass? So, it's not a fragment or a different molecule. Same mass but different peaksâ€”could they be enantiomers or diastereomers?

In LC-MS, if the peaks are the same mass but different in the chromatogram, that suggests isomers. Enantiomers would have the same mass but could have different retention times if the column is chiral. But in normal LC columns, enantiomers may not separate. Oh wait, the question says it's at elevated temperature. Hmm, but sometimes higher temps can cause more separation because of different interactions, maybe.

Wait, let me think about what the options say.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. That would mean another compound with a lower mass, perhaps. But the MS shows same mass, so probably not. Unless the precursor has same mass, but that's unlikely.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have same molecular weight, so MS would show same mass. But in NMR, enantiomers are identical because they're mirror images, so you wouldn't see splitting for the same proton. Unless the compound is a racemic mixture, but then the NMR would look the same as a single enantiomer because enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. So the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks for the same proton in that case. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, I'm not
