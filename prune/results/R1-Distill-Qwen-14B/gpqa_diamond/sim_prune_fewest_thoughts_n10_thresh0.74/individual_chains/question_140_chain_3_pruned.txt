Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me go through it step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, let's think about gas W. Its molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is probably something like CO2, H2O, or maybe something else. Wait, no, same number of neutrons and protons in the molecule? Wait, maybe each atom in the molecule has protons and neutrons equal. Or maybe the molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons summed. Hmm, I think it's each molecule. Oh wait, wait, the molecule's total protons equal total neutrons. Or each atom in the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Hmm, the wording says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons.

Possible gases that release when something reacts. Common gases are CO2, H2O (vapor), NH3, maybe O2, N2? Let's think about their protons and neutrons.

Let me think: For H2O, each molecule has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron) and O (8 protons and 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 2*(0) + 8 = 8. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons. Not equal.

What about CO2? Each molecule has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. Oh! Because the molecule as a whole has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that
