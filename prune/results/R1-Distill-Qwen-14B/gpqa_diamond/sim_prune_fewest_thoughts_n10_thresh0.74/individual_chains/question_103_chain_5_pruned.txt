Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a series of steps.

Let me start by drawing the target molecule. The structure is a benzene ring with substituents. The substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions. At position 3, there's a bromo group, and at position 5, a nitro group. Then, attached to the benzene is an ethan-1-one groupâ€”so that's a ketone group (C=O) attached to a methyl group, making it a propanone, but wait, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO? No, wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-, so the ketone is at the end. So the benzene has a substituent that's a ketone with a CH2- group attached? Wait, no. Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would be where the benzene is attached to a C=O group via a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait: Ethan-1-one is CH3CO-, right? So the structure is benzene with a substituent that is a CH2-C(=O)-, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the ketone is at position 1. Hmm. Wait, perhaps it's benzene with a substituent that's a ketone attached directly. No, wait, the formula is 1-(...phenyl)ethan-1-one. So ethan-1-one is (CH2)1-C(=O)-. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is C(=O)CH2-... No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the IUPAC name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but that's propan-2-one. Wait, no, wait: ethan-1-one would imply a
