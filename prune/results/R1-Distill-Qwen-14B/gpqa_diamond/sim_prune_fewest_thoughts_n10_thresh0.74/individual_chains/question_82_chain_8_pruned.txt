Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these synthesis questions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

So the question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclooctatetraene and going through several steps to form a final product. The options are four different structures, and I need to figure out which one is the major isomer of product 3.

First, let's break down the reactions.

The first step: Cyclooctatetraene is heated with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio to form product 1. I remember that cyclooctatetraene is a non-aromatic, tub-shaped molecule. When it reacts with a dienophile like maleic anhydride, it probably undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, cyclooctatetraene isn't a diene, it's more of a conjugated system. Oh wait, maybe it can act as a diene in some cases. Alternatively, maybe it's undergoing some [4+2] cycloaddition. Hmm, or perhaps it's opening up to form a diradical or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder where the maleic anhydride is the dienophile and the cyclooctatetraene is the diene? Or wait, cyclooctatetraene is a conjugated eight-membered ring with alternating double bonds. It can undergo electrocyclic ring-opening under heat to form an open-chain diene, which can then react in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, I think when cyclooctatetraene is heated, it undergoes electrocyclic ring-opening to form 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene, which would open into 1,3,5,7-octadienedial or something like that. Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the ring might open to form a conjugated diene. I remember that upon heating, cyclooctatetraene can open to form a 1,3,5,7
