Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and qubit states. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question gives a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are points in 3D space.

Wait, I remember that a qubit is a two-level system, so its state can be represented as a vector in a 2D space, right? But density matrices are 2x2 matrices, and I think they form a three-dimensional space. Oh, right! The density matrices for a qubit are 3-dimensional because they're 2x2 Hermitian matrices with trace 1. So each density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3D space, often called the Bloch sphere when it's a pure state.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out. The standard basis states |0> and |1> are [1;0] and [0;1] respectively. So |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in (2,2). Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with [1;0;0;1], but then multiplied by 1/2, so each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

I remember that any density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. Since our ρ has both diagonal elements as 1/2 and the off-diagonal as 0, let's see what r would be.

The identity matrix I for 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices σ are [[0,1],[1,0]] (σx), [[0,-i],[i,0]] (σy), and [[1,0],[0,-1]] (σz). So let's plug into the general form:

ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz ) / 2.

Expanding this, let's compute each term. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so r_x σx will have elements (0, r_x), (r_x, 0). Similarly σy has elements with i and -i. But in our case, the off-diagonal terms in ρ are zero. Let me compute each term.

Wait, let's substitute:

rho = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz ) / 2.

So each term:

I gives [[1,0],[0,1]].

r_x σx is [[0, r_x],[r_x, 0]].

r_y σy is [[0, -i r_y],[i r_y, 0]].

r_z σz is [[r_z, 0],[0, -r_z]].

Adding all these together and multiplying by 1/2, the resulting matrix should equal ρ, which is [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]].

Let me write out each element.

Top-left element: (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2.

So (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z =0.

Top-right element: (r_x -i r_y)/2. But in rho, this is 0. So (r_x -i r_y)/2 =0 → numerator must be zero → r_x - i r_y =0.

Similarly, the bottom-left element is the same as top-right because rho is diagonal; in our case, it's 0. So same condition.

Finally, the bottom-right element: (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2. As before, (1 -0)/2=1/2, which is correct.

So from r_z =0, and r_x - i r_y=0. Hmm, but r is a real vector, right? Because the density matrix has to be Hermitian. So the components r_x, r_y, r_z are real numbers.

Wait, because r is a real vector, so the terms from r_x σx and r_y σy must combine such that their non-diagonal terms are real. Wait, but σy introduces imaginary terms. Wait, that's confusing. Because in the expression (I + r·σ)/2, r is a real vector, so when you compute the off-diagonal terms, the imaginary parts must cancel out.

Wait, maybe I should reconsider.

The top-right element of ρ is (r_x -i r_y)/2, which is equal to zero. So (r_x -i r_y) must be zero because the denominator is 2 and the top-right element is zero.

But since r_x and r_y are real numbers, the only way this can be zero is if r_x =0 and r_y=0. Because  r_x is real, and r_y is real. So, r_x =0 and r_y=0.

Wait, let me check that. Let's suppose r_x and r_y are real. So (r_x - i r_y) must be zero. Expanding, the real part is r_x, and the imaginary part is (- r_y). So both must be zero. So r_x=0, r_y=0.

So that leaves r_z. We found earlier that r_z=0.

So the vector r is (0, 0, 0). So the point is at the origin.

Wait, but the density matrix is (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. Its representation in the Bloch sphere is the origin because it's completely mixed, no direction in any axis. So that makes sense.

Looking at the options: option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with entries \(\frac{1}{2}\) on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, so it corresponds to a maximally mixed state. Density matrices for qubits are represented as points in a 3D space, where each density matrix can be expressed in the form 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

with \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) being a real vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) representing the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms are equal. This implies that the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must satisfy:

1. \(r_z = 0\) (from the diagonal elements),
2. \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\) (from the off-diagonal elements).

Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the 3D space of qubit density matrices. This result aligns with the fact that the maximally mixed state has no preference for any direction in the Bloch sphere.

The correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is therefore:
