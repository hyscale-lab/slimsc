Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. Oh right, because the Sun's radius is about 700,000 km, and light travels about 300,000 km/s, so 700,000 /3e5 is roughly 2.3 minutes? Wait, no, wait: 700,000 km is about 4.67e8 meters. Light travels that in (4.67e8)/(3e8) seconds, which is about 1.55 seconds. Wait, noâ€”wait, wait, no, no. The Sun's radius is about 7e5 km. Oh wait, no, the radius of the Sun is about 696,340 km. So 696,340,000 meters. Oh, wait, wait, that's 6.96e8 meters. So time is distance over speed: 6.96e8 m / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 2.32 seconds. Hmm, but the question says 8.5 minutes ago. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Oh, wait, the neutrinos from the Sun's core take about 8 minutes to reach Earth because they're produced in the core and have to travel through the Sun's layers. So if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that would mean that the neutrinos from that process would have just barely reached Earth now. So any changes in the production would affect the flux we observe now.

The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: band 1 is 700-800 keV, band 2 is 800-900 keV. So, what's the flux from each?

I remember that the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core. The pp-I and pp-II branches are lower in the chain, and pp-III is a higher-energy part. So if pp-III stops, that would affect the production of certain neutrinos.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun primarily via the proton-proton chain. The main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the beta decay steps. The pp-III branch is one of the steps in the
