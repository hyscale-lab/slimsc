Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and jot down the important details.

The problem: We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 200 mL, right?) that contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. At 25°C. They're asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO₄³⁻. The molecular weights (Mw) are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The Ka values for H₃PO₄ are also provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is PO₄³⁻, which is the conjugate base from HPO₄²⁻. Since the problem gives us both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, I think these are going to form a buffer solution. Buffer solutions use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, right?

Wait, let me think: KH₂PO₄ is H₂PO₄⁻ when dissolved, and Na₂HPO₄ dissociates into 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻. So in solution, we have H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. These two are adjacent species in the phosphate ion's dissociation series.

So, the relevant Ka here is Ka2, because H₂PO₄⁻ can lose a proton to become HPO₄²⁻. And the equation for that is H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ HPO₄²⁻ + H⁺. The Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which I'll probably need.

Now, the buffer equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, in this case, the acid is H₂PO₄⁻ and the base is HPO₄²⁻. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation will be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO₄²⁻]/[H₂PO₄⁻]).

But wait, I don't have the pH given. Oh right, but maybe I can find the pH from the solution. Alternatively, perhaps I can find [PO₄³⁻] directly through another approach. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Wait, orthophosphate is PO₄³⁻, which would come from HPO₄²⁻ losing another proton. But given that we're at a pH around the second dissociation, maybe the concentration of PO₄³⁻ is going to be small. Alternatively, maybe the solution is such that PO₄³⁻ is negligible unless we consider all the dissociations.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the distribution of phosphate species in solution. Since we're adding both H₂PO
