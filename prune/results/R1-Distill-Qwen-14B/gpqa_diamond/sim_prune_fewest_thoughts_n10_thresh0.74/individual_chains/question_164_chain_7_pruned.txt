Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? The question gives me some data about two systems, system_1 and system_2. I need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. Both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. So the orbital period for system_1 is P1 = 2 years, and for system_2, P2 = 1 year.

Spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The mass of a system is the sum of the masses of the two stars.

Wait, how do I relate radial velocity amplitudes to the masses of the stars? Oh right, in binary systems, each star orbits the center of mass. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit (and hence smaller velocity), while the less massive one would have a larger orbit (and higher velocity). So the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses.

Let me think: if star A has mass M_A and velocity K_A, and star B has mass M_B and velocity K_B, then M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, since they have to share the same orbital motion around the center of mass. So their masses are inversely proportional to their velocities.

So for each system, I can find the mass function. Wait, but the mass function involves the inclination angle, but since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume that their orbital planes are edge-on, so the inclination i is 90 degrees. Which means that the true mass can be determined from the observed velocities.

Wait, but how do we calculate the mass of the entire system from this? Let me recall the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. The formula is K = [ (2π G) / (P (1-e²)^0.5 ) ]^(1/3) * [ (M_companion) sin i ] / ( (M_total)^(2/3) ) )

But since the eccentricity e isn't given, I think we can assume it's zero or that (1-e²)^0.5 is 1. So simplifying, K is proportional to (M_companion) / (M_total)^(2/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3).

Wait, but for each star in the binary system, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the other star. Let me think, for each star, the mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2π G) )^(1/3), but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember that for a binary system, the sum of the velocities is such that K1 + K2 = (v1 + v2), but wait, no, in reality, each star has its own velocity. Their velocities are related by their masses. So M1 K1 = M2 K2. Because the center of mass is stationary, so M1 r1 = M2 r2, and since velocity is distance over time (period), v1 = 2π r1 / P, v2 = 2π r2 / P. So M1 v1 = M2 v2 => M1 K1 = M2 K2, since K1 = v1 and K2 = v2.

So, for system_1, K1 =10 km/s, K2=5 km/s. So M1 / M2 = K2
