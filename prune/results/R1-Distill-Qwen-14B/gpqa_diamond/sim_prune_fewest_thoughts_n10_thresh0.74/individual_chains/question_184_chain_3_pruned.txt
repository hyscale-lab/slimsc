Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to determine which sequence leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I'll draw the structure to visualize it. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, actually, numbering might be off. Let me think: if it's 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the ring has three substituents in a row, 1, 2, 3 positions.

Synthesis steps typically involve electrophilic substitution. The order of adding substituents matters because each new group directs the next reaction. Benzene is the starting material.

Let me list the substituents and their directing effects:

- tert-butyl (t-Bu): It's a bulky, activating group. As a strong activating group, it's an ortho/para director. But wait, t-butyl is a bulky group, so in electrophilic substitution, it's more likely to direct incoming groups to the less hindered positions, which would be the para and meta positions relative to itself, but wait, wait.

Wait, substituents can be ortho, meta, or para directors. tert-Butyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl chain. So it's an activating, ortho/para director. But because it's bulky, when adding substituents, the next group may prefer to go in the para position due to steric hindrance. Hmm, but maybe I shouldn't get too bogged down on that and just think about the order of reactions.

The substituents are t-Bu, ethoxy, and nitro. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Ethoxy is activating (since O-R is activating), but the oxygen is more electronegative, so ethoxy is a strong activating, ortho/para director.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. So if I have a nitro group on the ring, any new substituents would go meta to it? Or wait, nitro is a meta director for itself. No, wait, it's a meta director for incoming electrophiles. So when a nitro group is present, the incoming substituent will add at the meta position relative to the nitro.

Wait, but the product has three substituents. Let me think about the order in which they are added.

Let me outline the possible steps:

1. Add the tert-butyl group first. Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. So that's step one.

2. Next, add the ethoxy group. But wait, after adding t-Bu, which is an activating group, the next substitution would be directed by it. So the ethoxy group could go in the ortho or para position relative to t-Bu.

But where is it in the target molecule? The target has the ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. So positions 1, 2, 3. So the ethoxy is at position 1, which is adjacent to the t-Bu at position 2. Hmm, so that's ortho to t-Bu.

Alternatively, perhaps another substituent comes first.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Let's think about that.

If I nitrate benzene first, the nitro group will be added as the first substituent. Then, in the next step, adding another group. Nitro is meta director, so the next group would add meta to nitro, which would be position 3 or 4, depending on where the nitro is. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so where you add the nitro doesn't matter for substit
