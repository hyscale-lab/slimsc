Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, precipitate G, and another product B. There are a few clues here that I need to piece together.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That makes me think about elements that have common isotopes. For example, chlorine has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37, so maybe X has chlorine in it. Or perhaps it's something like sulfur or another element with multiple isotopes.

The reaction produces gas W, whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, wait, same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about what molecules have that. For example, water has H and O, but H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. Maybe CO2? No, CO2 is O=12, C=6. Alternatively, maybe something like O2 or N2? Wait, O2 would have 8 protons each, and if it's O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (like O-16). So O2 would have 16 neutrons total? No, wait, the molecule's total. Wait, the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, count the sum of protons in all atoms and the sum of neutrons in all atoms.

Wait, let me think. Another possibility: methane (CH4) doesn't fit. What about H2O? No, because H has 1 proton each, O has 8. For H2O, protons would be 2 (H) + 8 (O) =10, neutrons would be 0 (H) + 8 (O) =8. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons, not equal. Not matching.

Wait, maybe it's carbon monoxide (CO)? CO has 6 protons (C) + 8 (O) =14. Neutrons: C is 6 (if C-12), O is 8 (O-16). So 6+8=14, same
