Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n. The formula given is E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is the ground state energy for n=1. 

Wait, the question is asking about the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system. Since there are four particles, I think I need to consider their arrangement in the energy levels, but wait—since they're spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions, right? So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each energy level can hold a certain number of particles.

But wait, in a one-dimensional well, each energy level (each n) can have how many particles? Spin-1/2 means each particle has two possible spin states, so each n can hold two particles—because each spatial orbital can have two electrons with opposite spins. Oh wait, no, wait a second. In 1D, the energy levels are non-degenerate. So for each n, there's a single state, but with spin multiplicity. So each n can hold 2 particles because of spin up and down.

So four particles. Let's think about how they fill up the energy levels.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energies. Each n can take two particles. So n=1 can have 2, n=2 can have another 2. So the first two levels are filled with 4 particles. 

Wait
