Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water, which suggests that one of the components is an alkene or alkyne because they can react with bromine. Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but has two other liquids. Importantly, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, which means the products presumably don't have any double bonds anymore.

The next part says that when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation with platinum under severe conditions, only one substance Z is formed. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. That's interesting because 14.28% is approximately 1/7, which might relate to the molecular formula. Also, Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Oh, and Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's fully saturatedâ€”no double or triple bonds left.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's identify what X and Y might be.

Mixture X: equimolar two liquids, decolorizes bromine. So possible components are alkenes (since they can add bromine and decolorize). Alternatively, maybe an alkyne, which can also decolorize bromine, but let's see.

When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes disproportionation to form Y. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps a diene or something that can split into different products with different oxidation states. Wait, but X is a mixture, so maybe each component undergoes a reaction.

Wait, but the problem says "mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation." Hmm, so maybe the mixture X consists of two compounds that each undergo a reaction (possibly the same type) to form two other compounds in Y.

Wait, but the problem says "result of disproportionation," which suggests that each component
