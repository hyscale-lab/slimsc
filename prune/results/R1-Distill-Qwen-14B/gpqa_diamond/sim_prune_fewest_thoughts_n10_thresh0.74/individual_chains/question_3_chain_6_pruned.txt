Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. The formula I remember is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So, the operator in question is 10σz + 5σx. I think I can compute the expectation value of each part separately and then add them together. Because expectation values are linear, so ⟨A+B⟩ = ⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩.

Let me denote the state as |ψ⟩. So, |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, but wait, I should check if this is a normalized state. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the coefficients. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Adding them together gives 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good, no need to normalize.

First, let's find the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right?

So, ⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩. Let me write this out. The state is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so I can compute each term.

Breaking it down, |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2.

So, ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩ = a^* a (1) + b^* b (-1). Because when σz acts on |↑⟩, it gives 1 * |↑⟩, and on |↓⟩, it gives -1 * |↓⟩. So the expectation is |a|^2 * 1 + |b|^2 * (-1).

Calculating, |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 *1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So the expectation value of σz is -0.5.

Next, compute the expectation value of σx. Hmm, this is a bit trickier because σx doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. I remember σx is the spin in the x-direction, and its eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down along x, which are different. So, I can't directly use the same approach as with σz.

Wait, but perhaps I can express σx in terms of the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ basis. Or maybe I can compute the expectation value using the matrix representation.

The Pauli matrices: σz is diagonal, [[1,0],[0,-1]], and σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, the state |ψ⟩ can be written as a column vector. Let me represent |↑⟩ as [1; 0] and |↓⟩ as [0; 1]. So,

|ψ⟩ = 0.5 [1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0; 1] =
