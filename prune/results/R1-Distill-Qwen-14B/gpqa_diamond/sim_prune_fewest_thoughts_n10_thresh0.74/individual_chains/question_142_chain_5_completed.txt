Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that the density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. But what about the geometrical position?

I think the density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3D space using the Bloch sphere. Oh right, for a single qubit, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize quantum states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

So, the general form of the density matrix for a single qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector). Each component of r corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So ρ can be written as (I + σ_x r_x + σ_y r_y + σ_z r_z)/2.

Wait, let me write down the given ρ again: (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2. Oh, because (1/2)(I) is the same as (I + 0·σ)/2. So that would mean r·σ is zero. So the vector r must be (0,0,0). Because if r is zero, then it's just (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state.

Wait, in the Bloch sphere representation, the maximally mixed state is at the origin. Because the pure states are on the surface, and the most mixed state (like equal probabilities for 0 and 1) would be the center. So the density matrix I have here, ρ, is the completely mixed state, which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. So the geometrical position would be (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix for a single qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), since there are no Pauli matrix terms, \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
