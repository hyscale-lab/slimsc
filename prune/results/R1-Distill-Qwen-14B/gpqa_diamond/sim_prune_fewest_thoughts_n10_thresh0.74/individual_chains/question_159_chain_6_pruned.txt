Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about quasars and comoving distance. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And at shorter wavelengths, the flux drops. That makes me think about redshift because if the peak is in the infrared, maybe the quasar's emission is being redshifted.

Wait, the peak at 790 nm—what is that in terms of rest frame? I remember that in the optical range, certain emission lines are prominent. Like H-alpha is around 656 nm in the rest frame. If the observed wavelength is longer (790 nm), that suggests redshift. So the redshift z would be (observed - rest)/rest. So (790 - 656)/656 = (134)/656 ≈ 0.204. So z ≈ 0.2. But wait, could it be a different line? Oh, maybe Lyman alpha? No, Lyman alpha is in UV, so rest is around 121 nm. Then 790/121 ≈ 6.5, so z=5.5. But in that case, the flux at shorter wavelengths would be even lower? Or wait, maybe I'm thinking of the inverse. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer break or something else. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question says that the peak is at 790 nm and flux drops at wavelengths shorter than that. So perhaps the peak is the Lyman limit or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the peak of the blackbody spectrum, so the peak wavelength relates to temperature via Wien's law. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the Lyman-alpha forest? But I don't think that's relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is the 912 Å (which is 91.2 nm) Lyman limit, but that would be observed at 790 nm, which would be a huge redshift. Let me calculate that. Observed wavelength λ_obs = 790 nm. Rest λ_rest = 91.2 nm. So z = (790 -91.2)/91.2
