Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait a second—that's a 3-component vector. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors in a Hilbert space, and they should be normalized, right? Let me check the norm of this vector. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of each component. So, (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Summing those gives 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Oh, so the state isn't normalized. That might complicate things later, but maybe I can normalize it first.

Wait, no, actually, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically unit vectors. So perhaps the given state isn't normalized, and I need to normalize it before proceeding? Because otherwise, the probabilities might not add up correctly.

So, given the state vector: ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let's compute its norm: sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

But the question is about measuring P and then Q. So, first, I need to find the probability of getting a certain value for P, and then, after measuring P, the state would collapse into an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q on that new state would give a different probability.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1 in that order. Oh wait, no: the measurements are first P, then Q. So the probability is the product of the probability of getting P=0, and then, given that the state collapsed to that eigenstate, the probability of getting Q=-1 in that state.

Alternatively, maybe the order is that P is measured first, then Q is measured. So the overall probability is the probability that P=0 multiplied by
