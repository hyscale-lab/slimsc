Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know about qPCR and calibration curves.

The question says that a scientist is setting up a calibration curve for his qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in a series of concentrations. He ran three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, which I remember means that each cycle perfectly doubles the DNA, so the efficiency formula (E = 100% gives E = 1) would be used in the calculation. The RÂ² is 1, which means the data perfectly fit the curve, so the calibration should be good. The slope is -3.3. Wait, the slope in a qPCR curve is related to efficiency. I think the formula for the slope (m) is m = log(E) / log(10), but wait, no, the standard formula I remember is m = 1 / (slope * log(10)), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the slope of the calibration curve (which is typically a linear regression of log(copy number) vs Ct) is related to the efficiency. Oh right, the formula is usually something like the slope equals -1/(log(E)/log(10)), but maybe I'm getting it wrong. Wait, the standard formula is that the slope is -1 / (log(E) * log(10)), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think for a 100% efficient PCR (E=1), the slope would be -1, because the PCR doubles each cycle, so each tenfold increase in copies would take about 3.33 cycles (since log2(10)=~3.33). So if the slope is -3.3, that's approximately -3.3, which makes sense because each 10x dilution would cause an increase of about 3.33 in Ct. Wait, but in the data, the Ct increases as the concentration decreases, right? Because higher starting quantity leads to lower Ct since it reaches the threshold faster.

Looking at the data: the Ct values go down as the concentration goes up. For example, 100,000 copies have a Ct of around 34, while
