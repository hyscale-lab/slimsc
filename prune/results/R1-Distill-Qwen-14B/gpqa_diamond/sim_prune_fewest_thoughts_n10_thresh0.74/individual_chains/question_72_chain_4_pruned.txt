Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it combines with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form 2. Next, 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form 3. Finally, 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4. The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. I think I'll need to figure out the structure of each intermediate step to determine what's happening. Let me try to break this down.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So the structure looks like a bicyclic system with an oxygen-containing substituent.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, especially in SN2 reactions. Also, when dibromo compounds are involved, sometimes elimination can happen, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the diene is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group. The structure would be:

CH2Br2 attached at C5 and C6 of the cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

When this reacts with sodium iodide, which is typically a way to substitute bromides. So the Br in the dibromomethyl groups might be replaced by iodide. But wait, sodium iodide in a reaction with dibromomethyl groups? Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the diene is undergoing some kind of addition. Wait, but the starting material is a bicycloheptadiene. So perhaps this is a Diels-Alder type reaction? Because the starting molecule is a diene, and the other compound has two dienophile groups?

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexadiene has two substituents, each with two bromine atoms on methyl groups. So each of the 5 and 6 positions is a CH2Br2.

Wait, but if the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, then it has two double bonds. So perhaps this is a diene and a di
