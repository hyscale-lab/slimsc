Okay, so I have this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that when observing a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum, there's a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared, and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm). I remember that when objects are very far away, their light gets redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. So if the observed wavelength is longer, the original emission must have been at a shorter wavelength.

Wait, wait. The peak is at 790 nm. Normally, in the rest frame of the quasar, this peak would be in a particular part of the spectrum. Let me think, near infrared is about 700-2500 nm or so. So 790 nm is near the red end of that. If the quasar emitted this peak at a shorter wavelength, like optical, say around 550 nm (green), but we see it redshifted to 790 nm. How much redshift is that?

Redshift z is calculated by (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. So, z = (790 - λ_emit)/λ_emit. Let's say λ_emit is 550 nm (visible light), then z = (790-550)/550 ≈ 240/550 ≈ 0.436. But wait, maybe the peak is actually from the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is at 121.6 nm in the rest frame. Oh, right! Quasars often have strong emission lines, and Lyman-alpha is a prominent one in the ultraviolet. If we observe it in the near-infrared, that's a significant redshift.

So, if Lyman-alpha is observed at 790 nm, then z = (790 - 121.6)/121.6 ≈ 668.4 / 121.6 ≈ 5.5. That would be a high redshift. So z is around 5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar. The comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters. The given parameters are H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm = 0.3, dark energy Ωλ = 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ωm + Ωλ =1).

I remember that comoving distance (D_C) relates to the redshift via an integral involving the Hubble parameter. The formula for D_C is c multiplied by the integral from 0 to z of dz' / H(z'), where H(z') is the Hubble parameter at redshift z'.

H(z) is given by H0 * sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ). So for a flat universe, the expansion history is determined by these two components.

So, to find D_C, I need to compute the integral ∫0^z (dz') / [sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ)].

But wait, wait. What's the actual formula? Oh right, the comoving distance for a flat universe is (c/H0) * ∫0^z dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ*(1+z)^0) because dark energy's equation of state is assumed to be w=-1, so it scales as a^-3(1+w)=a^0.

So, E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ).

Hmm, so I need to compute this integral from 0 to z≈5.5, with Ωm=0.3 and Ωλ=0.7.

Wait, but I don't remember the exact value.
