Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the answer is. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The data provided are the IR and 1H NMR spectra of compound X.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are in the regions: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. Hmm, I remember that IR peaks can give clues about functional groups. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 might indicate an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an amine. But wait, 3400 is usually a broad peak for O-H in alcohols or maybe a carboxylic acid. But let me check the other peaks.

The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, I'm thinking there's an aromatic ring with substituents. The 1450 might also be indicative of some kind of substitution pattern on the ring.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let's break it down.

The 1H NMR shows several signals:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but that's a triplet or something else. Alternatively, maybe a carboxylic acid proton? Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, but they can be broad because they exchange with water. So maybe that's a -COOH group.

But wait, there's another peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That's probably aromatic protons. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) is another doublet
