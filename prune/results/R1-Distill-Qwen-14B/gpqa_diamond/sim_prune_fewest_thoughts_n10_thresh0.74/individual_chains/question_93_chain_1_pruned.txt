Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the scientist is making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He's done serial dilutions—so each step is a tenfold dilution, I think. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration.

The efficiency is 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which means it's a perfect fit; no scatter in the data. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I think the slope in a qPCR calibration curve relates to efficiency. The formula for slope is -3.32 divided by the efficiency, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. The standard formula for the slope is -3.3219 / E, where E is the efficiency. So if E is 100%, or 1, then the slope would be -3.3219. But the given slope is -3.3, which is close enough, maybe due to rounding. So that makes sense.

So, the data points: for each concentration, the Ct values are given as triplets. Let's see, the concentrations are 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10 copies per microliter. For each, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5; 30.6, 30.9, 31.2; and so on. So each concentration's Ct is about 3.3 cycles higher than the next lower concentration.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about how qPCR works. Each dilution is tenfold, so the DNA amount decreases by a factor of 10 each time. So if the efficiency is 100%, each cycle reduces the Ct by 1 (since each cycle doubles the DNA, so to reach the same threshold, you need one less cycle for each tenfold increase in starting amount).

Wait, the relationship between Ct and log of starting quantity is linear. The slope is negative, so as quantity increases, Ct decreases. 

At 100000, Ct is around 34. Then 10000 is about 30.6. The difference is about 3.3. Oh, that's the slope. Because each tenfold increase (so each dilution step) should change the Ct by about 3.3 cycles, in a perfect scenario.

Looking at the data, each concentration's Ct is about 3.3 cycles higher than the next. For example, 34.5 minus 31.2 is about 3.3. Similarly, 31.2 minus 27.9 is about 3.3. The same for the others. So the Ct values are decreasing by 3.3 as the concentration decreases by a factor of 10. That aligns with the expected slope of -3.3. 

So, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. Looking at the options:

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. That's not true because he successfully created a calibration curve with R² 1 and 100% efficiency. So A is incorrect.

Option B says Ct values don't agree with target amount. But looking at the data, they do align perfectly. Each tenfold dilution leads to a 3.3 Ct change. So B seems wrong.

Option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, ten-fold is exactly 3.3 cycles when E=100% because 2^3.3 ≈ 10 (since 2^3=8, 2^3.3≈10). So a tenfold increase in DNA would
