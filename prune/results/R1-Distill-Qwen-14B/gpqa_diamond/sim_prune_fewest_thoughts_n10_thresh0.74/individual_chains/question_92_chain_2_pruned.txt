Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I need to break this down.

First, I should remember what enthalpy of formation means. Oh right, it's the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for this molecule, I need to figure out how many moles of each element (like C and H) are involved and then use the given bond energies to calculate it.

Wait, the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is something like: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies broken) - (sum of bond energies formed). Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no. I think it's the reverse. When bonds are formed, they release energy (exothermic), so the enthalpy change is negative. But wait, no, the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to form the molecule from elements. So I think it's the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the bond energies of the products.

Wait no, maybe it's the sum of all the bond energies in the reactants (elements) minus the bond energies in the product. Let me think. For example, when you form a molecule, you break bonds in the reactants and form new bonds in the products. So the enthalpy change
