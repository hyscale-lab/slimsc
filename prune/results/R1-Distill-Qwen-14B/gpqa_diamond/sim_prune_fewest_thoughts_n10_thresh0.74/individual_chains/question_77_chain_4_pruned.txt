Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about two different reactions. The first part (A) involves a compound reacting with BuLi and then H+, and the second part (B) is a Cope rearrangement upon heating. I need to select the correct major products from the options provided.

Let's start with part A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me draw it out in my mind. Benzene ring with a substituent â€” specifically, an ( oxy)methyl group attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, so the structure would be benzene-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me correct that. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2 (but wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at the second carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- but as a substituent. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl should be CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl group would be CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. Oh wait, but the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at position 2? No, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, but that's a 4-membered group. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3
