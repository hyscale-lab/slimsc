Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors: the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so I can ignore that part.

First, the star's parameters: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff is 6300 K. Wait, Teff is the effective temperature of the star, right? That's the one that comes into the flux equation.

The planets: Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 has 5 Earth masses and radius 1.3 Earth radii. But wait, I don't think their masses or radii directly affect their equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature is more about how much energy they receive from the star, not their own properties. So I can probably ignore the mass and focus on the orbital parameters.

The question mentions they used the transit and radial velocity methods. The transit method gives the radius of the planet (since the dip in brightness depends on the planet's size relative to the star), and the RV method gives the mass (since the wobble of the star depends on the planet's mass and orbital period). But for equilibrium temperature, I think the key is the semi-major axis of their orbits, which would come from the radial velocity data.

Wait, the question gives information about the Doppler shifts. Oh right! The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift is related to the mass of the planet and the size of the orbit.

So, the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of up to 0.04 Å. I need to relate these shifts to the semi-major axis of each planet.

Hmm, how do I connect Doppler shift to the planet's orbital parameters? I remember that the maximum Doppler shift (v) is given by v = (G * M_star * sin i) / ( (M_planet + M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(
