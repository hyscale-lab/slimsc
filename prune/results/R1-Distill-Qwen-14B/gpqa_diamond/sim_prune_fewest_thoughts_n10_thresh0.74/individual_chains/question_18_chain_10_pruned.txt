Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I remember that in astronomy, [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of the abundance of element X to Y compared to the Sun. Oh right, it's log base 10 of (X/Y / (X/Y)_Sun). So [X/Y] = log(X/Y) - log(X/Y)_Sun.

The question gives me the abundances for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's list out the given data.

Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 times the Sun.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So Si is more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's H abundance.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if it's 0, that means (Fe/H)_star = (Fe/H)_sun. So Fe abundance is same as Sun relative to H.

Similarly, for Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 times the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So Mg is more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So Mg abundance is same as the Sun's H.

Wait, but what's the question again? The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So we need (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

I think I can approach this by finding the abundance of Si in each star relative to H, then take the ratio.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:
We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So Si/Fe = 10^0.3 * (Fe/Si)_sun.

Wait, no. The [X/Y] notation is log(X/Y) - log(X/Y)_sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3.

So log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log(Si/Fe)_sun
