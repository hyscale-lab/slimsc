Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're in a system with circular orbits, and they were discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, I think. But I'm not sure how that affects the problem, maybe it's just background info.

The problem gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between the planets. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. Then the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. All have the same albedo as Earth, which is 0.3.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.

Hmm. So I need to find the ratio of P3/P1.

Let me think about the factors affecting equilibrium temperature and orbital period.

Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis), and the planet's albedo. The formula I remember is:

Teq = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * d²) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

Teq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 d) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

Wait, T_star is the star's effective temperature. Hmm, but perhaps in this problem, the star's properties are the same for all three planets, so those terms can be factored out.

Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets could be written as ( (1 - a1)/(1 - a2) )^(1/4) * (d2/d1)^(1/2 )

Since all albedos are the same (a1 = a2 = a3 = 0.3), the (1 - a) terms are equal, so they cancel out. So the ratio of Teq between two planets would be sqrt( d2 / d1 ). Wait, no, because the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So if
