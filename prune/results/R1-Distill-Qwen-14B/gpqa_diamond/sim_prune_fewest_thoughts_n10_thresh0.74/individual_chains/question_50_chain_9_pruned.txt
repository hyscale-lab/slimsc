Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the number of loops in a Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the topology of the diagram and the possible divergences that occur.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to find out how many loops are in the diagram based on this. 

Wait, I remember that Feynman diagrams with loops contribute to loop integrals, and each loop typically introduces a factor involving integrals over loop momenta. The power of the coupling constants and other factors might relate to the number of loops. Oh, right, the superficial degree of divergence or the loop count can be determined by analyzing the dimensions of the terms.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to look at the general form of loop integrals. For example, a one-loop diagram would have an integral that goes something like d^4k/(2pi)^4, but when regularized, like in dimensional regularization, the integrals can look different. But wait, the problem mentions regularization, so maybe it's about the dependence on energy scales and coupling constants.

Wait, another thought: each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) from the integral in four dimensions. Because in four dimensions, a loop integral like âˆ«d^4k/(2pi)^4 would have a denominator with (2pi)^4, so 1/(2pi)^4 is part of the integral. But when considering loop expansion, each loop brings in a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) because (2pi)^4 is 16 pi^2 times (4 pi)^4, wait no, wait:

Wait, (2pi)^4 is 16 pi^4. So 1/(2pi)^4 is 1/(16 pi^4). But I might be getting mixed up here. Alternatively, when you have a loop integral, the typical factor from the integral might involve 1/(16 pi^2) for each loop. Because in four dimensions, each loop contributes a 1/(16 pi^2) factor.

So the given expression has a denominator of (4 pi)^6. Let me compute that: (4 pi)^6 = (4^6) (pi^6) = 4096 pi^6. So the denominator is (4pi)^6, which is (4 pi)^6 = (4^6) (pi^6) = 4096 pi^6. So the denominator is (4 pi)^6, which is 4^6 pi^6. 

Wait, but for each loop, the integral contributes 1/(16 pi^2) as a factor. So if there are L loops, the factor would be (1/(16 pi^2))^L.

Let me look at the denominator in the given expression: 1/(4 pi)^6 = (1/(4 pi))^6 = (1/(4^6 pi^6)) = 1/(4096 pi^6). 

Hmm, but for each loop, we
