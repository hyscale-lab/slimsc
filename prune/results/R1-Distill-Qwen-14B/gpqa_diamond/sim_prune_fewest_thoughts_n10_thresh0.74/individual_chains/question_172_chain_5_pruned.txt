Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2's. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. Oh right, excitation energy relates to the temperature because in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Isn't 1.38 something like Boltzmann's constant k? Oh wait, k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k times some temperature-related term?

The Boltzmann factor is e^(-ΔE/(k*T)). The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by this factor. So if n1 and n2 are the populations in the two stars, then n1/n2 = e^(-ΔE/(k T)). 

In this problem, for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited." I'm not sure if that refers to the number in the excited state being twice, or the excitation energy per atom is twice. Oh, probably the number in the excited state. So n1 is twice n
