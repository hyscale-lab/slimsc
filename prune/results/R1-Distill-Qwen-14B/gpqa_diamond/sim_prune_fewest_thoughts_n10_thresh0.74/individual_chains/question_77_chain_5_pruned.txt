Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products from two different reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves the Cope rearrangement, which I remember is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It usually happens in 1,5-dienes, right? So when heat or light is applied, the molecule rearranges, moving the double bonds.

Looking at the first part of the problem, we have a starting material: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me draw its structure mentally. So it's a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxygen connected to a methyl group (OCH2), and that methyl is attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, what's that? The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-OCH2-C6H5?

Wait, maybe I should write it out. The substituent on benzene is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl. So, the but-2-en-1-yl part is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond starting at position 2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-Ph? No, wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl. So maybe it's OCH2-C(R)=CH-CH2-CH3? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl benzene. So the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So numbering starts from the end attached to the oxygen. So the group is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-O-CH2-C
