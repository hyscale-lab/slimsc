Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the potentials in electromagnetism when a point charge is moving. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are described using scalar and vector potentials.

The question gives me a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t), and I'm supposed to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r at time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). 

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different expressions for V and A. I need to figure out which one is correct.

So, thinking back, the scalar potential for a static charge is straightforward. It's V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But wait, when the charge is moving, does the scalar potential change? Oh right, for the scalar potential due to a moving charge, in the Lorenz gauge, it's the same as the static case if we ignore the time variations because the scalar potential depends on the charge's position. Wait, but maybe that's not the case because of retarded time or something? No, wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge in the Lorenz gauge is still based on the charge's position at the retarded time. Wait, but in this problem, the options are given without any time derivatives, so perhaps they're assuming the static case or that the charge isn't accelerating too much.

Wait, the options for V are either q/(4πε₀ r) or some expression with (dc - d·v) in the denominator. Hmm, I think that when the charge is moving, the scalar potential depends on the retarded time, which involves the distance d and the velocity v. Oh wait, but the expressions in the options have terms like 'd c - d·v'—so maybe that's from the denominator in the retarded potential calculations.

Wait, remembering the retarded time τ is given by τ = t - (r·v + d c)/c², but wait no, I think the correct expression is τ = (r - (v (t - τ))) · (1 - (v²/c²)) or something, but perhaps more accurately, the denominator would involve (d c - d·v), but I'm not sure.

Wait, more accurately, the denominator in the expression for the scalar potential when considering the retarded time would involve terms like (r - (v τ_diff)), where τ_diff is the time difference. Alternatively, the denominator would be (d c - (d · v)), where d is the vector from the charge's position at time τ to the observation point r. So that in the expression for V, the denominator becomes (d c - d·v). 

Wait, let me think. The standard expression for the scalar potential for a moving charge in terms of the retarded time would be V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀) * 1/(r - (v τ)), but I'm not exactly getting that. Alternatively, the denominator is (r - (v (t - τ))) ... but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the denominator as (d c - (d · v)), as in option C and D.

So, looking at the options, option C has V as qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and option D has qc/(4πε₀ (d c + d·v)).

Wait, but the scalar potential for a static charge is q/(4πε₀ r), which is option A and B have V as this. So if the charge is moving, perhaps the scalar potential is modified. But in reality, in the Lorenz gauge, the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge would involve these terms. 

Alternatively, maybe the scalar potential is the same as the static case, but the vector potential isn't. Wait, but the vector potential for a moving charge isn't zero, right? Because a moving charge creates a magnetic field, so the vector potential can't be zero.

The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field. For a charge moving with velocity v, the magnetic field is B = (μ₀ q/(4π)) (v × (d hat)) / (d² c), or something like that. But the vector potential A is given by (μ₀/(4π)) (q v) / (d² c). Wait, no, more accurately, for the vector potential due to a moving charge, I think it's A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π d² c) * (d hat). Or perhaps it's (μ₀ q v)/(4π (d c - d·v)^2) multiplied by (d - (v τ) ) or something.

Wait, perhaps the vector potential is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π (d c - d·v)) times some unit vector. Alternatively, since d is the vector from the charge's position at time τ to the observation point, the denominator would be (d c - d·v), perhaps squared? Or is it linear?

Looking back at the options, option B has the vector potential as (v / c²) times V. So if V is q/(4πε₀ r), then A would be (v/c²) times that. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, in the Lorenz gauge, the potentials satisfy certain conditions, like ∇·A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t = 0. But perhaps that's complicating things for this problem.

Alternatively, considering that the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge can be determined using the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀) [1/(r - v(t - τ)) ], where τ is the time when the charge was at position r - v τ. Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the general expression for the potentials is:

V(r, t) = (q / (4π ε₀)) * [1/( |r - r'(t - τ)| ) ]

and A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / (4π)) * [v'(t - τ) / ( |r - r'(t - τ)| c² ) ]

But maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, from the Jefimenko equations, which express E and B fields in terms of V and A, but perhaps that's not directly helpful here.

Wait, perhaps looking at the form of the potentials. The scalar potential for a moving charge would involve the charge's velocity in the denominator. So the denominator would have terms like (d c - d·v), as in options C and D.

Looking again, option C and D are the only ones where V is not the static case. So if the charge is moving, the potentials should involve the velocity in their expressions.

So the scalar potential would be V = (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - (d · v))], and the vector potential would be A = [μ₀ q c v ] / [4π (d c - (d · v)) ].

Wait, but in option C, V is (qc)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

So the denominator in both V and A is the same. So that's option C.

Option D has a plus in the denominator, which would make the denominator larger if the numerator is positive, but I think the denominator should involve (d c - (d·v)) because the charge's velocity affects the time it takes for the field to reach the observation point.

Wait, but why is there a 'c' in the numerator of V? Because in the static case, it's q/(4πε₀ r), but when considering the moving charge, perhaps the terms get scaled by c.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the correct expressions. The scalar potential due to a moving charge in the Lorenz gauge is given by V = [q/(4π ε₀)] * [ 1/( |d| sqrt( (c² - v²)^2 + ... ) ) ]? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: For a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials are often expressed in terms of the Lorentz transformation of the static case. But perhaps that's getting too deep.

Alternatively, considering that the potentials should satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to both E and B fields.

Wait, the expression for V when the charge is moving would have a term involving the velocity in the denominator, as in V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d · v)). Because the charge's motion affects the potential. Similarly, the vector potential would involve the velocity v multiplied by some factor.

So, looking at the options, option C and D have this form. In option C, the denominator is (d c - d·v), and in D, it's (d c + d·v). I think the correct denominator is (d c - d·v), because when the charge is moving towards the observer, the distance is effectively decreasing, so the denominator would be smaller, making V larger (since you're dividing by a smaller number). That makes sense if the charge is moving towards you, you'd feel a stronger field sooner.

So, V would be (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A would be (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Looking at the options, option C matches this.

Alternatively, if I think about the units. V should have units of volts, which is J/C, which is equivalent to (N m)/(A m), or (kg m^2/s^3 A). Let's check the option C's units.

V in option C is (qc)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)).

The numerator is q c. The denominator is (d c - d·v), which has units of m^2/s (since d is in meters, c in m/s, and d·v is m·m/s = m²/s). So denominator has units m²/s.

So, V's units would be (C·(m/s)) / ( (m²/s) ) ) → (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) → (C) / m.

But the correct unit for voltage (V) is (kg·m²)/(A·s³), which is equivalent to (C·m)/(kg·m²) ??? Wait, perhaps better to compute the units.

Wait, ε₀ has units of C²/(N·m²) → C²/(kg·m/s² · m²) → C² s²/(kg·m³).

So, 1/(4π ε₀) has units kg·m³/(C² s²).

Multiply by q (C), so (kg·m³/(C² s²)) * C → kg·m³/(C s²).

Then, the denominator is (d c - d·v) which is m^2/s. So, 1/(that) → s/m².

So overall, V = [kg·m³/(C s²)] * [s/m²] → kg·m/(C s).

Which is (kg·m/(C s)) = (kg·m²/s²)/(C·m/s) ) ? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on units. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the wave equations or other properties.

Wait, another approach: the potentials should satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field via E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. The vector potential contributes to the magnetic field via B = ∇×A.

But perhaps that's complicating things.

Another thought: The vector potential A should be related to the velocity of the charge. So for a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential should involve v. Looking at the options, options B and D have A proportional to v, while others have v squared or not.

In option B, A is (v/c²) V. But wait, in SI units, the vector potential due to a charge moving with velocity v would have terms like (μ₀ q v)/(4π d² c²) * something.

Wait, let me think about the expression. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v)/(c² d) ), where d is the distance. But wait, in terms of the denominator in the options, it's (d c - d·v). So perhaps option C is correct.

Alternatively, considering that the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4 π (d c - d·v)), as in option C.

So putting it all together, option C has both V and A expressed in terms of (d c - d·v), which seems correct. Therefore, the correct answer is C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the principles of electromagnetism. The scalar potential \( V \) is influenced by the charge's motion, and the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) arises due to the magnetic field generated by the moving charge. The denominator in both potentials includes a term \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d \) is the distance between the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) and the observation point \( \vec{r} \), \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: The scalar potential \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \) corresponds to the static case, where the charge is not moving. However, since the charge is moving, this does not account for the effects of motion, such as the retarded time or the velocity-dependent terms in the denominator. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: The vector potential \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V \) suggests a dependence on the velocity \( \vec{v} \), but the scalar potential \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \) again corresponds to the static case. This option does not include the velocity-dependent term \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) in the denominator, making it incorrect.

3. **Option C**: The scalar potential \( V = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) and the vector potential \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) include the correct velocity-dependent term \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) in the denominator. This matches the expected form of the potentials for a moving charge, as derived from Maxwell's equations and the retarded potential formalism. This option is consistent with the principles of electromagnetism.

4. **Option D**: The scalar potential \( V = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) and the vector potential \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) include a \( + \) sign in the denominator instead of a \( - \). This is incorrect because the denominator should involve \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), as derived from the retarded time formalism.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials, accounting for the motion of the charge, are given in **Option C**. These expressions include the velocity-dependent term \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) in the denominator, consistent with the retarded potential formulation.
