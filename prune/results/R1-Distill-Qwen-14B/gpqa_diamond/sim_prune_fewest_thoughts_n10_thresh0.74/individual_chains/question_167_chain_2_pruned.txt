Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). Got it. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

The non-Gaussianity here is calculated using the relative entropy measure, del_b, which is the difference in the von Neumann entropy between the state rho (the cat state) and the reference Gaussian state tau. So del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

Wait, but wait. The problem says "non-Gaussianity using relative entropy measure." So I think the idea is that the relative entropy between rho and tau gives a measure of how non-Gaussian rho is. Because if rho is Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

But wait, how do I approach calculating this? I remember that for a Gaussian state, the von Neumann entropy depends on the purity and maybe the squeezing or something. But for a cat state, which is a superposition of coherent states, it's highly non-Gaussian, so the entropy would be different.

But hold on, maybe it's easier than that. Let's see what the state looks like for the given parameters.

Given phi = -pi/4. Let's compute sin(2phi). 2*(-pi/4) is -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1.

Then N squared is 1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2). Let me compute exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, but wait. The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Let's plug in phi = -pi/4. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state becomes [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / N.

Wait, but since the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite amplitudes, this looks like a cat state, which is known to be highly non-Gaussian. So the state rho would have a density matrix that's a mixture of these states, which would have a higher entropy than the Gaussian state
