Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the situation is that there's a star similar to the Sun, but a bit bigger—1.5 times the Sun's radius. There's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around it. This planet transits in front of the star, and the impact parameter is 0.2. The orbital period is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet, bigger—2.5 Earth radii—that we need to consider. The question is asking for the maximum orbital period of this second planet so that both transit and occultation events can occur. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, and the second planet also has a circular orbit.

Hmm. I remember that for a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. And occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so from our perspective, the star eclipses the planet. So both events require that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on, just like the first planet.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum orbital period. Oh, right, because the orbital period determines the size of the orbit. Since both planets must transit and occult, their orbital distances must be arranged so that they can both do these events without their orbital planes causing one to be out of the other's way? Or perhaps, more accurately, the orbital periods relate to their orbital distances via Kepler's third law.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum period for the second planet. So the second planet must be in a position where its orbit allows it to both pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star. But how does the period relate to that?

Let me think about the concept of transit and occultation. For a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be aligned such that it crosses the line of sight to the star. Similarly, for occultation, the planet must be on the far side of the star relative to us, so the star blocks the planet.

But how does the orbital period of the second planet affect this? I think the key here is that both planets must have their orbital planes aligned. But wait, the problem states that the second planet shares the same orbital plane as the first. So if the first planet transits, the second must also transit, but the planet's size and orbital period affect whether it can actually transit.

Wait, but both are in the same orbital plane, so the alignment is already correct for both to transit and occult. But the question is about the maximum period the second planet can have so that it still transits and occults. Maybe this is about the Hill sphere or orbital stability, but I don't think that's it here.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is about the relative orbital speeds and the timing of transits and occultations. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the planets must be in a configuration where their orbital periods allow for the possibility of both transiting and occulting. Because if one planet's
