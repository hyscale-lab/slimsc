Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I think I should start by understanding what the question is asking. The problem gives me a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, it's a measure of the stability of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the different β values correspond to different complex ions. For example, β1 might be for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-? Or maybe the order is different. Wait, each β represents a step in the formation. So if β1 is for the first SCN binding, then each subsequent β is the next step.

So, the complexes would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+  with β1 = 9
[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)2]^0  with β2 =40
[Co(SCN)2]^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)3]^-  with β3=63
[Co(SCN)3]^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)4]^2-  with β4=16

Wait, but the β values are for each step. So the overall formation constant for each complex would be the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. For example, the overall β for [Co(SCN)2]^0 would be β1*β2, right? Wait, no, the overall β is the product of all previous β's. Hmm, but what exactly are the β's given? I think in this context, each β is for the nth step, so the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn
