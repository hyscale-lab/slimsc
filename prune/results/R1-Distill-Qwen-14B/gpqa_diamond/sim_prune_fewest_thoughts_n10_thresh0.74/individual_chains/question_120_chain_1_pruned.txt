Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I remember that parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax, right? Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is nearby, its parallax is bigger, and as they get farther away, the parallax gets smaller.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (let's call it plx) changes with plx. So, like, how does the density of stars in a certain parallax bin change as the parallax value changes.

I think I remember something about the distribution of stars with distance or parallax. Oh wait, stars are not uniformly distributed in space, but the question says to assume they are uniformly distributed. Oh, interesting. So, in reality, the distribution is more complicated because of the Milky Way structure, but here we're just assuming they're spread out uniformly.

So, if stars are uniformly distributed, their number should depend on how much volume is at a particular distance. But wait, parallax relates to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) plx is equal to 1/distance in parsecs, so d = 1/plx.

In a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a certain volume would increase with volume. But as you go to larger distances, the same volume corresponds to a larger range in distance. So, the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Hmm. So, let's model this.

Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance. plx = 1/d. So, when plx increases, the distance d decreases. So, each small change in plx corresponds to a specific change in d.

The number of stars in a thin shell (like between d and d + dd) would be proportional to the surface area of the shell times the thickness, right? Wait, but in 3D, the volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² dd, assuming uniform distribution.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, let's substitute d in terms of plx.

So, number of stars in a shell is proportional
