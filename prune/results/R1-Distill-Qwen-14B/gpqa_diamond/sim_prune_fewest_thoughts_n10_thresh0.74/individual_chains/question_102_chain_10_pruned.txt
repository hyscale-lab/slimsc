Okay, so I've got this pretty complicated question here about molecular biology and genetic constructs. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're trying to figure out why a certain fluorescent signal isn't showing up in a mouse model. The setup involves a bicistronic vector with loxP and lox2272 cassettes, along with some fluorescent markers. 

First, let me understand the vector setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (open reading frames) under the same promoter. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, typically used for expression in various tissues. The receptor has an IRES regulatory element upstream of it. 

Wait, IRES elements are Internal Ribosome Entry Sites. IRES allows a ribosome to translate the downstream mRNA even if the upstream part is not translated. So, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES, which is a weaker system but allows for some expression without needing a second promoter. 

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. These stop cassettes probably prevent expression unless the lox sites are recombined. LoxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. Lox2272 is another variant; I think it's a site that Cre can also recognize but with higher specificity or perhaps different recombination orientation.

So when Cre is present, it should recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes. For the ligand-mCherry, the loxP sites would be cut, allowing the ligand to be expressed along with mCherry. Similarly, for the receptor-eGFP, the lox2272 would be cut, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

Now, the experiment involves creating a mouse model homozygous for this construct. They cross these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, like the cells expressing these ligand and receptor.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signals. The green would come from eGFP expression. But they don't see it. So why?

The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship
B) receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi
C) enhancer for ligand and receptor expression missing
D) receptor and eGFP not in frame

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Paracrine means the ligand is secreted and acts on other cells' receptors.
