Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about an annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide and produce two A+ and two A- particles. The given information is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A times c squared is 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, first, I remember that when particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other forms of energy, like kinetic energy or the rest mass of the resulting particles. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, but the problem says it's moving slowly, which I think implies that its velocity is small compared to the speed of light, so perhaps we can approximate it as non-relativistic? Or maybe just use relativistic equations without approximation.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving." So that probably means it's moving at a low speed, so non-relativistic? Or maybe not, because in particle physics, even "slow" might be a significant fraction of the speed of light. Hmm, maybe I should think about the conservation of energy and momentum here.

In the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum before collision is zero because the proton and antiproton have equal and opposite momenta if they're moving towards each other. Wait, but the problem states the antiproton is moving, but what about the proton? Oh, wait, the initial setup might have the proton
