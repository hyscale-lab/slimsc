Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, so it's entirely inside the conductor.

Now, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields. So, when a conductor is uncharged, any charge placed inside a cavity affects the charges induced on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, but in this case, the conductor was initially uncharged, and then some charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So, how does that work?

Wait, in a conductor, the charges redistribute themselves. So when a charge is placed inside a cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface must have an induced charge equal to +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Oh, wait no. Wait, if the conductor was uncharged, and we add +q inside the cavity, then the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it. Because the conductor's total charge must be zero, so inner surface is -q, outer +q.

But wait, the conductor originally was neutral. So when +q is placed inside, the conductor's total charge remains zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface +q. So the conductor is like having a shell with inner surface -q, outer +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due
