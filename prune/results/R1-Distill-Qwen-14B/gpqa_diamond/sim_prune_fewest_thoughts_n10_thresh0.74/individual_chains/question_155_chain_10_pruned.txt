Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. Let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. From what I remember, the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the variance, which is the expectation of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation of the operator. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

First, I need to find the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ in the given state. The state is provided as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that down:

ψ = [ -1/2; sqrt(1/2); -1/2 ]? Wait, no, the second element is 1/sqrt(2), right? So ψ is a 3-component vector: first element -1/2, second 1/sqrt(2), third -1/2.

Now, the matrix for P_z is given as:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, P_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state ψ is expressed in that basis. So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I can compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Let's compute ⟨P_z⟩ first. The expectation value is the sum of the components multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, let me think. The state ψ is a column vector [a; b; c], where a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2. The eigenvalues for each component are ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = a * ħ + b * 0 + c * (-ħ) = aħ - cħ.

Plugging in the values:

a = -1/2, c = -1/2.

So, (-1/2)ħ - (-1/2)(-ħ) = (-1/2)ħ - (1/2)ħ = (-1/2 -1/2)ħ = (-1)ħ.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the expectation value is a scalar. Let me compute it again.

Wait, another approach: When you have a diagonal matrix in the basis of its eigenvectors, the expectation value of P_z in state ψ is the sum of |ψ_i|^2 multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalues.

Ah, right! Because in the eigenbasis, each component is the amplitude for that eigenstate. So, the expectation value is the sum over |ψ_i|^2 * E_i, where E_i are the eigenvalues.

So, for each component
