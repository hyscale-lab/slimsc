Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data, and the options are related to propenyl and butenyl acetates. Hmm, I think acetates are esters, right? So they have the structure R-O-CO-R', something like that.

The NMR data given is: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). I need to figure out which structure this corresponds to.

First, let me recall the structures of each option. The options are Cis and Trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates. Propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- or something similar, and butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH2CH2CH=CH- maybe. But wait, the exact structure depends on the position of the double bond.

Wait, acetates would have the ester group. So, propenyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Wait, propenyl is three carbons with a double bond. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. So propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think: The ester would be R-O-CO-R'. If the R is propenyl, which is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. So propenyl is like CH2=CHCH2-O-, but wait, propenyl has three carbons, so maybe it's CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond. Wait, propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, the propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2-O- attached to the acetate.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structures. Let's see.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Propen
