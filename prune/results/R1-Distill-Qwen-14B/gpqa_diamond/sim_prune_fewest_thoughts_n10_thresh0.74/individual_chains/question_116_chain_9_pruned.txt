Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, A undergoes monobromination to form B, which is treated with alcoholic KOH to form C. C has two geometrical isomers, and the cis-isomer reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. We need to identify D from the options given.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let's think about Compound A. The NMR data: two signals. The triplet is at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That sounds like it could be a methyl group attached to something. At 0.9, usually it's a CH3 group, maybe in an ethyl group or adjacent to an oxygen. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups, so perhaps another CH2 group. Wait, but wait, quartet in 1H NMR is when each proton is split by two equivalent neighboring protons, right?

Wait no, the splitting depends on neighboring protons. A quartet (four peaks) would come from coupling with three equivalent protons, because the formula is (n+1), where n is the number of neighboring H. Wait, no, wait: the number of peaks is (n+1), where n is the number of neighboring protons. So quartet means each proton is next to a group with three H's. So, for example, if you have a CH2 adjacent to a CH3, the CH2 would be a quartet because each H in CH2 is next to three H in CH3.

Wait, but the signal for 4H is a quartet. So maybe each H is next to a group with three H. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2 group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 group next to another CH2 group. Wait, if you have a CH2CH2 (like adjacent CH2 groups), each CH2 would be a quartet
