Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

So the setup is: there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque, which affects its orientation. The energy levels are quantized for spin systems. For a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment mu can be either +mu or -mu in the direction of the magnetic field.

Initially, the field is along +Z. So the particle's spin will align with the field. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to Sz, so the energy levels are E = -mu·B. Since mu is gamma Sz, E = -gamma * B * Sz. But wait, Sz has eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for spin 1/2. So the energy levels are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E = gamma B (ħ/2). But wait, actually, the standard formula is E = -mu·B, so if mu is along +Z, then E = -mu_z * B. So when B is along Z, the energies are E = - (gamma Sz) * B.

But when the field is turned off, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the magnetic field is turned off and another one along Y is turned on. So the magnetic field changes direction from Z to Y.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian. So the initial state is an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian (along Z), and after the change, the Hamiltonian becomes along Y.

Hmm, so the system is initially in an eigenstate of Sz. Then the magnetic field changes direction to Y, so the Hamiltonian becomes H = - mu · B, which now is along Y. So H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the Hamiltonian H is proportional to the magnetic moment dotted with the magnetic field. So H = - mu · B, which would be -gamma B (S · direction), where direction is the direction of B.

So initially, B was along Z, so H_initial = -gamma B S_z. Then, after the field is turned off and Y is turned on, H_final = -gamma B S_y.

So the system was in an eigenstate of S_z, say up or down. Now, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. So the energy levels are determined by S_y.

Wait, but S_y has eigenvalues +/- ħ/2. So the energies would be E = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (±1). So eigenvalues are +/- (gamma B ħ/2), but wait, perhaps I should consider the sign
