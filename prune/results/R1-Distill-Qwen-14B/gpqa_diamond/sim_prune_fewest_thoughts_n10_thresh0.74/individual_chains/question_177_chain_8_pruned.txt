Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's see what the given information is.

First, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Interesting, same scaling for radius and mass. But wait, the question is about luminosity, which I think depends more on radius and temperature.

Then, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (their peak wavelengths) are the same. Oh, right, that's from Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. So, since λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point because when calculating luminosity, temperature plays a big role.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since we're assuming they're black bodies, this should apply.

So, if I plug in the values, L1 = 4π(R1)²σT⁴ and L2 = 4π(R2)²σT⁴. Since T is the same for both, when I take the ratio L1/L2, the T terms will cancel out. So the ratio becomes (R1² / R2²).

Wait, because R1 is 1.5 R2, substituting that in: ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / (R2^2 ) = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options don't all have 2.25. Let me check the options again.

The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D)~2.23. So A is 2.25, but wait the problem says to calculate the factor by which L1 is greater than L2, which would be (L1/L2) = 2.25. So the answer would be A) ~2.25.

Wait, but did I miss anything else? Let me see. The problem mentions radial velocities of 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, how does that factor into this?

Oh, wait, because the problem says the masses are 1.5 times each other, but I used only the radii for luminosity. But the radial velocities... maybe that's a red herring or relates to something else?

Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which a star is moving away or towards us. But how does that affect luminosity? Luminosity is an intrinsic property, it's how much light the star emits, regardless of its motion
