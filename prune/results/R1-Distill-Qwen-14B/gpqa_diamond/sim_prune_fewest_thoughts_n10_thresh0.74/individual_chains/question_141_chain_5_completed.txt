Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, maybe that's a typo? Oh wait, no, I think that's 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Because sometimes when writing structures, the numbering can be off. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene? Because 'd' might stand for dinitro. So the molecule has a bromine and two nitro groups attached to the benzene ring.

So, the structure is a benzene ring with bromine at position 1, nitro groups at positions 2 and 4. Wait, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Position 1 is bromine, then positions 2 and 4 would be adjacent and opposite to that? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Yeah, that makes sense. So three substituents: Br at position 1, nitro at 2 and 4.

Now, the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, typically used in deprotonation reactions, especially for aromatic compounds. In such conditions, like in the benzidine rearrangement, or maybe for elimination reactions.

Wait, but when benzene rings have strong electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro groups, they can activate certain positions for nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But wait, NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Or maybe it's involved in deprotonation, leading to elimination.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. If we have a benzene ring with substituents, and we treat it with a strong base, like NaNH2, perhaps it's a case of aromatic ring activation or deprotonation leading to some kind of elimination.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are nitro groups and a bromine. Nitro is a strong meta-directing group. So the positions that are activated for substitution would be the meta positions relative to the nitro groups. But wait, the ring is already substituted with Br at position 1, and nitro at 2 and 4. So the possible positions left are 3,5,6?

Wait, with substituents at 1,2,4, the next available positions are 3,5,6. But wait, the nitro groups are at 2 and 4, so perhaps the positions next to them are activated or deactivated.

Wait, the reaction is NaNH2 in ammonia. I think that's a condition used for dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for aliphatic halides. Alternatively, maybe it's undergoing a Fittig reaction, but that's between aryl halides. Or perhaps it's a case of eliminating HBr, but that requires adjacent H and Br.

Wait a second, another thought. NaNH2 could deprotonate a position on the benzene ring. Once deprotonated, the ring becomes more electron-rich, perhaps allowing for elimination of Br- as a leaving group. But wait, the bromide is a leaving group in elimination? So if the ring is deprotonated, maybe it abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to a double bond formation (elimination) and loss of HBr.

But wait, benzene doesn't have double bonds like alkenes. Oh wait, perhaps it's a case of forming a benzyn intermediate. Benzynes are aryne intermediates, formed by dehydrohalogenation of aryl halides. So, if Br is at position 1, and a proton adjacent is removed, say at position 2, then elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, perhaps, but that's not how benzynes form.

Wait, benzynes are formed when two adjacent positions lose H and Br, leading to a triple bond (or a diradical, but that's more in other contexts). So in our case, the Br is at position 1. Are there adjacent hydrogens that can be abstracted by NaNH2?

Looking at the structure: positions 1 (Br), 2 (NO2), 4 (NO2). Wait, if the Br is at 1, then adjacent positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 has a nitro group, which is meta to position 6. So position 6 is adjacent to Br, but is it possible to abstract a proton from position 6?

Wait, let me draw the structure. Benzene ring with Br at position 1, nitro at 2 and 4. So positions 3,5,6 are open. So position 6 is adjacent to Br. So if NaNH2 abstracts a proton from position 6, then the Br could leave, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? Or wait, that's not possible because 1 and 6 are adjacent. Wait, benzynes are usually formed from adjacent dihalobenzenes, but here we have only one bromine.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of the wrong reaction. Alternatively, maybe the strong base deprotonates a position, making the ring more activated for elimination of Br. If that's the case, the possible positions are 6 or 3,5?

Wait, maybe the benzene ring with substituents could undergo elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that's only possible if two adjacent substituents are present. In this case, the Br is at 1, and another substituent at position 2. So eliminating H from position 2 (but that's nitro, so no H there) or position 6.

Wait, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene. So the nitro groups are at 2 and 4, and Br at 1. So the benzene ring would have Br at 1, NO2 at 2 and 4.

So the positions available for deprotonation would be 3,5,6. Let's see:

- Position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (NO2) and 4 (NO2). So it's between two nitro groups. Deprotonating position 3 would make sense, but would that lead to elimination?

Wait, wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br (position 1), then elimination of HBr could occur, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, leading to a benzene ring with a triple bond (aryne), but that's a very unstable structure.

But wait, in this case, the ring has two nitro groups (strong deactivating) and a Br. So is elimination feasible? Or maybe the base deprotonates a position, making the ring more electron-rich, which could facilitate the substitution of Br with an amide group or something. Wait, but the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is aprotic and maybe provides a source of NH2-.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. In this case, the ring is heavily substituted with nitro groups and a bromine.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. NaNH2 is a very strong base, used for deprotonation. In the case of an aromatic ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups, the base can deprotonate the ring to form an aromatic anion. For example, in the case of phenol, the base can deprotonate to form phenoxide.

So in this compound, which positions are acidic enough to lose a proton? The acidity of the protons on the benzene ring is influenced by the substituents. Nitro groups are strong meta directors and deactivating. The presence of multiple nitro groups would make certain protons more acidic.

In 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene, the positions available for deprotonation are 3,5,6. Let's consider each:

- Position 3: It is adjacent to two nitro groups (positions 2 and 4). That would make the proton at position 3 very acidic, as the nitro groups stabilize the negative charge that would form upon deprotonation.

- Position 5: It is meta to both nitro groups. Wait, no. Let me number the ring again. If Br is at position 1, then the positions are 1, 2 (NO2), 3, 4 (NO2), 5, 6.

So position 3 is between 2 and 4. Position 5 is opposite to position 1 (since 1 is Br, 4 is NO2). Wait, position 5 is between 4 and 6. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to visualize the structure.

Another approach: The nitro groups are at 2 and 4, so the ring looks like this:

Positions: 1 (Br), 2 (NO2), 3, 4 (NO2), 5, 6.

So the ring is symmetric. Let me imagine that positions 3 and 5 are symmetric. Because if you rotate the ring, 3 and 5 are similar. Wait no, because position 3 is adjacent to 2 (NO2) and 4 (NO2), whereas position 5 is adjacent to 4 (NO2) and 6, which is next to Br at 1.

Wait, perhaps position 6 is adjacent to Br at 1, and its proton is more acidic because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the Br? Wait, Br is an ortho/para director, but it's a weaker deactivating group compared to nitro.

So, which positions are more acidic?

Nitro groups are stronger EWG than Br. So, the protons ortho to nitro groups are more acidic. Let's see:

- Position 3: ortho to position 2 (NO2) and position 4 (NO2)
- Position 5: para to position 2 (NO2), and ortho to position 4 (NO2)?
Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the ring is numbered as:

1: Br
2: NO2
3: H
4: NO2
5: H
6: H

Wait, no. The structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene. So positions 1,2,4 have substituents.

So the ring looks like:

Positions 1 (Br), 2 (NO2), 3 (H), 4 (NO2), 5 (H), 6 (H).

So, the adjacent positions to Br (position 1) are 2 and 6. Position 2 is NO2, so no H. Position 6 has H. So can the base abstract the H at position 6?

But wait, the nitro group at position 2 is meta to position 5, and para to position 6. Hmm.

Wait, for aromatic ring protons, the acidity can be influenced by substituents. The presence of strong EWG like NO2 can make the adjacent (ortho) protons more acidic. So, the H at position 3 is ortho to both 2 and 4 (NO2), so it's highly acidic. The H at position 5 is meta to 2 and para to 4 (NO2), so maybe less acidic. The H at position 6 is ortho to Br and para to 2 (NO2).

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about each H:

- H at position 3: ortho to two nitro groups. That should make it very acidic because the nitro groups are strong EWG. Deprotonating here would lead to a negative charge on C3, which is stabilized by the two nitro groups.

- H at position 5: para to NO2 (position 2) and meta to NO2 (position 4). So some acidity, but perhaps less than position 3.

- H at position 6: adjacent (ortho) to Br (position 1) and para to NO2 (position 2). The Br is a deactivating group but not as strong as nitro. So the acidity here would be influenced by both substituents. But nitro is stronger, so maybe position 6's H is more acidic than position 5's.

Wait, but Br is an ortho/para director and deactivating but less so than nitro. So the H at 6 would be more acidic than H at 5, but perhaps less than H at 3.

So the most acidic proton is at position 3, then 6, then 5.

So the base (NaNH2) would likely abstract the proton at position 3 first, as it's the most acidic.

When the H is abstracted, the ring becomes negatively charged at C3. Then, perhaps elimination of Br- occurs, but wait, Br is attached to C1. So is there a possibility of forming a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzynes)?

Wait, benzynes form when two adjacent substituents (like two halogens) are present, leading to the elimination of both and the formation of a triple bond. But in this case, only one Br is present. So perhaps this isn't the case. Alternatively, maybe the deprotonation leads to a substitution reaction.

Wait, another possibility: Once the base deprotonates C3, the ring becomes stabilized with a negative charge. Then, perhaps the Br leaves as Br- (since it's a good leaving group) and a new bond forms, leading to a substitution. But in aromatic substitution, the leaving group is usually in a position that allows for the transition state or intermediates to form.

Wait, but aromatic nucleophilic substitution typically occurs under strongly basic conditions when the ring is activated by strong EWGs. In this case, the ring is already activated by multiple nitro groups. So when the base abstracts a proton, making the ring even more electron-deficient, maybe the Br can leave, and the ring can undergo substitution.

Wait, but the Br is at position 1. If the ring is deprotonated at position 3, the negative charge is on C3. Would that facilitate the Br leaving? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the deprotonation leads to a benzene ring with a nitro group, Br, and a negative charge on C3. Then, perhaps the Br could leave, but that would require a good leaving group in a position where the ring can stabilize the transition state.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products are formed.

If the reaction leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (aryne), that would be one product. But benzynes are highly strained and reactive, so perhaps they rearrange or add something.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation and elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, another approach. NaNH2 is used in the formation of benzynes from aryl halides. The process is called dehydrohalogenation. For benzynes to form, two adjacent substituents (like two halogens) are needed. But in our case, there's only one Br, so that's not possible. So perhaps benzynes aren't formed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But under these conditions, what would the nucleophile be? Ammonia is present, but in the condensed form. In that case, perhaps the Br could be replaced by an amide group.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and in the presence of ammonia, could it act as a base and deprotonate, leading to a substitution of Br by NH2-?

But in aromatic substitution, nucleophilic attack is possible under strongly activating conditions. The nitro groups are deactivating, but perhaps the deprotonation makes the ring more activated at certain positions.

Wait, but if the ring is deprotonated, making it electron-rich at that position, then the Br (a good leaving group) could be replaced by the amide group.

So, substitution of Br with NH2 would give 1-amino-2,4-dinitrobenzene. But wait, would that be possible under these conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is at position 1, and the substitution occurs at position 1, leading to an amino group there. But wait, in nitro-substituted rings, the positions for substitution are usually meta to the nitro groups.

Wait, but if the ring is deprotonated at position 3, which is adjacent to two nitro groups, maybe the substitution occurs at position 3?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Scenario 1: Deprotonation leads to elimination of Br, forming a benzene ring with a triple bond (aryne). But with only one Br, can't form a triple bond between adjacent carbons. So this scenario is unlikely.

Scenario 2: Deprotonation and substitution of Br with NH2. If the Br leaves and ammonia acts as a nucleophile, substituting into position 1, but in aromatic substitution, the nucleophilic attack typically occurs at positions that are activated. Since nitro groups deactivate the ring, but deprotonation can activate certain positions.

Wait, maybe the position where the base abstracted the proton is the site of substitution. So if the H was abstracted from position 3, then the substitution happens at position 3.

But wait, Br is at position 1. So substitution at position 3 would give a 1-bromo-3-nitro group, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Alternatively, the base abstracts a proton, making the ring more electron-rich, and the Br leaves, leading to a benzene diradical or some intermediate that can capture an amide group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't lead to substitution but instead to some kind of ring expansion or contraction. But that's more common in aliphatic systems.

Hmm. Another thought: Perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, where two aryl halides are coupled. But in this case, there's only one Br. So that's probably not it.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products. The question asks how many possible products are formed. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So perhaps the reaction could form more than one product based on where the substitution occurs.

Wait, perhaps the base can deprotonate different positions, leading to different products. For example, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, leading to substitution at a certain position, and another from position 6, leading to substitution elsewhere.

But wait, the substituents are 1 (Br), 2 (NO2), 4 (NO2). So positions 3,5,6 are available for deprotonation.

So, if the base abstracts from position 3, then substitution might occur at position 3, replacing what? If the Br leaves, perhaps the NH2 comes in, but that would require a substitution at position 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is at position 1, and the substitution occurs at position 1, but that's where the Br is. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a bromine being replaced by an amino group. But under what conditions would that happen? In aromatic substitution, for nucleophilic substitution, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack.

In this case, the nitro groups are deactivating, but if the ring is deprotonated, maybe it becomes activated enough for substitution.

Wait, but in the presence of strong nitro groups, the ring's electron density is low, making nucleophilic attack difficult. But deprotonation could create a strong electron-withdrawing effect in a specific position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with an amino group replacing the Br. So 1-amino-2,4-dinitrobenzene would be the product.

But how many products would that be? Just one.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene. If the Br is replaced by NH2, that would be one product. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from a different position, leading to a different substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the base could deprotonate at position 5 as well. If the H at position 5 is abstracted, would that lead to substitution at position 5?

But position 5 is para to position 2 (NO2) and meta to position 4 (NO2). So if substitution occurs there, it would be 5-nitro... but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract protons from multiple positions, leading to multiple substitution products.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible regiochemistry. If the Br is replaced by NH2, where would that occur? In aromatic substitution, the incoming group typically goes to the position that's most activated. But the nitro groups are strong deactivating, so perhaps the substitution can't happen. Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation makes a specific position more activated.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possibility of two different substitution products. For example, substitution at position 3 and substitution at position 5.

But wait, the nitro groups are at 2 and 4. So substitution at 3 would be adjacent to both nitro groups, making it a meta position relative to each. Substitution at 5 would be para to one nitro and meta to another.

But I'm not sure how that affects the reactivity. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates position 3, leading to substitution at position 3, and deprotonates position 5, leading to substitution at 5, giving two products.

But wait, with the starting material having two nitro groups, the substitution product would be 3-amino-1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene and 5-amino-1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, leading to substitution at position 6. So substitution at 3,5,6. Thus, three possible substitution products. But then, would that lead to three products?

Wait, but the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in ammonia. I'm not sure if all three positions are equally reactive. Maybe only certain positions are acidic enough.

Wait, the nitro groups are in positions 2 and 4, which are adjacent. So the ring has high symmetry? Wait, no. Because the Br is at position 1, while the nitro groups are at 2 and 4. So the molecule is symmetric along the axis passing through position 1 and 4. So positions 3 and 5 are mirror images of each other, so they would have the same acidity. Position 6 is unique.

So, in this case, deprotonation can occur at position 3 and 5 (which are equivalent) or at position 6. So, total two distinct positions for deprotonation.

If substitution occurs at each deprotonation site, perhaps that leads to two products.

Wait, the products would be:

1. Substitution at position 3 and 5 (but since they are equivalent, same product).
2. Substitution at position 6.

Wait, no, substitution would occur where the proton is abstracted, which is position 3 or 6. But wait, substitution replaces the Br, which is at position 1. So substitution at position 1 would replace Br with NH2. But how does deprotonation at position 3 lead to substitution at position 1?

Hmm, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe substitution happens at the position where the proton was abstracted. So if the H is abstracted from position 3, substitution occurs at 3, replacing H with NH2. But wait, Br is at position 1. So substitution would be at position 3, leading to 3-amino-1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene.

Similarly, if the H is abstracted from position 6, substitution would occur at 6, giving 6-amino-1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene.

But wait, would substitution occur at position 3 or 6 in this scenario?

Alternatively, perhaps substitution occurs at position 1, replacing Br with NH2. That would give 1-amino-2,4-dinitrobenzene.

So, if substitution can occur either at position 1 (direct substitution of Br), or at positions 3 and 6, leading to different products.

Wait, but how many substitution products are possible?

If substitution can occur at position 1, that's one product. If it can also occur at 3 and 6, but 3 and 6 are different, that would be two more products, making a total of three.

But wait, I'm not sure if substitution can occur at positions 3 or 6. It depends on whether the ring is activated there.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs only at position 1, leading to one product. Or perhaps substitution can occur at position 3 and position 6, which are distinct, leading to two products.

Wait, but the nitro groups are in positions 2 and 4, which are para to each other. So the molecule is symmetric along the axis through positions 1 and 4. Therefore, position 3 and 5 are symmetric, so substituting at 3 or 5 would lead to the same product because they're mirror images. The position 6 is unique, so substitution there would give a different product.

So, if substitution occurs at 3 (or 5, same product) and at 6, that would be two products. Plus substitution at position 1 would be another.

Wait, but substitution at position 1 would mean replacing Br with NH2, which would be 1-amino-2,4-dinitrobenzene.

So, possible products:

1. 1-amino-2,4-dinitrobenzene (substitution at 1)
2. 3-amino-1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene (substitution at 3)
3. 6-amino-1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene (substitution at 6)

But wait, NaNH2 is a base. If substitution occurs, it's likely that the Br is replaced by something else. Wait, but in the reaction, the Br would act as a leaving group. So if substitution occurs at position 1, then the product would have an amino group there and no Br. So that's one product.

If substitution occurs at position 3, then the Br would be replaced by NH2, but wait, the Br is at position 1. So substitution at position 3 would require the Br to leave, but that's at position 1. Hmm, perhaps substitution at position 3 would require the Br to exit from position 1, but that doesn't make sense because position 3 isn't adjacent to Br.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the substitution isn't at the position where the proton was abstracted, but rather the Br is replaced by NH2, regardless of the position.

Wait, perhaps the substitution is at position 1, so the Br is replaced by NH2. That would give one product.

Alternatively, if elimination occurs, forming a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that would be a single product as well.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible number of products.

If the reaction leads to substitution at position 1 (Br replaced by NH2), that's one product.

If deprotonation leads to elimination of Br and formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (aryne), which then might add ammonia in different positions, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but via some rearrangement.

Wait, another angle: the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Under strong basic conditions, perhaps the Br is replaced by NH2. So the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dinitrobenzene. But how many products would that be? Only one.

But wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3 and position 6, leading to different substitution, but that would require substitution at those positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution leads to more than one product. For example, the Br could be replaced by NH2 in either position 1, 3, or 6, but that doesn't make sense because Br is only at position 1.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider that NaNH2 in ammonia is a condition for dehydrohalogenation to form benzynes. For benzynes to form, two adjacent leaving groups are needed. But in this case, only one Br is present. So perhaps this reaction doesn't form a benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with an amino group in substitution for Br. So one product.

But the options include options up to 4. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different substitution products, depending on where the deprotonation occurs. For example, deprotonation at position 3 and 6, leading to substitution at those positions, replacing Br with NH2.

Wait, but substitution would require the Br to leave from position 1. So if the substitution occurs at position 3, the Br would have to be eliminated from position 1, but that would require a mechanism that allows for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br leaves, and the NH2 group substitutes at position 1, leading to one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then undergoes elimination of Br, forming a carbene or some other structure. But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed through substitution but through elimination. If the Br is eliminated, forming a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But position 2 has a nitro group, which can't have a proton adjacent to Br. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs between positions 1 and 6, which are adjacent. So if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then elimination of HBr occurs, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. That would create a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6, making it a benzene diradical or aryne.

But benzynes are highly strained, so perhaps they can undergo further reactions. But under these conditions, perhaps the aryne is formed and then reacts with ammonia or another nucleophile.

Wait, but if the aryne is formed, it can react with ammonia to add NH2 groups. Arynes can undergo [2+2] additions or other cycloadditions, but I'm not sure in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the aryne could add across the triple bond, leading to different products.

Wait, so the benzene ring would have a triple bond between 1 and 6. Then, when it adds ammonia, perhaps it would add across that triple bond, leading to different regiochemistry.

But I'm not sure about the specifics. Alternatively, perhaps the aryne is unstable and doesn't form, so the reaction doesn't proceed that way.

Hmm. Considering the time I'm taking, perhaps I should think about the answer options.

The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction leads to substitution of Br with NH2, that's one product. If deprotonation leads to two different positions, leading to two substitution products, that would be two.

But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to three products: substitution at position 1, 3, and 6.

But since positions 3 and 5 are symmetric, substitution at 3 and 5 would lead to the same product. So substitution at 3 and 5 is the same, and substitution at 6 is another. Plus substitution at 1, that's three products.

But I'm not sure if substitution can occur at position 1. Because if the Br is at position 1, and the base abstracts a proton somewhere else, would the Br leave and NH2 come in at position 1?

Alternatively, perhaps substitution only occurs at position 1, leading to one product.

But that's just a guess.

Wait, another thought: The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the Br is eliminated, and an amino group is added in a different position. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where the Br is replaced by NH2. But for that to happen, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which typically requires strong EWG. Since we have two nitro groups, that should activate the ring in certain positions.

The possible positions for substitution in nucleophilic aromatic substitution are typically meta to the EWG. So in this case, the nitro groups are at 2 and 4, so the possible sites for substitution would be at positions 5 and 3.

Wait, no. For nucleophilic substitution, the substituent would typically attack positions that are meta to the EWG. So position 5 is meta to the nitro at 2, and position 3 is meta to the nitro at 4.

Wait, maybe substitution can occur at both positions 3 and 5, leading to two products.

But wait, the Br is at position 1. So substitution would have to occur at position 3 or 5, replacing what? Wait, no, the Br isn't at 3 or 5.

Wait, perhaps the Br is replaced by NH2, so substitution occurs at position 1, giving one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, leading to substitution at position 3, and the Br leaves, leading to another product.

But that's getting complicated.

I think I'm going in circles here. Based on what I can gather, the reaction likely leads to the substitution of Br with NH2, giving one product. So the answer would be option B) 1.

But wait, another possibility: the base could abstract a proton from position 3, leading to substitution at position 3, and from position 6, leading to substitution at position 6, but substitution at position 1 would be another product. So three products.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two substitution products: substitution at position 1 and substitution at position 3 (and 5, which is the same as 3).

So, two products.

Alternatively, considering the symmetry, substitution at 3 and 5 are the same, substitution at 6 is different, and substitution at 1 is another, leading to three products.

But without a clear understanding, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps I should look for similar reactions. 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene treated with strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia would likely undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.

Then, perhaps the benzene diradical (aryne) can react with ammonia. Arynes can undergo cycloadditions, but perhaps in this case, it would just form a new compound.

Wait, the aryne would have a triple bond, and perhaps when it reacts with ammonia, it would add NH2 groups across the triple bond in different positions.

But in a benzene ring, adding across the triple bond would lead to substitution on adjacent carbons. So for a triple bond between 1 and 6, adding NH2 would lead to substitution at positions 1 and 6.

Wait, but the triple bond is between 1 and 6. So adding NH2 would require two positions to be substituted, but that would need a di-substitution.

Alternatively, the aryne could add ammonia in a way that leads to substitution at one position, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the aryne is a reactive intermediate that could lead to various products, but I'm not familiar with the exact outcomes in this scenario.

Given the time I've spent and the uncertainty, I'll make a educated guess. I think the reaction leads to substitution of Br by NH2, giving one product. So the answer is option B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and nitro groups at positions 2 and 4. The reaction conditions suggest a strong base (NaNH₂) and a potential nucleophile (ammonia). The key steps and considerations are as follows:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene, with substituents at positions 1 (Br), 2 (NO₂), and 4 (NO₂). The remaining positions (3, 5, and 6) are available for reaction.

2. **Role of NaNH₂**:  
   NaNH₂ is a strong base that can deprotonate acidic hydrogens on the aromatic ring. The nitro groups (NO₂) are strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), making certain protons on the ring highly acidic. Specifically:
   - Position 3 is ortho to both nitro groups (positions 2 and 4), making it the most acidic.
   - Position 6 is adjacent to the bromine (position 1) and para to the nitro group at position 2, making it less acidic than position 3 but still reactive.
   - Position 5 is less acidic due to its position relative to the substituents.

3. **Possible Reactions**:  
   - **Deprotonation and Substitution**: The base can abstract a proton from position 3 or 6, leading to a negatively charged intermediate. This could facilitate the substitution of the bromine atom at position 1 with an amino group (NH₂) from ammonia.  
   - **Formation of Aryne Intermediate**: Another possibility is the elimination of HBr, forming a benzene ring with a triple bond (aryne) between positions 1 and 6. Arynes are highly reactive, but the question focuses on the number of organic products, not further reactions of the aryne.

4. **Symmetry and Products**:  
   The molecule has symmetry along the axis passing through positions 1 and 4. Positions 3 and 5 are equivalent due to this symmetry. Therefore:
   - Substitution at position 3 and 5 leads to the same product.  
   - Substitution at position 6 leads to a distinct product.  
   - Substitution at position 1 (replacing Br with NH₂) is another possible outcome.

5. **Number of Possible Products**:  
   - Substitution at position 1: 1-amino-2,4-dinitrobenzene.  
   - Substitution at position 3/5: 3-amino-1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene (same as 5-amino-1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene due to symmetry).  
   - Substitution at position 6: 6-amino-1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene.  

Thus, there are three distinct organic products.
