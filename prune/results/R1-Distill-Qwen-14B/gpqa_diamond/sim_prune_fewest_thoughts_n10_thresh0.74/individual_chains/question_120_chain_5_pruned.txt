Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through it.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. So, that probably means the same number of stars per unit volume in all directions. Wait, uniform distribution in space, not on the celestial sphere, right? Because the celestial sphere is just the apparent positions in the sky, but the actual distribution in space would be more about their distances from us.

Parallax, plx, is the angle subtended by the distance to the star. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. So a star at 10 parsecs has a plx of 0.1 arcseconds, etc.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, like, if I fix a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume would be uniform, but the way they are spread out in terms of parallax depends on their distances. Since plx is inversely related to distance, the distribution in plx space isn't uniform.

Let me think about the volume. The number of stars in a certain volume depends on the distance. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. So, the number of stars per unit volume (n) is constant.

But we're looking at a range
