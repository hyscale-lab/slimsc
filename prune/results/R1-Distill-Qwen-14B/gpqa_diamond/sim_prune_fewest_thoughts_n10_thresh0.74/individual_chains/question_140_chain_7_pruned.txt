Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the question thoroughly.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's try to piece this together.

First, I need to figure out what X and Y might be. The reaction is violent, which makes me think of something like a strong acid reacting with a carbonate or maybe a metal reacting with an acid. But wait, gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, that's important. So the molecule of W has equal neutrons and protons. Let me think about common gases.

Which gases have equal numbers of protons and neutrons in their molecules? Well, the most obvious one is CO2, but wait, that's a triatomic molecule. Let me count: carbon has 6 protons and, assuming the most common isotope, 6 neutrons (C-12). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So each CO2 molecule has (6+8+8) protons (22) and (6+8+8) neutrons (22). But wait, the gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons, but the question says the molecule contains the same. So maybe W is CO2? Because 22 protons and 22 neutrons. But wait, the molecule itself isn't necessarily the same as an atom, but each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, another possibility is H2O. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (assuming H-1). O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So H2O would have 2*(1) +8 = 10 protons, and 2
