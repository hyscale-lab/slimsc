Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my interplanar distances, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see... The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral, right. So, a rhombohedral crystal system is one where all the lattice parameters are equal, a = b = c, and all the angles are equal, alpha = beta = gamma. In this case, the angles are 30 degrees each. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distanceâ€”oh, that's the distance between two adjacent atoms in the lattice, right? So that would be the lattice constant a, since in a cubic system, a is the edge length. But wait, rhombohedral isn't cubic, but in this case, since all the angles are 30 degrees, it's a more compressed structure.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) ), but wait, is that right? Wait, no, I think I might be mixing some terms here. Let's think again.

Wait, no, the general formula for the interplan
