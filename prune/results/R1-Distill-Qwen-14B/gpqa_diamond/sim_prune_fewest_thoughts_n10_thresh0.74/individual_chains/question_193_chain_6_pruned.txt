Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's read it again.

The question says that astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, but wait, actually, parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1 / d, where d is in parsecs. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases, right.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, then plx^5 would be (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5. So taking the reciprocal, 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question isn't directly about N as a function of d. It's about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so maybe I need to think about the number of stars per unit distance, like the density or something.

Wait, the number of stars in a region would depend on the
