Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, let's read through the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem describes a series of reactions. Let's break them down one by one.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8 for A:B. So the reaction might be something like A + 8B → C. 

Next, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. So the reaction is C + 2D → E. 

Then, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is strong and G is weak, F could be something like HCl (strong) and G might be something like H2SO3 (which is weak) or another weak acid.

Looking at the other reaction, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H. Since H is a solvent, maybe something common like water or ethanol, but more likely something like HCl or another polar aprotic solvent? Wait, or maybe D is something that forms a common solvent when reacted with B. Hmm.

Let me try to piece this together. Maybe I should think about possible compounds for A, B, C, D, etc.

Looking at the first reaction: A + 8B → C (bright red). Bright red product makes me think of something like copper(II) compounds, which are often red or blue. Alternatively, maybe a metal sulfide, but sulfides are usually not red. Wait, another possibility: maybe a transition metal oxide. For example, CuO is black, but some other metal oxide might be red. Or perhaps the product is a sulfide? Or maybe it's a compound like FeS, but that's usually black.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a halogen. If A is, say, a metal and B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would suggest something like FeCl4? No, FeCl3 is more common. Wait, let's think about the reaction with water. C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. So if C is a metal chloride, reacting with water could produce HCl (a
