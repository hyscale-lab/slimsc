Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the eigenvector of an operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when measured in that direction.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know. The operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given in the problem. The overall operator P would be the vector sum of these components in the direction of n. Since n lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as a vector with x and z components, but no y component. So let me think, n would be in the form (n_x, 0, n_z), right?

Wait, but for a unit vector, the magnitude would be 1, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. But maybe I don't need to get into the specifics of n_x and n_z since the problem is about the eigenvector along this arbitrary direction. Hmm, but how do I construct the operator P in the direction of n?

Oh right, the operator for the component along n would be P · n. So that would be P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator becomes P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but each component P_x, P_y, P_z is an operator matrix. So I'll need to construct the matrix for P · n by combining the given matrices for each component, scaled by n_x and n_z respectively.

Wait, but the eigenvector is for the operator P along n, so the eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So I need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, wait, wait. Each P component is already multiplied by ħ/2. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh yes, P_x is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix with first row [0,1
