Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I need to understand the basics. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES are spectrographs used for observing stars. The question provides some key information about their brightness detection limits.

ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait. No, correction: the text says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me check again. Oh, right, it says "brighter than 17 mag"â€”so that means stars with V magnitude less than 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter (smaller mag), ESPRESSO can see it.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V magnitude less than 16 can be detected by HIRES.

So each spectrograph has a limit: ESPRESSO can go up to 17, HIRES up to 16. Any star with V <17 can be seen by ESPRESSO; any with V <16 can be seen by HIRES.

But wait, the question is asking which stars can be detected by both? Because the question is which stars are observable by both instruments. So a star must be bright enough to be seen by both. So the star's V magnitude must be less than the lower of the two limits. Because if a star's V is, say, 16.5, then it's above HIRES's limit (which is 16), so HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <17. So for a star to be detected by both, its V must be less than 16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16.

Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So if a star is, say, V=16, then both can see it. But if it's V=16.5, then HIRES can't see it, but
