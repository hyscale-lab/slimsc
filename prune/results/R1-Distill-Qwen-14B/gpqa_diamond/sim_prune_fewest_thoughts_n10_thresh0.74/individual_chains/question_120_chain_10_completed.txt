Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d), like p = 1/d or something like that. But wait, I think it's more precise to say that p (in parsecs) is equal to 1/d where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/p.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait, so it's like N per unit plx. Let's think in terms of volume. If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (stars per volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So for a given range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there?

Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, a small change in parallax corresponds to a change in distance. Let me clarify this. If plx increases, the distance decreases. So for a small range of plx, say plx to plx + dplx, what does this mean for the distance?

Parallax is p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So if p increases by dplx, then d changes. Let me compute the change in d. Let's take differentials. dp = dplx (since plx is p). Then, since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p^2) dp. So dd = - (1/p^2) dplx. But wait, when p increases, d decreases. So for a small change in p, the change in d is proportional to 1/p².

Wait, but how does this relate to the number of stars? The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density of stars. Volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars would be n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density.

But the question is about how many stars are there per unit plx. So we need to express everything in terms of plx (p). Since d = 1/p, we can substitute that in.

So number of stars N in a shell at distance d is proportional to d² dd. Substituting d = 1/p, we get:

d² = (1/p)^2 = 1/p²
dd = - (1/p²) dplx (from earlier)

But since we're considering a small range, maybe taking the absolute value, so d = 1/p, then dd = (1/p²) dplx.

Wait, no, because if p increases, d decreases. So a change in p (dplx) would result in a change in d of (1/p²) dplx. But wait, since p is increasing, d is decreasing. So the thickness in d is positive when p is increasing? I think I'm getting confused with the signs, but perhaps I can ignore the sign for the purpose of the magnitude.

So the number of stars N in the range p to p+dp is proportional to (d)^2 * (dd). So substituting, d = 1/p, so d^2 = 1/p². And dd = (1/p²) dp.

So N ∝ (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but wait. Let me go through that again. The volume element is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars is proportional to d² dd. Since we're looking for stars per unit range of parallax, we have to express this in terms of p.

So N = k * d² * dd, where k is the number density.

But d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p².

And dd is the change in d for a change in p. So, as p increases by dp, d decreases by (1/p²) dp. So dd = - (1/p²) dp. But when considering the number of stars, the change in d is positive in the direction of increasing d as p decreases, so perhaps I should take the magnitude, so dd = (1/p²) dp.

So N = k * (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. So N = k * (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm mixing up the variables. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the number per unit parallax interval. So the number of stars in a thin shell between p and p+dp is proportional to 4π d² * dd, which is 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp. So that would be proportional to (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit parallax dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, the options are about how it changes with plx. So the number per unit range of plx (so per dp) would be ~ 1/p^4. So as plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but that's for a thin shell. So the number of stars per unit range of plx would be proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/p^4, D is ~1/p^3. So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, another approach: Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a volume between distance d and d+dd is n * 4π d² dd. But d = 1/p, so dd in terms of p is 1/(p^2) dp.

Wait, no. Let's correct that: When p increases by dp, d decreases. So, to express dd in terms of dp: p = 1/d => dp = - (1/d^2) dd => dd = - d^2 dp. So, substituting d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p^2) dp.

So the number of stars in the range p to p + dp is n * 4π d² dd. Substituting d =1/p and dd = -(1/p^2) dp.

This becomes n * 4π (1/p^2) * (-1/p^2) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but we're interested in the magnitude. So the number N is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Hence, N is proportional to (1/p^4) dp, which means the number per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). For a thin shell at distance \( d \), the number of stars is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), multiplied by the number density of stars \( n \). Thus, the number of stars in a shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is:

\[
N \propto d^2 dd.
\]

Since \( d = 1/p \), we substitute \( d^2 = 1/p^2 \) and \( dd \). To express \( dd \) in terms of \( p \), we take the differential of \( d = 1/p \), yielding \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting \( d^2 \) and \( dd \) into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{p^2} \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). Therefore, as parallax \( p \) increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).

From the given options:
- **A) ~ 1/plx^4**: This matches the derived result.
- **B) ~ 1/plx^2**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^2 \).
- **C) ~ 1/plx^1**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p \).
- **D) ~ 1/plx^3**: Incorrect, as the dependence is \( 1/p^4 \), not \( 1/p^3 \).

The correct answer is **A**.
