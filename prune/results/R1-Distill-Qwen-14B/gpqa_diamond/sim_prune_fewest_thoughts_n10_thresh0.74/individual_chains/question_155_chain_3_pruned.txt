Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z, given that the system is in a particular state which is an eigenstate of P_x.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is found using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I'll need to compute the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x, so when you measure P_x, you'll definitely get the corresponding eigenvalue. But for P_z, since the state is not an eigenstate of P_z, the expectation value would be a bit more involved.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's call this vector |ψ⟩. So |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The operator P_z is given as a matrix. Let me write that down. P_z matrix is:
First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ħ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements ħ, 0, -ħ.

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that means the states |e1⟩, |e2⟩, |e3⟩ correspond to the eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

So, the state |ψ⟩ can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors. Wait, because the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, right? So each component of |ψ⟩ is the amplitude in each eigenstate of P_z.

But wait, in this problem, the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z already. So the components of |ψ⟩ are the coefficients when you express |ψ⟩ in terms of |e1⟩, |e2⟩, |e3⟩.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can take the inner product of |ψ
