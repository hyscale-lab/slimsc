Okay, so I have this question about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. But wait, what exactly is regularization? Oh right, it's a way to make the calculations finite by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method, and then you take the limit where that cutoff goes away. 

The question is asking which theory doesn't need regularization. So, I need to go through each option and see which one doesn't have these divergences or doesn't require such a process.

Option A is Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. Strings are tiny vibrating objects, right? I remember that in string theory, the concept of a point particle is replaced with a string, which might help avoid some of the usual infinities. Also, string theory is supposed to be a background-independent theory, which I think means it doesn't rely on a fixed spacetime background like some other theories do. But wait, do they need regularization? I think in string theory, because it's a theory that inherently includes gravity, and perhaps because the string framework itself regularizes the problems. Like, perturbative string theory might use methods that don't require the same kind of divergent regularization as say, QFT does. Or maybe because it's a theory that doesn't have the same renormalization issues? Or perhaps it's because it's a higher-dimensional theory, so some divergences are absent.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to quantum Yang-Mills. Wait, but doesn't QCD require renormalization? For example, beta functions in QCD show that the coupling becomes weaker at higher energies (asymptotic freedom). But renormalization is part of regularization; you regularize first then renormalize. So QCD definitely requires regularization because calculations without it would have divergences. So B is not the correct answer.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, and it's a well-understood quantum field theory. I remember that QED requires renormalization because of issues like the electron's self-energy
