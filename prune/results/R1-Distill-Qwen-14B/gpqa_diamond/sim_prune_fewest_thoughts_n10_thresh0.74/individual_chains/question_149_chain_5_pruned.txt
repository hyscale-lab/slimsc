Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR shows some anomalies. There are two peaks for the same alpha-proton, similar shifts and equal integralsâ€”so together they add up to 1H. Also, the coupling isn't the reason because they ruled that out. Then, the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. What's going on?

Alright, let's break this down. The NMR has two peaks for an alpha proton. Normally, each alpha proton (like on an amino acid residue) should be a single peak. But why two? The integrals are each 1H, so together it's 2H? Wait, no, the total for both is 1H. Wait, the question says they integrate to 1H together. So each peak is about half a proton? Or wait, maybe it's two peaks each integrating to 0.5H, adding up to 1H. That makes sense because it's the same proton. But why two peaks?

Coupling to other protons usually gives splitting, but the question says coupling isn't the cause. So maybe it's not spin-spin but something else. Oh, maybe it's diastereotopic protons. Diastereotopic protons are equivalent in some environments but not others. Wait, but in that case, they might split into two peaks. But in that situation, each would be an equivalent proton, so maybe their shifts are the same. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's some kind of epimerization happening. If the compound can exist in two diastereomeric forms, then each form would have its own alpha proton environment. But wait, diastereomers would have different physical properties and would show up as separate peaks in LC-MS. But the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. Same mass suggests they are either enantiomers or diastereomers with the same formula. Wait, no, diastereomers have same formula but different structures, so same mass. So if the LC shows two peaks, same mass, that could be diastereomers. But wait, enantiomers also have same mass. But enantiomers would not be separated by LC unless the column is ch
