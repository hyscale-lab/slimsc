Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's see. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the star is far away, and if plx is large, the star is nearby. So plx = 1/distance, right? Or was it distance in parsecs? Oh yeah, I think the formula is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So distance r is 1/plx.

But wait, in the question, the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5. So number is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, number N = k * (1/( (1/r) )^5 ) = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. That would mean as distance increases, the number increases with the fifth power.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if you have a small change in distance, say dr, how does the number of stars change? Oh wait, no—the way the question is phrased, it's about the number per unit range of distance. Hmm, maybe that's different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The number of stars in a region with a certain parallax—so the relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So when you're looking at a larger distance, you have more stars. But wait, that doesn't make sense because more distant stars are fainter, so you should see fewer, right? Oh wait, the way the question is phrased, perhaps it's a specific region, so maybe all stars in that region are at similar distances? Or maybe it's a density consideration.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit distance would be dN/dr. Let's compute that derivative.

So N = k * r^5. The derivative dN/dr is 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) increases with r^4. Wait, but the question is about the change in number with distance per unit range. So, maybe the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr, which would be proportional to r^5 * 4πr² dr (like a volume element). Wait, no, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of stars per volume. Oh wait, in 3D space, the number of stars in a volume would depend on the density and the volume. But the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which translates to N ∝ r^5. But that seems high; perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's go back. The number of stars is given as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. So, for a given region, as you go to higher distances, the number of stars you count goes up as r^5. That's a steep increase.

But how does this translate to the change with distance? The question says, how does the number change per unit range of distance. So, maybe they're asking about the differential change in N with respect to r. That is, dN/dr. So from N = k r^5, dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

But wait, looking at the options: option B is r^5, option C is r^4. So if the question is about the number of stars in a region per unit distance, then it's r^4. But wait, the question says 'the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)'. Hmm. So perhaps for each unit increase in r, how does the number N change? If N is proportional to r^5, then for each unit r, the change would be proportional to r^4. So the number per unit distance would be r^4.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think of it another way. Suppose you have a region of the sky, and you want to know how many stars are in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr. The number of stars would be the surface density multiplied by the area of the shell. Wait, no, wait: parallax depends on the distance, so for a given parallax, the number of stars observed would relate to the density at that distance.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider that the number of stars in the direction of a certain parallax (so a certain distance) is given by N ∝ 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, N = k r^5.

But wait, that would mean as r increases, N increases as r^5. So the number of stars in that region increases rapidly with distance. But that's counterintuitive because more distant stars are fainter and should be less numerous. Hmm, maybe the question is assuming that all stars in that region are at a particular distance, so the number of stars is increasing because the volume is larger? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the setup is that in this region, the number of stars you observe with a given parallax is 1/plx^5. So for lower parallax (higher distance), you're seeing more stars.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a key concept. The number of stars in a specific region (like a small patch of the sky) as a function of distance. So, for a given line of sight, the number of stars you can see depends on their absolute brightness and distance. But the way the question is phrased, it's about the number varying as 1/plx^5, which is given.

So, parallax plx is 1/r. So N = k (1/plx)^5 = k r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. So for each unit increase in r, the number increases as r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps it's the differential, which would be dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4.

But the options are about how the number changes with distance, meaning the dependence of N on r. The options are about the functional form of N as a function of r.

Wait, the question says: 'how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)'. So per unit range of r, like delta r, how much does the number change. So the rate of change, dN/dr, which is proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the number N is proportional to r^5, but the rate of change (per unit distance) is proportional to r^4.

So the answer would be option C, which is r^4.

Wait, but let me check the logic again. The number of stars in a region varies as 1/plx^5. Because plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So N = k r^5.

So for each unit increase in r, N increases by 5k r^4. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer is C, ~r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases with \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).

Answer: C
