Okay, so I need to compare the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think about what each of these terms means.

First, the paramagnetic coupling term. I remember that paramagnetism arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by the Bohr magneton μ_B multiplied by the magnetic quantum number m. The energy associated with this interaction is the Zeeman term, which is something like H = -μ·B. Since B is parallel to Oz, the term simplifies because the angle between μ and B is zero, so cos(0) is 1. So the energy would be proportional to m*B.

But wait, what's the magnitude of the magnetic field here? It's given as B=1 Tesla. The Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.274×10^-24 J/T. So the energy for the paramagnetic term would be something like H = μ_B * m * B. What's m? Oh, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and the question says it's small. So m could be 0, ±1, maybe ±2. But since it's small, let's take m=1 for calculation purposes.

So plugging in the numbers: H = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J. Hmm, but wait, I should check if m is the total magnetic quantum number or just the orbital part. Oh, for hydrogen, the magnetic quantum number m can be -1, 0, +1 (since the orbital angular momentum l is 0 for s, 1 for p, etc. But in this case, the question is about the paramagnetic coupling, which I think is the spin-orbit coupling? Wait, no. Paramagnetism usually involves the spin magnetic moment. Oh, right, paramagnetic effect comes from the spin, so the magnetic moment is μ = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. Oh, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify.

The paramagnetic term is the Zeeman effect due to the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment (spin) and the external magnetic field. The energy is H = -μ·B. The spin magnetic moment μ is μ = (μ_B) * m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number, which can be ±1/2. Oh wait, but wait, in that case, m would be 1/2. So H would be (μ_B * m_s) * B. So for m_s = 1/2, H = 9.274e-24 J/T * 0.5 * 1 T = 4.637e-24 J.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is given for the hydrogen atom with a wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. Let me calculate ΔE using the energy of a photon. The energy E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.
