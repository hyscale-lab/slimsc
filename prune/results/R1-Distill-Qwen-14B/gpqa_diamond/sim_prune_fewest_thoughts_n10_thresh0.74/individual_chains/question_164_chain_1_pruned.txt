Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? The question is about figuring out which system is more massive and by what factor. 

Alright, let me read the problem again. So, there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. So, system_1 has a longer period than system_2.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass considered is the sum of both stars in each system.

Hmm, I remember that in binary stars, the velocity amplitude is related to the mass. Oh right, the more massive star has a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. So the mass is inversely proportional to velocity. But wait, how do the velocities relate to the masses?

I think the formula involves the mass ratio. Let's denote the masses as M1 and M2 for each system. The velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So, for a binary system, M1/M2 = v2/v1, where v1 and v2 are the velocity amplitudes of the two stars. Because the more massive object moves slower.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the center of mass requires M1 * v1 = M2 * v2 (since momentum is conserved). So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So for system_1: the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let me call them v1a and v1b. So for system_1, the mass ratio M1a/M1b = v1b / v1a = 5/10 = 1/2. So M1a is half of M1b. That means the more massive star is M1b, because it has the smaller velocity.

Similarly, for system_2: velocities are 15 and 10 km/s, so M2a/M2b = 10/15 = 2/3. So M2a is two-thirds of M2b, meaning M2b is more massive.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The more massive star has a lower velocity. So in system_1, the star with 5 km/s is more massive than the one with 10. So M1 more massive is 5's star, so M1b is larger.

Wait, but we need to find the total mass of each system. So for each system, the total mass is M1_total = M1a + M1b. And for system_2, M2_total = M2a + M2b.

But how do we find the actual masses? Because the velocities are given, but without knowing the actual distance or other factors, I think we can only find the mass ratios within each system, and then relate the systems based on their periods.

Hmm, wait, the orbital period is the same for both stars in a binary system. So, system_1 has a period P1=2 years, system_2 has P2=1 year.

I remember Kepler's third law for binary systems. The formula is (M1a + M1b) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a^3, where a is the separation between the stars. But I think another version relates the sum of the masses to the velocities and the period.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the mass function comes into play here, but I'm a bit hazy on that.

Wait, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion and the orbital period. The formula is K = (2
