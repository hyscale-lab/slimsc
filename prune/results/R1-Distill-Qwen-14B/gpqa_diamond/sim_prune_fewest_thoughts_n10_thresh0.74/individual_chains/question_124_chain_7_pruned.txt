Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about particles being collided in a detector, and their Lorentz factor. I remember Lorentz factors are related to special relativity, particularly when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light.

So the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and these are fast-decaying particles that move at ultra-relativistic velocities. The average Lorentz factor here is about 20. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. 

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

I think I should model this scenario. Let's think about what determines how far a particle travels before decaying. The particles are produced at the center, so they have to travel outward to the inner wall, which is 30 meters away. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall depends on its speed, right? But because they're moving at relativistic speeds, time dilation might come into play.

Wait, the problem mentions that one third of the particles reach the inner walls when the Lorentz factor is 20. So, I guess I need to find out how the Lorentz factor affects the fraction of particles that make it to the wall. The idea here is that particles with a higher Lorentz factor will live longer, so more of them will reach the detector walls. Because in the first case, lower gamma, only one third reach, but we want two-thirds to reach, so we need a higher gamma.

Wait, no. Wait, higher gamma would mean longer lifetime from the lab frame. So if a particle's lifetime from our perspective is longer, it can travel further. So, if a particle's lifetime is longer, it has a higher chance of reaching the wall before decaying.

But wait, the problem states that at gamma ~20, on average, one third reach. So, for two-thirds to reach, we need a gamma that's higher than 20. So, looking at the options, the possible answers are higher than 20. Options are A:54, B:68, C:40, D:28. So among these, options A, B, C are higher than 20. So the answer is among C, A, B, or D. Well, D is 28, which is higher than 20, but lower than the others.

So I need to model this. Let me think about the proper time of the particle. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. From our lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So the time available for the particle to travel is T, and in that time, it can only reach the wall if gamma*tau is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.

Wait, but the particle is created at the center, so the maximum distance it can go
