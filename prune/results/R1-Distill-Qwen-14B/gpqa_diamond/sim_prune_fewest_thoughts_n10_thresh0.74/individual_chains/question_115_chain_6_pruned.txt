Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, I need to find the angle between the two photons. Let me think about what I know.

First, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are measured. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, so both particles are moving along the x-axis, but in opposite directions. The electron is moving left to right (from the left), and the positron is moving right to left (from the right). So their velocities are opposite in direction.

When they annihilate, they produce two photons. Since they're annihilating, their rest mass energy is converted into the energy of the photons. But the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So each photon gets 511 keV, since an electron and positron each have rest mass energy of about 511 keV, so together it's 1022 keV, split equally.

But wait, the question says the energies of both photons are the same. So each photon has energy 511 keV? That makes sense because energy and momentum must be conserved.

Now, I need to think about conservation of momentum and energy. The initial momentum of the electron and positron must equal the total momentum of the two photons.

Let's get into the details. The electron has a Lorentz factor gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2. Since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, maybe I should assign opposite signs to their momenta.

The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m * v. Or in natural units, p = gamma * m * beta, since beta is v/c.

Wait, but for energy, the total energy is gamma * m * c². So for each particle, I can compute their energies and momenta.

Let me calculate the momentum and energy of each before the collision.

For the electron moving from left (let's say positive x direction) with gamma_e=4:

Energy_e = gamma_e * m_e * c² = 4 m_e c
