Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the information given is the Mass Spec, IR, and 1H NMR. Let's start with each part.

Mass Spec: Molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%), and a peak at m/z 158 (32%). So molecular weight is likely 156. The m/z 158 suggests something with an additional oxygen maybe? Or perhaps a chlorine isotope. Wait, chlorine has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and 25% for 37Cl. So if the molecular ion is at 156, and there's a peak at 158, which is 2 mass units higher, that might correspond to the presence of chlorine. Let me calculate. If the molecular weight is 156, and the chlorine contributes 35 or 37, then maybe the molecular formula includes Cl.

IR: Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad in that region probably indicates an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, a broad peak could also be an N-H stretch, but I don't think that's the case here. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong peak, which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. But wait, the 1720 is a bit lower than typical for an aldehyde (which is usually higher, like 1720 might be more like a ketone or ester). Alternatively, maybe a carboxylic acid would have a strong peak around that area, but wait, carboxylic acids usually have O-H stretches too. Hmm.

1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a very deshielded proton. In aromatic compounds, that could suggest an aldehyde proton. Or maybe an -OH in a carboxylic acid. Wait, wait, in carboxylic acids, the -OH protons are usually broad around 10-12 ppm, but sometimes split into a singlet if it's exchanging. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde proton, that would be a strong deshielded singlet. Let me think, another possibility is an acidic proton like in phenol, but that would be around 5-7 ppm, I think. So 11.0 is more likely an aldehyde or carboxylic acid.

Then, looking at the rest of the NMR: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are doublets. So that suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split into doublets. The downfield shifts around 8 ppm suggest electron-withdrawing groups. So maybe substituents like chloro or carbonyl groups.

Putting this together: Let's think about the possible structures. The options are:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

Let me analyze each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with hydroxyl group at position 2 and Cl at position 3. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0. So that could fit. The hydroxyl group as an -OH would be a broad peak around 5 ppm, but in this molecule, the hydroxyl is at position 2. Wait, if it's a benzaldehyde, the aldehyde is at position 1. So positions 2 and 3 have OH and Cl. But wait, the NMR doesn't show a broad peak around 5 ppm. The only peaks are at 11, 8.02, and 7.72. Oh, wait, the 11ppm is a singlet, perhaps the aldehyde. Then where is the OH? Maybe in the IR, the broad peak is from the OH. So IR shows a broad peak, which could be the -OH of the phenol. But wait, the IR also has a strong peak at 1720, which would correspond
