Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate a single pole. So that's probably why the equations are different there.

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me recall them. The four equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and relate to each other and charges and currents.

In our universe, the first equation is Gauss's law for electricity: the divergence of E is proportional to the charge density. The second is Gauss's law for magnetism: the divergence of B is zero. Then there's Faraday's law of induction, which is about the curl of E, and Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, which is about the curl of B.

So the four equations are:
1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t)

Now, in the given scenario, magnets can have isolated poles. That would mean that the divergence of B isn't zero anymore. Because in our universe, ∇·B = 0 comes from the fact that there are no magnetic monopoles. If in this universe there are monopoles, then the divergence of B would be something else—like proportional to the magnetic charge density.

Which equation would that affect? Let me think. The second equation, ∇·B = 0, would change. So equation 2 would be different.

But the question also says that Maxwell's equations look different. Are there other equations that might change? Well, in our equations, the third equation is Faraday's law. If there are magnetic monopoles, would that affect Faraday's law? Hmm, I'm not sure. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, another thought. In our equations, the time derivative of B contributes to the E field in Faraday's law. If there are magnetic charges, would there be a corresponding term for the E field's time derivative contributing to the B field? I think that if magnetic monopoles exist, then the curl of E would not just depend on the time derivative of B, but maybe also on the current or something else. Or perhaps the fourth equation, Ampère's law, would also change because it relates the curl of B to the current and the time derivative of E.

Wait, but Ampère's law already includes the displacement current, which is ε₀ ∂E/∂t. That was added by Maxwell to fix the inconsistency in Ampère's original law. So if there are magnetic monopoles, maybe the other equations (like the one for the curl of B) would pick up additional terms.

Alternatively, I remember that in the presence of magnetic charges, Maxwell's equations are modified in two places. Specifically, the divergence of B is no longer zero, and the curl of E (Faraday's law) also gets an extra term.

Wait, let me think again. In our universe, ∇·B = 0 because there's no magnetic charge. If in this universe, there are magnetic charges, then equation 2 would become ∇·
