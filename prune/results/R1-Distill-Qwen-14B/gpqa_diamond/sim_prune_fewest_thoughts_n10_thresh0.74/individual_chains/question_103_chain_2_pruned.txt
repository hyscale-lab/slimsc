Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a series of steps.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, ethan-1-one means a two-carbon chain with a ketone group on the first carbon. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, and position 5 has a nitro group. Attached to that benzene is a ketone group (from ethan-1-one), which would be a methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and on the ring is attached a carbonyl group. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is a ketone where the carbonyl is at the end of a two-carbon chain. So the structure would have a benzene ring with substituents, and a ketone group attached via a single bond. So the benzene is at the end of a (propanone?) No, wait. 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one. So the structure is a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O), which is connected to another carbon (CH3). So it's (Ph)C(O)CH3, but the phenyl has substituents at 3 and 5 positions: Br and NO2.

So the target molecule is a ketone where the benzene ring has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5. So the substituents are meta to each other? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 3 and 5 are adjacent if the ring is numbered correctly. Wait, no. Let me think: if the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, that's two substituents,
