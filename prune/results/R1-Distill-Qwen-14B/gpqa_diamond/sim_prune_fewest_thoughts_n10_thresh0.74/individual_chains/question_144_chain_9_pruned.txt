Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are particles made of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles, right? They don't exist for very long before decaying.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance depends on how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer it lives, the farther it can travel. So the lifetime must be related to the decay width. Oh right, the decay width Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime τ. So τ is equal to ħ/(Γ), right? But wait, I think the formula is τ = ħ/(Γ), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

But wait, wait. The decay width Γ is given in MeV. I need to convert that into energy units that can be used with Planck's constant. I remember that Planck's constant ħ has units of energy multiplied by time, or alternatively, since energy is mass times c squared, but perhaps it's easier to handle in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. But I'm not sure, I need to think.

Alternatively, I can use the relation between the mean proper lifetime τ and the total decay width Γ. The formula I remember is τ = ħ / Γ. So first, I'll need to compute τ.

But wait, what about the energy? Because the problem gives the production energy, but the mass is given. Oh, wait, the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the production energy is higher than the mass energy. Hmm, but for the decay, I think the energy of the particle affects the decay length.

Wait, the mean decay distance (L) would be the velocity (v) multiplied by the lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

So first, I need to find τ, then find v, and then multiply them together.

But let's take it step by step.

First, calculate the lifetime τ. Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ.

I need to convert ħ into units that include GeV and inverse seconds or something. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, yeah, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 s.

Yes, so 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, no, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is the same as (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 /
