Hmm, okay, I have this question about nuclear physics and approximations used in calculations. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking which assumptions jointly imply the "impulse" approximation. So I need to understand what the impulse approximation entails. From my notes, I remember that the impulse approximation is a simplification where the nucleons in the nucleus behave as if they're free. That probably means that their interactions are treated as if they're individual, independent particles, not considering much about the nucleus as a whole.

The question lists four assumptions, and I need to pick which three make this approximation happen. Let me go through each option.

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So this means that the force or interaction doesn't involve multiple nucleons at once. It's like each nucleon is treated separately, which aligns with the idea of free particles because they're not considering collective effects.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Hmm, I'm trying to think about what this means. Transparent probably implies that other nucleons don't affect the interaction much. So when a particle (like a photon or a pion) interacts with the nucleus, it only interacts with one nucleon, and the rest are just along for the ride, not influencing the interaction. That makes sense because if other nucleons didn't matter, each interaction is just with one, making it similar to a free nucleon in a vacuum.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, quarks are part of the nucleon. If they're non-relativistic, that means their motion isn't at speeds close to light. So their behavior is classical or more like everyday matter, which might be easier to model. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, if quarks are non-relativistic, the nucleon's structure is treated more simply. But I'm not sure if this directly contributes to the impulse approximation. Maybe it's about treating the nucleon as a point particle without considering internal dynamics, but wait, the question is about the interaction with external forces.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, right! Binding forces are the nuclear forces holding the nucleons together. If we ignore them during the interaction, each nucleon is treated as if it's free, moving without being influenced by others. So the approximation would neglect the fact that
