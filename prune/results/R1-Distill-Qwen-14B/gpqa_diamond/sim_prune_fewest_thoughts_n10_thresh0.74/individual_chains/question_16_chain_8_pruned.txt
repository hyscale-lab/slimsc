Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm. I remember that optical activity is related to having chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. So each compound in the question needs to be checked for whether it has any chiral centers or maybe some other form of asymmetry that allows it to be optically active.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but the double bond's geometry is Z. But wait, can a double bond lead to optical activity? I think double bonds can cause geometric isomerism, but optical activity comes from chirality, which requires a chiral center. So, looking at the structure, is there any carbon with four different groups attached? Let's see: The molecule is but-1-ene, so the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the numbering is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So C1 has Cl, double bond to C2, and two single bonds. Wait, C1 has Cl, a double bond (so two C=C), and two CH2 groups? No, wait, butene-1 means double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl, and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with the double bond. Wait, no, but it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let
