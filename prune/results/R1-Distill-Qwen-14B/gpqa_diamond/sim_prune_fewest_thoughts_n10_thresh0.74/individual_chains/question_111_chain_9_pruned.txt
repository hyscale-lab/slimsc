Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. I'll start with the first reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong base, so maybe it's inducing some kind of elimination or addition reaction. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an ester with an acrylate group, which is a good Michael acceptor. Oh right, Michael addition! So this might be a conjugate addition.

The starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group. Wait, no, wait: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So, position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group attached. So, two substituents on C2, and another methyl on C6. The numbering is such that the ketone is at C1, so positions 2 and 6 are adjacent.

In a cyclohexanone, the ketone is at C1. So the ring has substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl). Now, when reacting with ethyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOEt, in a Michael addition, the enolate would attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone. So maybe it's forming an enolate. The base, t-BuOK, would deprotonate the alpha position. Which alpha position? The starting ketone is at C1. The alpha carbons are C2 and perhaps C6? But wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the carbonyl is at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. The substituents on C2 are ethyl and methyl.

So, the possible alpha protons are
