Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, a supernova happened, and part of the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in their own inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, wait, so the time given is from the ejecta's frame. So I think we need to relate the time in the Galaxy's frame to the ejecta's frame because their velocities are different, so time dilation might come into play here. Oh right, because when objects are moving relative to each other, their time measurements can differ according to special relativity.

Let me think about the setup. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center. From the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at that speed. So the speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but the problem says both are inertial frames, so we can use special relativity here. The key here is to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during a certain time. But the time is given in the ejecta's frame, so we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame.

Right, so the time experienced in each frame is different due to time dilation. The time in the ejecta's frame (t') is 50 seconds. We need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, which would require knowing the time elapsed there, t.

The formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, what's the velocity here? It's 60,000 km/s. Let me calculate v in terms of c.

First, speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v = 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. Because 60,000 is 20% of 300,000. So v = 0.2c.

So gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me compute that. Sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98, but let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.980 (since 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is close to 0.96). So gamma is approximately 1/0.98 ≈ 1.0204. But maybe I should compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, let me compute 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute 0.96: square root is 0.9798 approximately. So 1/0.9798 is about 1.0203. So gamma is about 1.0203. So t = gamma * t' = 1.0203 * 50 ≈ 51.015 seconds.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in the ejecta frame, the time is t', and the Galaxy's frame is moving relative to the ejecta. So when the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer for events happening in the direction of motion. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer.

But wait, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, so from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching. So the Galaxy's frame would see the ejecta moving towards it at v.
