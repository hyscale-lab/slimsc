Okay, so I've got this question about black hole entropy, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem states that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's located at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy. The options are A to D, all in powers of ten with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically the area of the event horizon. The formula I recall is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. So the entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon.

Wait, but the question gives me the angular size θ. So I need to find the radius of the event horizon first. Oh right, because the angular size relates the actual size (radius) of the event horizon to the distance it's observed from.

The formula for angular size is θ ≈ (radius) / (distance), where θ is in radians. But since θ is given in degrees, I'll need to convert it to radians first. I remember that 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180).

So, let me calculate that. θ is 1e-17 degrees, so θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me compute that roughly. π is about 3.1416. So 3.1416 / 180 is approximately 0.01745 radians per degree. So 1e-17 degrees would be 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, but that's a very small angle, which makes sense because the black hole is very far away, so the event horizon's apparent size is tiny.

So, the radius r is approximately distance d multiplied by θ_rad. So r = d * θ_rad.

But wait, the distance d is given as 1e10 parsecs. I need to convert parsecs into meters because I think all the constants like G, c, ħ are in SI units.

1 parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m. Let me compute that: 1e10 * 3.0857e16 = 3.0857e26 meters.

So d = 3.0857e26 m.

Now, multiply d by θ_rad to get r:

r = d * θ_rad ≈ 3.0857e26 m * 1.745
