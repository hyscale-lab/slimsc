Okay, let's see. So, I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M. They give stability constants for the different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually tell us how stable a complex is, right? So the higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. From what I remember, the blue one is probably the Co(SCN)_n^m+ complex with a certain number of ligands. I think the dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ions, so maybe Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that.

Wait, the complexes are numbered from 1 to 4, each with different β values. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So CoSCN^+ (n=1), Co(SCN)_2^(2+), Co(SCN)_3^(3+), and Co(SCN)_4^(4+) perhaps? Because each higher n adds another SCN-.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's interesting because β3 is the highest here. So the complex with three SCN^- ions is the most stable.

But the question is specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which would be the n=2 complex, I think. Because I remember that the color of the complex depends on the number of ligands. Like, for Co, the hexaaquo is pink, but with thiocyanate, the color changes. The blue one is probably the tetrathiocyanato, but wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. No, wait. I think Co(SCN)_4^2- is the one that's blue, but wait, that's a different charge. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively
