Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

We have an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so maybe we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. They're either fixed or constrained.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. So they're all on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So the 13th is at the center, and the 12 are equally spaced on the surface, I guess.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, since it's an isolated system, the energy must be the potential energy because there's no other form mentioned.

Wait, but wait. So, each charge is 2e. So the potential energy in a system of charges is calculated by considering each pair of charges and the potential energy between them. Oh right, the formula is U = k * (q1 q2) / r. But since all the charges are the same, this might simplify.

So the system is isolated, so we have to calculate the total electrostatic potential energy of all the pairs. But how?

Let me think. There are 13 charges. So the 13th is at P, and the other 12 are fixed at 2m away from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2m away from the 13th charge.

Wait, but each of the 12 is also 2m from P, but what about their distances from each other? Since they're all on a sphere of radius 2m, each pair of the 12 charges is separated by some distance greater than 2m. But wait, are all 12 charges identical and placed symmetrically? Like, equally spaced on the sphere? So, their mutual distances would vary, but since the system is symmetric, maybe we can compute the average or something. But wait, maybe the problem expects us to consider only the potential between the 13th charge and the 12 charges, and ignore the potential between the 12 charges themselves. But that doesn't make sense because the total potential energy includes all pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the
