Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm. The question is about finding the probability that a measurement of a certain observable yields 0. I've studied some of this before, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll have to think carefully.

Alright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait. In quantum mechanics, the state vector should be a unit vector, right? Because the probabilities have to add up to 1. Let me check. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The length squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. Oh, so it's not normalized. So the actual state vector would be this divided by the square root of 6. So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. That makes sense.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Wait, let me write that down.

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Hmm. I need to find the probability of measuring 0 when I measure this observable. Oh wait, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, another approach: if I can diagonalize P, then the eigenvalues would be the possible outcomes. Then, the probability of each outcome is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

Let me try to compute the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the equation det(P - Î»I) = 0.

So let's compute the
