Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, let's think about the structure. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, meaning there are two substituents attached. Wait, but wait, the ring itself is 6-membered, so it's an aromatic ring, like benzene. But the total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. So each substituent is probably a single carbon group, but wait, wait, di-substituted means two substituents, each could be one carbon or maybe one is two. Let me think.

Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. So that's a C=O. And it also shows an aromatic-halogen bond, which would indicate a halogen attached to the ringâ€”like Cl, Br, I, etc. So, the substituents must be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait another thing. The total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. So each substituent could be one carbon, but wait, a halogen is an atom, not a carbon. Oh! So one substituent is a halogen (like Cl), which doesn't add any carbons, and the other substituent has two carbons. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group which is O, but that's not a carbon. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me clarify. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene, with two substituents. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6, so substituents contribute 2 carbons. So the substituents must sum to 2 carbons. But one substituent is a halogen (like Cl), which doesn't add any carbons. So the other substituent must be a group that has two carbons. So perhaps it's a ketone, like a carbonyl group attached to a methyl group. Wait, but a ketone would be R-C
