Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I think it's a hydrocarbon with some double bonds. Let me try to visualize the structure.

Wait, wait. The formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So, each end has a (CH3)2C=CH group. The middle parts are CH2 and CH(CH3). Maybe it's a conjugated diene or something like that. But I don't think the structure is super crucial for the calculation; more about the bonds.

The question gives me some bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. Oh, and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element and turn it into atoms. For carbon, that's probably the bond energy of C-C in graphite or diamond. Oh wait, but here it's given as 1000 kJ/mol. So maybe that's the energy per mole to break a C-C bond.

Wait, but for enthalpy of formation, I need to calculate the energy change when the compound is formed from its elements. The formation reaction is usually from elements in their standard states. So let's think: the elements are H2 and C (as graphite or diamond, probably). 

The formula of the compound is, let's count the carbons and hydrogens. Let me see. Each (CH3)2C=CH group has 3 CH3 groups, but wait, (CH3)2C=CH: that's two CH3 attached to a C, which is double-bonded to CH. So each of those groups has two CH3 (so 2*3=6 H), then a C that's double bonded to another CH. So each group is C3H5? Wait, (CH3)2C=CH is
