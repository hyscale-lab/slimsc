Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that causes it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's break down the problem. The molecule is diatomic, made of atoms X and Y. The given data includes their masses: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. Bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh right, I think that's also called the non-rigid rotor model, which accounts for both rotation and vibration. But wait, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, while the non-rigid one allows for some stretching. But I'm not sure if that affects this particular calculation.

In the quantum model, energy levels are quantized. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next higher energy level. But wait, what's the order of energy levels for rotation and vibration?

Vibration is like the stretching of the bond, so it's a harmonic oscillator. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The ground state is v=0, so the next state would be v=1, but wait, that's a higher energy state. But the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in a rotational state and then a photon is absorbed to change it to the next state. Or maybe it's a combination of rotation and vibration. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the next state would be the next higher energy state. But in molecules, energy levels are usually a combination of rotational and vibrational states. So, the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is E_rot = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So, perhaps the molecule is initially in the (v=0, J=0) state. The next state with the lowest energy would be (v=0, J=1), since increasing J by 1 would be the next higher rotational state. Alternatively, if the photon is responsible for a vibrational transition, then perhaps it's going from v=0 to v=1. But which transition requires less energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are higher in spacing than rotational. Because for a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are spaced by h w, while rotational levels have spacing of about (ħ²)/(2I) per step. So, the spacing between J and J+1 is proportional to (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1)
