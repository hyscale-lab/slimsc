Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. 

Wait, so the field is radial, which means it only has a component in the r direction, right? So in spherical coordinates, the vector field would be f(r) = (f_r, 0, 0), where f_r is the radial component. Since it's given that the magnitude is 1/r², that means f_r = 1/r², and the other components (the angular ones, theta and phi) are zero.

The problem is asking for the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of a sphere of radius R. So mathematically, that's ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV, where the integral is over the volume of the sphere.

I remember from my notes that there's something called the divergence theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. The divergence theorem states that ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where the surface integral is over the boundary of the volume. In this case, the boundary is the sphere of radius R.

But wait, maybe I should compute the divergence first and then integrate. Let's try that approach.

So, in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field is given by (1/(r²)) * d(r² f_r) / dr + (1/(r sinθ)) * d(f_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) * (1/φ) d(f_φ)/dφ. Oh, but since the field is only radial, f_θ and f_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies a lot.

So, divergence ∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Let's plug in f_r = 1/r². Then, r² * f_r = r² * (1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, the divergence is zero? Hmm, but that would mean the integral is zero. But wait, I might be making a mistake here.
