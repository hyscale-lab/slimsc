Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene in a methanol solution. It's stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. Then after one equivalent of hydrogen is used up, product 1 is isolated as the major product. 

Alright, first reaction. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, right? It's a bicyclic monoterpene, actually, with a specific structure. I remember that limonene has a structure that includes a double bond. So when hydrogenation happens, the double bonds would be hydrogenated.

Wait, (R)-Limonene is a chiral molecule. Its structure has a specific configuration. Let me think: limonene has a structure where there's a cyclohexene ring with a substituent, like a methyl group and perhaps others. When it's hydrogenated, the double bond would be saturated. So product 1 is the hydrogenated form of limonene. 

Hydrogenation of Limonene. Since the starting material is (R) configuration, the product after hydrogenation would retain some stereochemistry. Wait, hydrogenation of a double bond typically adds two hydrogens across the double bond. Since Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, hydrogenation would turn the double bond into a single bond, making it more saturated. So product 1 is probably the hydrogenated limonene, which I think is called carvone? Or maybe it's menthofuran? Wait, no, I think hydrogenation of limonene gives a different structure.

Wait, limonene's structure is a bicyclic compound, so hydrogenating it would add H2 across the double bond. So the product would have a single bond where the double bond was. So the structure would change from a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond to one without. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening? No, probably not. So maybe it's just the hydrogenated limonene, which is a diastereomer of the starting material.

Wait, the structure of limonene is (R)-5-methyl-2-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexanone. No, maybe I'm mixing that up. Wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a structure of a bicyclic system. Let me get that right. Oh, right, limonene is (R)-5-methyl-2-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexanone. Oh wait, maybe not. Wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, it's actually a cyclic monoterpene with a specific arrangement. So when hydrogenated, the double bond converts to a single bond, leading to a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that hydrogenation would lead to a diol? No, no, the catalyst is Pd/C and H2, so it's a hydrogenation reaction, not an addition of water. So it's adding H2 across the double bond.

So hydrogenation of limonene would lead to the hydrogenated limonene, which has a single bond where the double bond was. Let's say the starting structure has a (E) or (Z) configuration. Since the starting
