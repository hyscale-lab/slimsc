Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the value of 'a' in the wave function. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, so that's the wave function ψ(x). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. Oh right, the most important thing is that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But wait, the problem says that when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Oh, but wait, the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's interesting. So it's a complex function because of the 'i' term. So the absolute square would involve the real and imaginary parts.

Wait, but the wave function must be normalized. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should be equal to 1.

Let me write down ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ is a function of x. The absolute square is |ψ|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you have a complex number like (
