Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) plus a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². I need to find the kinetic energies of the two products. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of MeV values.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they're nearly massless. Oh right, in particle physics, when a pion at rest decays, the muon and neutrino share the energy. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum must be conserved, which implies that the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But neutrinos are treated as massless in such calculations because their mass is negligible compared to other particles. Or wait, do I need to consider their mass? Probably not, since the problem states the muon's mass and the pion's, but neutrino's isn't given, so I'll treat it as massless.

So the process is Pi at rest → mu + nu. Let's model this. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the energies are the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so its energy E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). The neutrino's energy E_nu = p_nu c, since it's massless.

Because momentum is conserved, p_mu = p_nu (since they're opposite in direction). So p_mu = p_nu. Let's denote this momentum as p.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) + p c.

Set this equal to the initial energy: sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) + p c = m_pi c².

Divide both sides by c² to simplify units, maybe. Let's set c=1 for simplicity in these energy terms, so equation becomes:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

So substituting the numbers: m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

Let me write the equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

I can let x = p, then the equation becomes sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

Hmm, how to solve for x. Let's subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x².

So,

x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x².

Cancel x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x.

Bring terms involving x to one side:

2*139.6 x = 139.6² - 105.7².

Compute the right side. Let's calculate 139.6² and 105.7².

139.6²: Let me compute
