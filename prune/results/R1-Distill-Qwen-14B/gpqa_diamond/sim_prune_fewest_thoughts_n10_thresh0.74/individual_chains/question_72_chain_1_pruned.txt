Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's go through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from a bicyclic compound and ending up with a product 4, and we need to find how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

First, let me parse the starting material and each reaction step.

The first compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that the bicyclo notation [x.y.z] refers to the number of carbons in each bridge. So [2.2.1] would mean two, two, and one bridges. Drawing this might help. The structure is norbornene, I think. Wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. So the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's a diene.

At position 7, there's a tert-butoxy group. So the structure would be norbornadiene with a tert-butoxy substituent at one position. I need to figure out which position that is. In norbornadiene, the numbering is such that the double bonds are between 1-2 and 4-5, perhaps? Wait, no, maybe I should visualize the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene has two rings: one bridge of two carbons, another of two, and the third of one. The positions are arranged so that the substituents are on the bridgehead or adjacent positions.

Anyway, the first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile and a good leaving group source. The other reagent is a diene with two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6.

Hmm. This sounds like a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the starting material is a diene (norbornadiene derivative) and the other compound is a dienophile? Wait, no, wait. 5,
