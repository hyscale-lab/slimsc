Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about phosphate buffer solutions and calculating ion concentrations. Hmm, let me read through the question carefully.

Alright, the problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, which probably means we can use standard conditions for the Ka values provided.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. The options are given, but I need to figure out how to calculate it.

So, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The species present depend on the dissociation steps, which are governed by the Ka values. The given Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12 respectively.

Wait, but when dealing with buffers, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is super useful. Since the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are adjacent in the phosphate buffer system, this is a buffer solution. So, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Right, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, in this context, which species are the acid and the base? Let me think. KH2PO4 dissociates to H2PO4^- and K+, while Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2-. So, H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base because HPO4^2- can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The acid is H2PO4^- because it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). So in the buffer, H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base) are present. So their ratio will determine the pH.

But the problem isn't directly asking for pH, but the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Hmm, PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-, so it's the next step. Wait, but how does that fit into the buffer system here?

Wait a minute, maybe I should think about the phosphate equilibria. Let me outline the dissociation steps:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (
