Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is involved. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis typically involves the redistribution of alkene groups. It's a transition metal-catalyzed process where alkenes undergo scission and recombination. So, I think it's a process where the double bonds break and reform in different ways.

So the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a 3-methyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait no, the pent-1-ene has five carbons. Let me count: carbon 1 is double-bonded to carbon 2. Then carbon 3 has a methyl group. So actually, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the methyl on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. Adding a methyl group on carbon 3 would make it C6H12? Wait, no. Wait, wait no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the main chain is five carbons with a double bond from 1 to 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would make the main chain five carbons, but the substituent is on the third carbon.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the main chain is pent, so five carbons. The double bond is between 1
