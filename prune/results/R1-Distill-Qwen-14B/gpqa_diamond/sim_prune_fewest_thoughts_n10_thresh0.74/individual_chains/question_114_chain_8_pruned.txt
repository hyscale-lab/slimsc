Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion (CN-) adds to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, ketones typically form cyanohydrins when reacted with CN- in a basic condition. Oh right, but for that, the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions too.

Wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the ketone butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. The product is a cyanohydrin. The structure would have both a hydroxyl group and a cyanide group attached to the same carbon. So the reaction is forming a cyanohydrin from the ketone.

Under what conditions does that happen? Oh right, acidic conditions. So for the first reaction, the reagent A should be H3O+ (which is the conjugate acid, providing H+). So the reaction is acid-catalyzed, protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then CN- adds. Then water attacks the carbonyl oxygen, leading to the formation of the diol (with OH and CN groups).

So for part A, the reagent is H3O+.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a nitrile group attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group and some benzyl group. The product is the corresponding carboxylic acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, nitrile to carboxylic acid. How does that happen? I think you typically hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. One common method is hydrolysis with strong acid and heat. Or maybe using a strong acid like HCl, with water. Alternatively, sometimes you might use a base, but that usually gives a different product, like an ammonium salt.

Wait, wait. So the nitrile group is converting to a carboxylic acid. The hydroxyl group is still present in the molecule, so the conditions shouldn't remove that.

The reagent B is used along with H2O. So looking at the options, the possible reagents are HCl, CH3COOH, NaHSO3, etc.

Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually requires strong acidic conditions. So using HCl (a strong acid) and water would likely be the way to go. Or maybe another strong acid like H2SO
