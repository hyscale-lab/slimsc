Okay, so I've got this question here about quorum-sensing peptides and some experiments done on yeast. Hmm, I need to figure out which protein complex won't be observed much in their assay. Let's break it down.

So the setup: A new quorum-sensing peptide was found in Lactobacillus acidophilus. They treated yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with this peptide and saw the formation of a shmoo. Now, they're looking into the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry.

The question is asking which complex's proteins will be least present in their assay. The options are A to D, each a different protein complex.

First, I need to recall what a shmoo is. From what I remember, a shmoo is a structure formed in yeast cells under certain conditions, like when they're induced to mate. It's like a projection that helps the yeast cells communicate for mating. So the formation of a shmoo probably relates to the yeast's response to some signaling, maybe similar to quorum sensing in bacteria.

Next, the experiment is about active chromatin in the shmoo. Active chromatin is typically associated with transcriptionally active regions. Proteins that bind to active chromatin might include histones (in nucleosomes), transcription factors, and various complexes involved in initiating or regulating transcription.

The method used is ChIP followed by mass spectrometry. ChIP is used to find DNA-associated proteins. So they're probably looking for proteins that are bound to the chromatin in the regions that are active in the shmoo.

Now, the options:

A) Nucleosome histone complex - Nucleosomes are the basic units of chromatin, made of histone proteins and DNA. Since active chromatin is still nucleosomal (though maybe more open), I expect histone complexes to be present. So this might be a high abundance, so not the least.

B) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC) - This complex is involved in DNA replication. The pre-RC assembles during the G1 phase to mark origins of replication for the initiation of replication in S phase. But if the cells are in a mating response (shmoo formation), are they actively replicating DNA? I'm not sure. Shmoo formation is more about mating and perhaps cell polarization, not necessarily S phase. Maybe the pre-RC isn't active here, so proteins from this complex might not show up much.

C) Pre-initiation complex (PIC) - This is necessary for the initiation of transcription. The PIC includes RNA polymerase II, along with various transcription factors. If the active chromatin regions are being transcribed, the PIC would be present. So we'd expect these proteins to be abundant in the assay.

D) Enhancer protein complex - Enhancers are regions of DNA that help increase the transcription of genes. Proteins bound to enhancers, like certain transcription factors, would be present in active chromatin. So these proteins would be part of the proteome being analyzed.

So the question is which complex's proteins are least likely to be found. If the cells are in a mating response (shmoo), maybe they're not in a phase where DNA replication is active. So the pre-replication complex (option B) might not be present. The other complexes (nucleosome, pre-initiation, enhancer) would all relate to transcription or chromatin structure during gene expression, which is probably happening in the shmoo.

Therefore, the least observed would be the pre-replication complex. So the answer should be B.


The question involves identifying which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the proteome of active chromatin in yeast cells forming a shmoo after treatment with a quorum-sensing peptide. A shmoo is a structure associated with yeast mating and intercellular communication, suggesting the cells are responding to signaling rather than undergoing DNA replication. The experiment uses chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry to analyze proteins bound to active chromatin regions.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A) Nucleosome histone complex**: Nucleosomes are fundamental components of chromatin and are present in active chromatin. These proteins are expected to be abundant in the assay.
- **B) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC)**: This complex is involved in DNA replication and assembles during the G1 phase. Since shmoo formation is associated with mating and cell polarization, DNA replication is unlikely to be active. Proteins from this complex are expected to be absent or scarce in the assay.
- **C) Pre-initiation complex (PIC)**: The PIC is essential for transcription initiation and includes RNA polymerase II and transcription factors. Active chromatin regions are transcriptionally active, so these proteins are expected to be present.
- **D) Enhancer protein complex**: Enhancers regulate transcription by binding specific proteins, such as transcription factors. Proteins from this complex are likely to be present in active chromatin.

Given that the shmoo formation is associated with mating rather than DNA replication, the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) is the least likely to be observed in the assay.

**Answer: B**
