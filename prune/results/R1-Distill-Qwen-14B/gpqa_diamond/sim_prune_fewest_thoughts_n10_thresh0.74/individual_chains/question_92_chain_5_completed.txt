Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let's try to think through this step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me draw its structure mentally. It looks like a chain with some double bonds and substituents. Oh wait, actually, looking closer, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something? Well, maybe the exact structure isn't crucial for the calculation.

The question gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is breaking all bonds in an atom to make it into individual atoms. So for carbon, that would be the energy needed to break all the bonds in a molecule to get C atoms. But wait, how does that tie into enthalpy of formation?

Enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for a hydrocarbon like this, it's the energy change when the compound is formed from carbon (in graphite maybe) and hydrogen gas.

The formula I remember for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

But wait, wait. Let me be precise. The formation reaction is elements combining to form the compound. So the reactants here are C (graphite) and H2. The product is the given hydrocarbon.

Wait no, actually, the bond energies given are for the bonds broken and formed. So for the reaction, we calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when the bonds form in the product.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the enthalpy of the molecule based on the bonds present. The enthalpy of formation can be thought of as the energy required to assemble the molecule from its constituent atoms, minus the energy from the bonds formed.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. Enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formula:

ΔHf = [sum (atoms) of bond energies] - [sum (molecule) of bond energies]

Wait, no, that's not right. The bond energies given are for the bonds in the reactants (elements) and the bonds in the product.

Alternatively, another formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds formed in products)

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formation reaction. The reaction is:

n C (graphite) + m H2 → product

The enthalpy change is the sum of the energies needed to break the bonds in the reactants minus the sum of the energies released when the bonds form in the product.

So for the reactants, C and H2: breaking C-C bonds (but wait, in graphite, each C is bonded to multiple others. Hmm, but I don't think we have C-C bonds in the reactant, because C is in its elemental form as graphite, which is a network of C-C bonds, each shared among multiple atoms. But wait, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of the substance to produce its constituent atoms. So for graphite, the enthalpy of atomization would be the energy to break all C-C bonds to form C atoms.

Wait, but the question gives the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. So for the reaction, each mole of C in the reactant requires 1000 kJ to break into atoms. But wait, no, because in the formation reaction, the C is being taken from graphite, which is already in a certain state, so perhaps the approach is to consider the energy needed to break all bonds in the reactants and then form all bonds in the product.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the concept of enthalpy of formation from the elements. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the energy change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

In this case, the compound is made of C and H. So the reaction is:

a C (graphite) + b H2 (g) → 1 mol of the compound.

The enthalpy change for this reaction can be calculated by considering the bonds broken and formed.

The formula to calculate ΔHf is:

ΔHf = [ (a × bond energy of C in graphite) + (b × bond energy of H2) ) ] - [ (number of each bond in the compound × their bond energies) ]

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let's think in terms of the bond energies provided.

Given:
- Enthalpy of atomization (ΔA) of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. So, this is the energy required to break all bonds in carbon (graphite) to produce C atoms. So for 1 mole of C, the atomization would require 1000 kJ.

But in the formation reaction, we're starting from C (graphite) and H2, so we need to break the bonds in these to form the compound.

Wait, the bond energies provided are for specific bonds: C-C, C=C, C-H, H-H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to model it.

Let’s consider that the compound is made up of a certain number of C atoms and H atoms. Let me first determine how many C and H atoms are in the molecule.

The formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group:

Looking at the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-

That's a propene derivative. Let's count the carbons and hydrogens.

Each CH3 has 3 H, two of those would be 6 H.

The (CH3)2C=CH- part is (CH3)2-C=CH2? Wait, no, maybe it's (CH3)2C-CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a chain with double bonds in two places. Let me count the number of C and H.

But maybe a quicker way is to note that each (CH3) group contributes 3 H, and the molecule has a certain number of C and H.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the molecular formula.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Breaking it down:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- contributes:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 2*(CH3) = 2 C and 6 H, plus a C (central), and CH- group. So that's 3 C, 7 H? Wait, let me count each part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should determine the molecular formula.

Let me count C and H:

Each (CH3) contributes 1 C and 3 H. So two (CH3)s contribute 2 C and 6 H.

The C in the middle would be another C. So each (CH3)2C=CH- group is 3 C and 7 H. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let me count each segment:

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-
That's 2*(CH3) → 2 C and 6 H, plus C (so 3 C so far) and CH- (1 C, 1 H). So for this part, 3+1=4 C? No, wait: (CH3)2C- is (CH3)2C-: 3 C, and each CH3 has 3 H, so 6 H. Then the =CH- part adds another C and 1 H. So the first part is 4 C and 7 H.

Wait, maybe it's easier to write the entire formula.

The given compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, let's break it down into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-
   - 2 CH3 groups: 2 C and 6 H.
   - The central C: 1 C.
   - CH: 1 C and 1 H.
   So this part has 3 C (from CH3s and C), and H is 6 + 1 =7. But wait, the double bond is between the central C and the next C. So perhaps it's a propene derivative. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pentene structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, that's a long chain. Let's count the number of C and H.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C12H18? Let me check.

Wait, another approach: Each group contributes a certain number of C and H.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C:

Each (CH3) is 1 C, so the first (CH3)2C= gives 3 C (2 CH3 and 1 C). Then CH- is 1 C, so that's 4 so far. Then CH2-: 1 C → 5. Then CH(CH3): 1 C, plus the CH3 adds another C → 6. Then CH2-: 1 C → 7. Then CH=C(CH3)2: the CH is 1 C, the C is 1, and the two CH3 groups add 2 C. So 1 +1 +2 =4, making total 7 +4 =11 C? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write out each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- → (CH3)2C=CH- has 4 C (two CH3's, one C in the middle, and one CH). H count: 6 (from CH3*2) + 1 (from CH) =7 H.

2. CH2- → 1 C, 2 H.

3. CH(CH3)- → 1 C, 3 H (from CH plus CH3), but wait, CH(CH3) has 4 H? Because CH2-CH(CH3)- would have the CH2 as 2 H, and the CH(CH3) as 1 H on the C plus 3 from CH3. Wait, no, CH(CH3) has 1 C, 4 H (the C is connected to CH2, CH3, and the rest.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of each segment:

The entire molecule:

- (CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C, 7 H.

Then CH2- → 1 C, 2 H.

Then CH(CH3)- → 1 C, 4 H (since CH(CH3) has 1 C, attached to CH2, CH3, and another CH2. So the C has two Hs: one from CH2 and two others? Or maybe I'm complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just note that each (CH3) group has 3 H, each CH2 has 2 H, and each CH has 1 H.

But perhaps a better approach is to count all the Hs in the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the molecular formula. Let me try to see how many C and H are present.

Each (CH3) group is 1 C and 3 H. So:

- The first group is (CH3)2C=CH- → 3 C (2 from CH3, 1 central C) and 7 H (6 from CH3s, 1 from CH).

Then comes CH2- → 1 C, 2 H.

Then CH(CH3)- → 1 C, 4 H (1 from CH, 3 from CH3).

Then CH2- → 1 C, 2 H.

Then CH=C(CH3)2 → the CH has 1 C, 1 H; the C= has another C, and two CH3 groups (each 1 C, 3 H). So that's 3 C and 7 H.

Wait, adding up:

First part: 3 C, 7 H.

CH2: +1 C, +2 H → 4 C, 9 H.

CH(CH3): +1 C, +4 H → 5 C, 13 H.

CH2: +1 C, +2 H →6 C,15 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: 1 (CH) +1 (C) = 2 C, plus 2*(CH3) → 2*(1 C) → total for this part is 4 C. So overall, 6 +4 =10 C.

H: previous 15 H, plus CH has 1, C has 0, and two CH3 groups contribute 6 H → 15 +1 +6=22 H.

Wait, but I'm getting 10 C and 22 H. So the molecular formula would be C10H22.

Wait, but double-checking the structure again: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count each C and H.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 10-carbon molecule. Let me recount.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- → 3 C and 7 H.

CH2- → 1 C, 2 H.

CH(CH3)- →1 C, 4 H.

CH2- →1 C, 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2 → 3 C (CH, C, and two CH3's), 7 H (1 from CH, 0 from C, and 6 from two CH3). Wait, no, the structure is CH=C(CH3)2, which is CH2-C(CH3)2? Wait, no. It's CH2-CH=C(CH3)2? No, the structure given is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the last part is CH=C(CH3)2. So that's CH (1 C, 1 H) connected via a double bond to C, which has two CH3 groups (each 1 C, 3 H). So that's 1 +1 +2 =4 C, 1 + 6 (from CH3 groups) =7 H.

So adding each part:

(CH3)2C=CH- → 3 C, 7 H.

CH2 →1 C,2 H.

CH(CH3) →1 C,4 H.

CH2 →1 C,2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2 →4 C,7 H.

Total C: 3+1+1+1+4 =10 C.

H:7+2+4+2+7=22 H.

So molecular formula is C10H22.

Wait, but 10 carbons in the molecule. So the reaction is 10 C (graphite) + (22/2) H2 → C10H22.

Wait, wait: for each H2 molecule, we get 2 H. So for 22 H, we need 11 moles of H2.

So the reaction is:

10 C (graphite) + 11 H2 → C10H22.

Now, to calculate the enthalpy of formation, we need to compute the energy change for this reaction.

The formula is:

ΔHf = [sum (bond energies of reactants)] - [sum (bond energies of product)]

Wait, but the reactants are C (graphite) and H2, so the bonds to break are the C-C bonds in graphite and the H-H bonds in H2.

Wait, but wait, when C is in graphite, each C is bonded to multiple others. So how do we calculate the bond energy for the reactant C?

Well, the question gives the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. So, for 1 mole of C (graphite), the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ, which is the energy required to break all bonds in C (graphite) to produce C atoms.

Wait, but in the formation reaction, we are starting from C (graphite) and H2, and making C10H22. So we need to break the bonds in C (graphite) and H2, and form the bonds in C10H22.

Wait, but in the product, the bonds present are C-C, C=C, and C-H, and H-H? No, product is the molecule, which has C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds, but no H-H because it's a hydrocarbon.

Wait, no. The product is C10H22, a hydrocarbon. So the bonds are C-C, C=C, and C-H.

So the process is:

1. Break the bonds in the reactants (C and H2) → requires energy.

2. Form the bonds in the product → releases energy.

So the enthalpy change (ΔHf) is the sum of the energies required to break the reactant bonds minus the sum of the energies released when forming the product bonds.

So the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (10 × enthalpy of atomization per C) + (11 × bond energy of H2) ) ] - [ sum of all bond energies in product ]

Wait, no. Let me correct that.

The reactants are 10 moles of C (graphite) and 11 moles of H2.

The bonds to break in the reactants are C-C bonds in graphite and H-H bonds in H2.

Each mole of C (graphite) requires 1000 kJ to break all its bonds (atomization). So for 10 moles, that's 10 × 1000 = 10,000 kJ.

Each mole of H2 has 1 bond (H-H), which requires 100 kJ to break. For 11 moles of H2, that's 11 × 100 = 1100 kJ.

So total energy to break reactant bonds: 10,000 + 1100 = 11,100 kJ.

Now, the product is C10H22, which has:

- Number of C-C bonds: Let's see. The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. It's a 10-carbon chain with some substituents and double bonds.

Wait, actually, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of each type of bond (C-C, C=C, C-H) in the product.

Each molecule of C10H22 has:

- Each carbon in the chain contributes to C-C bonds.

But wait, the molecule has 10 carbons. Each C-C bond connects two carbons, so the number of C-C bonds in a chain would be 9. But considering the structure, some are single, some are double bonds (we have two double bonds, as per the formula).

Wait, the molecule has (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So the double bonds are between which carbons?

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : double bond between the central C and the next C.

- Then, after some CH2 groups, there's another double bond at the end: -CH=C(CH3)2.

So two double bonds: one at the beginning and one at the end. So the molecule has two C=C bonds.

So the product has:

- Number of C-C bonds: Let's think. Each single bond between carbons is C-C. But in a molecule, each carbon (except the ends) is connected to two others. But the total number of C-C bonds can be calculated as:

Total C-C bonds = (number of carbons) - 1 - number of double bonds.

Wait, no. The formula for the number of C-C bonds in a molecule is:

Each C in the chain forms bonds. For a straight chain of n carbons, there are (n-1) C-C single bonds. But the presence of double bonds complicates this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count each type of bond.

In the product (C10H22), the structure has two double bonds (C=C). Each double bond replaces a single bond, so the number of C-C single bonds would be (10 - 1) - number of double bonds. Wait, no. Let me think: in a straight chain of 10 carbons, there would be 9 single C-C bonds. Each double bond reduces the number by one (since a double bond is a single bond plus one more). So with two double bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 9 - 2 =7.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think of a simple case. For example, propane has 2 C-C single bonds. If it were propene (one double bond), it would have 1 C-C single bond and 1 C=C double bond. So total C-C bonds (single) plus C=C bonds (double) is 1 + 1 = 2, which equals (3-1) =2.

So for a molecule with n carbons, the total number of C-C bonds (single and double) is (n -1). So for 10 carbons, 9 C-C bonds. Out of these, 2 are double bonds (C=C), so the remaining 7 are single bonds (C-C).

So:

Number of C=C bonds: 2 → each contributes 300 kJ (since bond energy of C=C is 300 kJ/mol).

Number of C-C single bonds: 7 → each contributes 200 kJ (since bond energy of C-C is 200 kJ/mol).

Now, the C-H bonds: each molecule has 22 H atoms. Each H is bonded to a C, so number of C-H bonds is 22. Each C-H bond has energy 400 kJ.

So sum of bond energies in product:

C-C single bonds: 7 × 200 = 1400 kJ.

C=C bonds: 2 × 300 = 600 kJ.

C-H bonds: 22 × 400 = 8800 kJ.

Total bonds in product: 1400 + 600 + 8800 = 10,800 kJ.

Wait, but wait, each bond is counted once per molecule, so for each molecule, the sum of bond energies is 10,800 kJ.

But the product is 1 mole, so the total bond energy is 10,800 kJ.

Now, the reaction is:

10 C (graphite) + 11 H2 → C10H22.

The energy for breaking reactant bonds is 11,100 kJ (as calculated earlier).

The energy for forming product bonds is 10,800 kJ.

So ΔHf is (energy required to break reactant bonds) - (energy released when forming product bonds) = 11,100 - 10,800 = 300 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the enthalpy of atomization is per mole of C. Wait, no. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

The bond energies in the product are the sum of all bonds formed, which is 10,800 kJ per mole of product.

The reactant bonds' energies are sum of 10,000 kJ (from C) and 11 × 100 kJ (from H2) → 10,000 + 1,100 = 11,100 kJ.

So ΔHf = 11,100 - 10,800 = 300 kJ/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 11,200 kJ/mol. Hmm, no. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds. Let me recount.

In the product, C10H22:

Number of C=C bonds: 2.

Number of C-C single bonds: 7.

Number of C-H bonds: 22.

So the sum is:

C-C:7 × 200 =1400.

C=C:2×300=600.

C-H:22×400=8800.

Total: 1400 + 600 = 2000; 2000 +8800=10,800.

So the product's bond energy is 10,800 kJ.

So ΔHf = 11,100 -10,800 = 300 kJ.

But looking at the options, option A is 11,200 kJ/mol, which is way higher. Option B is 67.4, which is nothing like this. Option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is a different unit. Option D is 1900 kJ/g, again different units.

Wait, so maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is per mole of C, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So for 10 moles of C, it's 10 × 1000 =10,000 kJ.

But wait, in the reaction, each C in the product is bonded to others. So when we break the C-C bonds in graphite (10,000 kJ), we get 10 moles of C atoms. Then, when forming the product bonds, each C atom is bonded to others again.

Wait, but wait, in the product, each C is bonded to other C's and H's. So perhaps I should consider each C contributing a certain number of bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the sum of all bonds in the product and subtract the sum of bonds in the reactants.

Wait, the correct formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of products)]

No, wait, no. Wait, when bonds are broken in the reactants, it requires energy (positive). When bonds are formed in products, it releases energy (negative). So the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of products)]

Wait, no. Wait, the bonds in the reactants are being broken, so the energy is being input. The bonds in the products are being formed, releasing energy.

So the overall enthalpy change is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

Wait, but in the reaction, you are starting with reactants and ending with products.

Wait, correct formula is:

ΔHf = [sum (bonds broken in reactants)] - [sum (bonds formed in products)]

So in this case:

Bonds broken in reactants: C-C in graphite (10,000 kJ) and H-H (11 × 100 = 1100 → 11,100 kJ).

Bonds formed in products: 10,800 kJ.

So ΔHf = 11,100 - 10,800 = 300 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 300. Hmm.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D) 1900 kJ/g

None of these is 300. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the number of C in the molecule. Let me recount the C.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- is 3 C (two CH3 and one C).

Then CH2 is another C →4.

Then CH(CH3) → another C→5.

Then CH2 →6.

Then CH=C(CH3)2 →3 C (CH, C, and two CH3's) → total 6+3=9? Wait, no. Let me recount:

Wait, perhaps the correct count is:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has 3 C.

Then CH2- →1 →4.

CH(CH3)- →1 →5.

CH2- →1 →6.

CH=C(CH3)2 →3 (CH, C, and two CH3's) →6+3=9 C.

Wait, but that's 9 C, but earlier I thought it was 10. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the entire molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- →3 C.

2. CH2- →1 C →4.

3. CH(CH3)- →1 C →5.

4. CH2- →1 C →6.

5. CH=C(CH3)2 → 3 C (CH, C, and two CH3's) →6 +3=9.

So total of 9 C. But wait, I thought the formula was C10H22. Maybe I was wrong.

Wait, let's recount:

Each CH3 is 1 C.

So:

(CH3)2C=CH- → 2*(CH3) =2 C, plus the C in the middle →3 C.

CH2- →1 →4.

CH(CH3)- →1 →5.

CH2- →1 →6.

CH=C(CH3)2 →1 (CH) +1 (C) +2*(CH3) →1+1+2=4 →6+4=10 C.

Oh! There we go. So it's 10 C.

So the initial calculation was correct. So the product is 1 mole of C10H22.

So the bond energies sum up to 10,800 kJ.

So ΔHf is 11,100 -10,800 = 300 kJ.

But looking back at the options, no option is 300. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond energy calculation. Let me recheck:

Wait, the bond energies given are:

C-C:200

C=C:300

C-H:400

H-H:100

So for the product:

C-C bonds:7 →7×200=1400.

C=C:2×300=600.

C-H:22×400=8800.

Total 1400+600=2000; 2000+8800=10,800.

Yes, that's correct.

So the enthalpy of formation is 300 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the enthalpies of all bonds in the reactants minus the sum of the bonds in the products.

But wait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Maybe it's:

ΔHf = sum (bonds in products) - sum (bonds in reactants)

Wait, no. Because when you form bonds, energy is released (negative), and breaking bonds requires energy (positive). So the correct formula is:

ΔHf = (sum bonds broken in reactants) – (sum bonds formed in products)

Which is (11,100) – (10,800) = +300 kJ/mol.

So the formation is endothermic, which makes sense for a hydrocarbon.

But the options don't have 300. Hmm.

Looking again at the options, option A is 11200 kJ/mol. That's way higher than my calculation. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which is actually a 10-carbon molecule, but I counted 10 C, so the reaction is 10 C + 11 H2 → C10H22.

But perhaps the reaction uses 10 moles of C, each contributing 1000 kJ, so 10×1000=10,000 kJ.

H2: 11 moles × 100 =1100 → 11,100.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the bonds in the product.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is different. Let me recount.

In the product molecule, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The double bonds are between carbons 1-2 and 7-8 (assuming the chain is numbered from left to right).

So the molecule has two double bonds.

Each double bond is a C=C.

So for the molecule, number of C-C single bonds is (number of C) -1 - number of double bonds.

Number of C:10.

So 10-1=9 bonds. Minus 2 double bonds →7 single C-C bonds.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the C-H bonds count is wrong. Let me count the H in the molecule again.

Each (CH3) group contributes 3 H. The molecule has:

- (CH3)2C=CH- → (CH3)2 → 6 H, and the CH- →1 H →7 H.

Then CH2- →2 H.

Then CH(CH3) →CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 →4 H.

Then CH2 →2 H.

Then CH=C(CH3)2 →CH →1 H, C has nothing (since it's double bonded), and each CH3 →3 H each, so 6 H → total 7 H in this part.

So total H in the product is 7 +2 +4 +2 +7=22 H. So 22 C-H bonds.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So according to this, the answer should be 300 kJ/mol, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says 'calculate the enthalpy of formation of ...' and gives bond energies. But wait, the bond energies are given per bond, but perhaps they're given per mole. So perhaps I should consider all the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, no. I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of atomization, not the enthalpy of formation. But the question says enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the enthalpy of atomization of C is 1000 kJ per mole of C, so for 10 moles, it's 10×1000=10,000 kJ.

H2 is 100 kJ per bond. So 11 H2 contribute 11×100=1100 kJ → total 11,100.

Product bonds sum to 10,800.

So 11,100 - 10,800 =300 kJ.

But options don't have 300.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Another way to think about enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf = (sum of enthalpies of elements) – (sum of bonds in compound)

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf = (sum [Σ atoms (atomic enthalpy)] ) – (sum [Σ bonds (bond energies)] )

But I'm not sure.

Wait, the standard approach is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (H of elements) ] – [Σ (bonds in compound) ]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is:

ΔHf° = Σ (bonds broken in reactants) – Σ (bonds formed in products)

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the molecule from its elements, but in the calculation, it's positive 300 kJ/mol, which would imply an endothermic formation. But looking at the options, option A is 11200, which is way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of bonds.

Wait, another possibility: I may have counted the number of bonds incorrectly. Let me recount the bonds in the product.

In the product:

Each (CH3) group has 3 C-H bonds. The molecule has multiple CH3 groups.

Looking at the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 contributes 3 C-H bonds.

So:

- (CH3)2C=CH- → 2 ×3 =6 C-H.

- CH2 → 2 C-H.

- CH(CH3) → 1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) =4.

- CH2 →2.

- CH=C(CH3)2 →1 (from CH) + 2×3 (from two CH3) →7.

Wait, but the CH=C(CH3)2 group has one CH (1 H) and two CH3 groups. So that's 1 + 3×2 =7 H → but that's for H count, but the C-H bonds would be 1 (from CH) + 2×3 (from each CH3) → 1+6=7 C-H bonds in this part.

So adding up:

Part 1: 6.

Part 2: 2.

Part 3:4.

Part4:2.

Part5:7.

Total:6+2=8; 8+4=12; 12+2=14; 14+7=21.

Wait, but the molecule has 22 H, so perhaps I'm missing one. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So let's see:

Each (CH3) in the first part →3×2=6.

The CH- →1.

Then CH2 →2.

Then CH(CH3) →1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) →4.

Then CH2 →2.

Then CH →1.

Then C(CH3)2 → each CH3 has 3 H → 2×3=6.

So total:

6 (from first two CH3) +1 (CH) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH and CH3) +2 (CH2) +1 (CH) +6 (from two CH3) =6+1=7; 7+2=9;9+4=13;13+2=15;15+1=16;16+6=22.

Ah, okay, now I get 22 H. So the C-H bonds are 22. So no mistake there.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is actually C12H22, not C10H22. Let me recount the C.

Looking again:

(CH3)2C=CH- →3 C.

CH2 →1 →4.

CH(CH3) →1 →5.

CH2 →1 →6.

CH=C(CH3)2 →3 C (CH, C, and two CH3) →6+3=9.

Wait, that's 9 C, but I thought earlier it's 10. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a C.

Wait, perhaps the structure is longer. Let me count each C:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- →3 C.

2. CH2 →1 →4.

3. CH(CH3) →1 →5.

4. CH2 →1 →6.

5. CH →1 →7.

6. C= →1 →8.

7. (CH3)2 →2 C →10.

Ah, so the structure is 10 C.

So, yes, the product is C10H22. So the previous calculation holds.

Hmm, so according to all this, the correct ΔHf is 300 kJ/mol, but the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 11.44 kJ/g, and D is 1900 kJ/g.

So perhaps I should calculate it per gram.

First, find the molar mass of the product: C10H22.

Molar mass = (10×12) + (22×1) =120 +22=142 g/mol.

So 300 kJ/mol is 300 /142 ≈2.112 kJ/g.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm way off.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to provide the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 100 kJ/mol, but in the question, it's 1000. That would change things.

But the question states 1000, so I can't change that.

Another possibility: I inverted the calculation. Maybe the correct formula is [sum (products) - sum (reactants)].

So ΔHf = 10,800 – 11,100 = -300 kJ/mol.

But that would make the formation exothermic, which is more typical for hydrocarbons, but in that case, the answer would be -300, which is not in the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, each molecule has 10 C atoms, but the number of C-C bonds is (n-1) where n is the number of C in a linear chain, but the presence of branches might affect this.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is actually a cyclic structure, but the formula given doesn't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has more double bonds than I thought. Let me look again.

The formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So two double bonds: one at the start and one at the end.

So two C=C bonds.

So that part is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the C-C bond count is incorrect. Let me think of the molecule as follows:

The molecule is a chain of 10 C atoms, with two double bonds. So the number of C-C bonds would be 9 (since 10 C in a chain have 9 C-C bonds).

But two of these are double bonds (C=C), so the number of C-C single bonds is 9 - 2 =7.

So that part is correct.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. According to my calculation, the answer should be 300 kJ/mol, but it's not among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about enthalpy of formation but about enthalpy of combustion or something else. But the question clearly states enthalpy of formation.

Wait, perhaps the question's bond energies are given per mole, not per bond. Oh! Wait, bond energies are usually given per mole of bonds. So for example, C-H bond strength is 400 kJ per mole of bonds.

Wait, but in that case, for the product, the number of C-H bonds is 22, so each mole of product has 22 moles of C-H bonds. So the total bond energy is 22 ×400 =8800 kJ per mole of product.

Similarly, 7 C-C bonds →7×200=1400.

2 C=C →2×300=600.

So total product bonds: 8800+1400+600=10,800 kJ per mole.

Reactants: 10×1000 (C) + 11×100 (H2) =10,000 +1,100=11,100.

ΔHf =11,100 -10,800=300 kJ/mol.

But again, the options don’t have this. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11,200 kJ/mol. But how?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the number of C atoms. Let me recount:

In the formula (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is 1 C.

So:

(CH3)2C=CH- →3 C.

CH2 →1 →4.

CH(CH3) →1 →5.

CH2 →1 →6.

CH →1 →7.

C= →1 →8.

(CH3)2 →2 →10.

Yes, 10 C.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the formation from elements but from some other state. Or perhaps the approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy change using the formula:

ΔHf = (sum of the enthalpies of the elements) - (sum of the bonds in the compound )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in the compound) - (sum of bond energies in reactants)

Which would be 10,800 -11,100= -300.

But again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond energy of C in graphite. The enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ per mole of C (in graphite), which is the energy to break all bonds in C (graphite) to produce C atoms.

In the reaction, for each C atom, we're using one C atom from graphite. So for 10 C atoms, it's 10 ×1000=10,000 kJ.

But wait, in the product, the C atoms are bonded to each other and H, so perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the sum of all bonds in the product and subtract the sum of all bonds in the reactants.

So ΔHf = (sum bonds in product) – (sum bonds in reactants).

But that would be 10,800 –11,100= -300 kJ. But again, not matching options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the sum of all bonds in the product and subtract from the sum of bonds in the reactants, but I'm getting a positive 300, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is actually C12H22, which would change the calculation. Let me check.

If the formula is C12H22, then the reaction would be 12 C +11 H2 →C12H22.

Then, bonds in product:

C-C:11 →11×200=2200.

C=C:2 →600.

C-H:22×400=8800.

Total:2200 +600 =2800 +8800=11,600.

Reactant bonds:

12×1000=12,000.

H2:11×100=1,100 → total 13,100.

ΔHf=13,100 –11,600=1,500 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A:11,200. Let me see what that would imply.

If ΔHf is 11,200, then the sum of product bonds would be 11,100 –11,200= -100. Which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question's given bond energies are per mole of bonds, not per bond. So for example, C-C is 200 kJ per mole of bonds.

In that case, the calculation is correct as done before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the product has more C-C bonds. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the number of C-C bonds is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should model the structure as a chain and count the single bonds.

For example, in a straight chain of 10 C's with two double bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 9 - 2 =7, as I thought.

Yes, that part is correct.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is incorrect, and the correct answer is option B:67.4 kJ/mol. But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of C-H bonds. Let me recount.

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds.

In the product:

Number of CH3 groups: Let's see.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has two CH3 →2.

CH2 groups: each has two CH2 → but in the structure, how many CH2 groups are there?

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So CH2 groups are:

- After the first double bond: CH2- →1.

- Then CH(CH3) → no CH2 after that, but there's another CH2- before the next double bond.

So CH2- appears twice: once after the first double bond and once before the last double bond.

So 2 CH2 groups, each contributes 2 C-H bonds →4.

Then, the CH=C(CH3)2 part has one CH and two CH3 groups →1 + 6=7.

Wait, perhaps the count is as follows:

- (CH3)2C=CH- →2 CH3 →6 C-H.

- CH2- →2.

- CH(CH3) →1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) →4.

- CH2- →2.

- CH →1.

- (CH3)2 →6.

Total:6 +2=8 +4=12 +2=14 +1=15 +6=21.

Wait, that's 21, but earlier I counted 22. So perhaps I'm missing one.

Ah, perhaps the CH=C(CH3)2 has a CH group, which is 1 H, and each CH3 has 3 → so 1 + 6=7. So that part contributes 7.

So adding:

6 (from first CH3) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +7 (CH=C(CH3)2) =6+2=8; +4=12; +2=14; +7=21. So where's the 22nd H?

Ah, perhaps I missed the CH=C part. The CH in CH=C has one H, but the C is double-bonded, so no H. So the CH=C has 1 H.

So adding that:

21 +1 =22.

Ah, that's where the 22 comes from. So the count is correct.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the answer should be 300 kJ/mol, but it's not present in the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem understanding.

Wait, looking back at the question, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which has two double bonds. So perhaps there are more C=C bonds than I thought.

Wait, no, the formula clearly shows two double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclic compound with more double bonds, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 12 carbons, but I thought it was 10. Let me recount.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- →3 C.

CH2 →1 →4.

CH(CH3) →1 →5.

CH2 →1 →6.

CH →1 →7.

C= →1 →8.

(CH3)2 →2 →10.

Yes, 10 C, so 10 moles.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 11200 kJ/mol, but I have no idea how to get there. Let me see what that would imply.

If ΔHf is 11200 kJ/mol, then:

11200 = 11,100 (reactant bonds) – product bonds.

Product bonds = 11,100 –11,200 = -100.

Which doesn't make sense because bond energies can't be negative.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total bonds in the product and then use that as the enthalpy of formation. No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the enthalpy of atomization is per mole of C, but each C in the product is bonded to 4 others (on average), so:

Each C in product has 4 bonds →10 C →40 bonds. But this approach doesn't fit with the given data.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm not sure where the mistake is, but according to my calculation, the answer should be 300 kJ/mol, which isn't an option. Perhaps the correct answer is option A:11200 kJ/mol, but I can't see how to reach it with the given data.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the product, not the formation. Let me think.

Enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break all bonds in the product to make atoms. So for the product, it's the sum of all bond energies.

Which would be 10,800 kJ/mol.

But option A is 11200, which is higher. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the product has 12 C atoms. Let me recount.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is 1 C.

So:

(CH3)2 →2.

C →1.

=CH →1.

CH2 →1.

CH(CH3) →1.

CH2 →1.

CH →1.

C →1.

(CH3)2 →2.

Total:2+1+1+1+1+1+1+2=10.

No, it's 10 C.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. I think I've done everything correctly, but the answer isn't matching the options. I'll have to go with my calculation of 300 kJ/mol, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:11200, but I'm not sure how to get there.


The problem involves calculating the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2** using the provided bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The reaction considered is the formation of the compound from its elements, carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas (H2). The formula for the enthalpy of formation is:

\[
\Delta H_f = \text{[Sum of bond energies of reactants]} - \text{[Sum of bond energies of products]}
\]

### Key Steps and Analysis:

1. **Molecular Formula Determination**:
   - The compound is analyzed to have **10 carbons (C)** and **22 hydrogens (H)**, giving the molecular formula **C10H22**.

2. **Reaction Setup**:
   - The reaction is:
     \[
     10 \, \text{C (graphite)} + 11 \, \text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2}
     \]
   - **Reactants**: 10 moles of C (graphite) and 11 moles of H2.
   - **Product**: 1 mole of C10H22.

3. **Bond Energies**:
   - **C-C (single bond)**: 200 kJ/mol
   - **C=C (double bond)**: 300 kJ/mol
   - **C-H**: 400 kJ/mol
   - **H-H**: 100 kJ/mol
   - **Enthalpy of atomization of C (graphite)**: 1000 kJ/mol.

4. **Energy to Break Reactant Bonds**:
   - **C (graphite)**: 10 moles × 1000 kJ/mol = 10,000 kJ.
   - **H2**: 11 moles × 100 kJ/mol = 1,100 kJ.
   - Total energy to break reactant bonds: \( 10,000 + 1,100 = 11,100 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Energy to Form Product Bonds**:
   - The product C10H22 has:
     - **C-C single bonds**: 7 bonds × 200 kJ/mol = 1,400 kJ.
     - **C=C double bonds**: 2 bonds × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.
     - **C-H bonds**: 22 bonds × 400 kJ/mol = 8,800 kJ.
   - Total energy to form product bonds: \( 1,400 + 600 + 8,800 = 10,800 \, \text{kJ} \).

6. **Enthalpy of Formation**:
   - Using the formula:
     \[
     \Delta H_f = \text{[Sum of bond energies of reactants]} - \text{[Sum of bond energies of products]}
     \]
     \[
     \Delta H_f = 11,100 - 10,800 = 300 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
     \]

7. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value of \( 300 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) does not match any of the provided options:
     - **A) 11,200 kJ/mol**
     - **B) 67.4 kJ/mol**
     - **C) 11.44 kJ/g**
     - **D) 1900 kJ/g**
   - None of the options align with the calculated result. However, based on the structure of the problem and the given data, the most plausible answer is **A) 11,200 kJ/mol**, though the reasoning to reach this value is unclear.

### Conclusion:
The calculated enthalpy of formation is \( 300 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), but since this value is not among the options, the closest match is **A) 11,200 kJ/mol**, despite the discrepancy.

Answer: A
