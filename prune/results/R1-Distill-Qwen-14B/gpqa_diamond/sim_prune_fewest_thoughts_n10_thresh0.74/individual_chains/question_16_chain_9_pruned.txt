Okay, so I have this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me think through each compound one by one. Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a compound has chirality, which is when it has a stereocenter or some kind of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The question gives seven compounds, and I need to count how many are optically active. Let's go through each.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm, structure-wise, I think this is an alkene with substituents on C1 and C2. Let me draw it. The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2... Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So position 1 is CH2Cl, position 2 is C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, maybe I should think of but-1-ene as CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, no, wait.

Wait, the substituents... The structure is CH2Cl attached to a double bond. So,
