Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The problem says that a Pi(+) particle is at rest and decays into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles, which are the muon and the neutrino. The options are given as A to D, each with two values. 

Hmm, wait. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum should still be zero, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But neutrinos are tricky because they have very small (possibly zero) rest mass. Oh wait, in this case, I think the neutrino is considered massless for these purposes, right? Or maybe we're supposed to treat it as having negligible mass compared to the other particles. That would make sense, because in particle physics, neutrinos are often treated as massless in such calculations unless stated otherwise.

So, the pion is at rest, so its initial kinetic energy is zero. The pion's rest energy is converted into the rest mass energies of the muon and neutrino, plus their kinetic energies. Since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

Let me think about the energy and momentum conservation here. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of energies of muon and neutrino. So, E_final = E_mu + E_nu. 

The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu, and E_nu = p_nu c (since if the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, E = pc). 

So, E_final = m_mu c² + K_mu + p_nu c. 

But from conservation of energy, E_final = E_initial, so:
