Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember paramagnetism has something to do with the magnetic field affecting the energy levels of an atom. Let me break this down.

First, the setup: the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and is 1 Tesla. The problem mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. So I think that m is probably related to the orientation of the electron's magnetic moment relative to the field.

The question asks to compare the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy due to the magnetic interaction) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength given as 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that's the wavelength for a specific transition in hydrogen, right? I think that's the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is around 656 nm but wait, 0.486 micrometers is 486 nm, which is the Balmer-alpha emission line. So ΔE is the energy difference between two energy levels in hydrogen.

Next, I need to calculate or estimate the magnitude of these two energies. Let me recall the formulas.

The energy levels of a hydrogen atom are given by the Rydberg formula. The transition energy can be found using ΔE = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

The paramagnetic coupling term, I think, comes from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by the Bohr magneton multiplied by m, I think. The Bohr magneton μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e), where e is the electron charge, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and m_e is the electron mass. But wait, the magnetic dipole interaction energy is H = -μ·B. So the energy shift would be proportional to μ * B. Since m is small, like maybe m=1 or something, but wait, m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, I think. Or maybe it's s, p, etc. But the problem states small m, so perhaps m is 1.

So the paramagnetic term would be something like ΔE_param = μ_B * m * B. But wait, I think the energy is actually μ·B, and μ for orbital angular momentum is (μ_B) * (L_z)/(ħ/2) ? Wait, maybe I should think more carefully. The magnetic dipole moment due to orbital angular momentum is given by μ = (e/(2m_e)) * L, so L in terms of quantum numbers is ħ m. So perhaps μ = (μ_B) * m * ħ / ħ? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, the energy due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B. So for orbital magnetic moment, the energy shift is H = -μ_L · B. μ_L is proportional to L, which is mħ. So μ_L = μ_B *
