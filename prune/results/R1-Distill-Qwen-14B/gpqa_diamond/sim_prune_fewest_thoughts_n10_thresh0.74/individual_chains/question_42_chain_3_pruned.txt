Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I don't think that part is directly relevant to solving this problem, so I'll focus on the given data.

The problem states the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is 1.4 times that of Planet2, and Planet2's temperature is 2.3 times that of Planet3.

Then, the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So, Planet1 is 1.15 times the mass of Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3. I'm not sure yet how mass factors into this, but it's part of the data.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. All three have the same albedo of 0.3, which is similar to Earth's. So, albedo doesn't vary here.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature—right, the formula for equilibrium temperature. I think the formula is T = ( ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, in this problem, the albedos are the same for all three planets, so a=0.3 for each. So when comparing the temperatures, the albedo term (1-a) will be the same for all, so it cancels out when taking the ratio.

But wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, right? Because T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So, T ∝ 1/√D. So, T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Or wait, let me get that right.

Let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L (1 - a))/(16 π σ D²)]^(1/4). So, if I take the ratio T1/T2, that would be [( (L1(1-a1) )/(D1²) ) / ( (L2(1-a2))/(D2²) ) ]^(1/4). But since all planets orbit the same star, L1 = L2 = L3 = L. And albedos are the same, so (1-a) is the same. So the ratio of T1 to T2 is sqrt( (D2²) / (D1²) ) )^(1/4) ?

Wait, wait, let me re-arrange. Let's write T1 = ( L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D1²) )^(
