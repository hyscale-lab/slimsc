Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I remember that when you're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That means time moves slower for the traveler compared to someone watching from afar.

So the scenario is, aliens from the Large Magellanic Cloud have a spacecraft going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 solar years. Wait, but Earth is the destination. I need to find out how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity. The key idea is that time experienced by the traveler (proper time) is less than the time experienced by someone at rest relative to the Earth (coordinate time). So the astronaut's clock will tick slower than the Earth's clock.

First, I should figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I think the LMC is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years away from Earth. Let's approximate it as, say, 163,000 light-years. But wait, maybe the exact distance isn't given, so perhaps I can proceed with the given speed and the concept.

The speed is 0.99999987 c. That's extremely close to the speed of light. So the time taken from Earth's frame would be distance divided by speed. But the astronaut's experienced time is less due to time dilation.

Wait, but the question is asking for the time experienced by the astronaut, which is their proper time. Oh right, so we need to calculate the proper time.

Proper time, τ, is calculated using the Lorentz transformation. The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time in Earth's frame, and v is the spacecraft's speed.

But to get t, the Earth frame time, we can compute it as distance divided by speed. Let's denote the distance as D. So t = D / v.

Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh wait, the LMC is a known distance from Earth. Let me think, the average distance is about 160,000 light-years.
