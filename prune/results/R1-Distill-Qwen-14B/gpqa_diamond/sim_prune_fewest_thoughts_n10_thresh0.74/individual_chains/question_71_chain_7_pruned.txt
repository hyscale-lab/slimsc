Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

So the question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for Transit Timing Variation, I remember that's a method used to detect exoplanets by looking at changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But I don't think that part affects the temperature calculation, so I can probably set that aside.

The planets are in orbital resonance, which means their orbital periods have ratios that are simple fractions. The problem states the periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So let's say Planet_1 has period P, Planet_2 has 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. 

The question asks about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. They have the same albedo, so that shouldn't affect the ratio—albedo is a measure of reflectivity, so if they have the same, the calculations would be simpler.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I think is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star. But since all the planets are around the same star and the albedos are the same, the L and a would cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance D. But wait, how do I find the distance for each planet? Well, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which, since the orbits are circular, is just the radius). So, P² ∝ D³. 

But wait, the actual form of the law is P² = (4π²/GM) * D³, so P² is proportional to D³. So D is proportional to P^(2/3). 

So the distance D for each planet can be written as D_i = k * P_i^(1/3), where k is some constant. But since we're taking the ratio of two planets, the constants will cancel out.

So the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to D^(1/2), because T ∝ D^(-1/2) from the formula I mentioned earlier. Let me double-check that. Oh right, the formula for T is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, so yes, T is proportional to (L(1-a))^(1/4) * (1/(D²))^(1/4). Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the formula is T = [(L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²)]^(1/4). So T is proportional to (L (1-a))^(1/4) * (1/D²
