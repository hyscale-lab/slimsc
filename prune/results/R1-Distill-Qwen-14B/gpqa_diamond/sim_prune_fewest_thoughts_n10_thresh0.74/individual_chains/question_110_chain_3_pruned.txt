Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The key point is their brightness in the V band because each instrument has a different magnitude limit.

ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, any star that is brighter than 17 mag (since 17 is the higher threshold) can be seen by both? Wait, no. Because if a star is brighter than 17, it's also brighter than 16. So, the stricter condition is the 16 mag for HIRES. So, any star that is brighter than 16 mag V can be detected by both. Because both instruments can detect it. Alternatively, wait, no. Because if a star is fainter than 16, HIRES can't detect it, but if it's brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can. Wait, let me think more clearly.

Wait, the brightness limit is the maximum magnitude that can be observed. So, for a star to be observable by ESPRESSO, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (brighter). For HIRES, the apparent V magnitude must be less than 16 (brighter, since lower magnitudes are brighter). So, any star that
