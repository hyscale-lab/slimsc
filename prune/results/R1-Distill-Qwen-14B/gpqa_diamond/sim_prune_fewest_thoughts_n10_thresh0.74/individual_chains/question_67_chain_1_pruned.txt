Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, the question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. I need to find the probability of both their L_z measurements being -ħ. 

Wait, the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. Right, in angular momentum coupling, the notation is usually |l1, l2, L, M>. So each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 since they're in p orbitals. The total angular momentum quantum number L is 2, and M is -1. 

But wait, the question says to ignore spin, so we're only looking at orbital angular momentum here. So the state is a coupled state of the two electrons' orbital angular momenta.

The problem asks for the joint probability that measuring L_{1z} and L_{2z} both give -ħ. Since each L_{i z} has eigenvalues m_i * ħ, where m_i can be -l to +l in integer steps. So for each electron, l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So L_{1z} eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, +ħ, same for L_{2z}.

But wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total M (which is the sum of m1 and m2) is -1. Because M is the eigenvalue for the total L_z operator, which is L_{1z} + L_{2z
