Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond and a conjugate base, usually resulting in a resonance-stabilized intermediate like an enolate.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options given.

Let's start with the first part, (A): dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I think sodium ethoxide is a strong base and a good nucleophile, acting as a catalyst or maybe deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. It can act as the nucleophile in the Michael addition. The other reactant, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 2.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from the nucleophile) attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. Wait, no, wait. The nucleophile is the enolate, right? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no: in a Michael addition, the nucleophile (like the enolate from dimethyl malonate) attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, no, actually, the Michael donor is the enolate (or similar nucleophile), and the Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So in this case, dimethyl malonate (which is a diester) can form an enolate, which would then attack the β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

So the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO2R. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the CH2 part? Wait, no. Let me get this right.

The structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate group is CH2=CHCO-OCH3. But the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, no. No, wait—acrylate is CH2=CHCO2Me. So the 3-position would be the CH2 part. Wait, maybe I should draw this.
