Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is about how long it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III stops, that means the neutrinos from that reaction wouldn't reach us anymore. But what does this mean for the neutrino flux we detect?

The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the pp-III branch contributes to these bands and what the ratio would be without it.

Wait, I remember that the pp chain is the dominant process in the Sun's core, producing a lot of energy. The pp-III branch is a part of that. I think the pp chain produces neutrinos via the proton-proton reactions, specifically the ppI and ppII branches, and then the ppIII is maybe a different part? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Oh wait, the main neutrino production in the Sun comes from the pep reaction (proton-electron-proton) and the dominant ppI reaction. The ppIII is another branch but less significant perhaps?

Wait no, maybe the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton chain. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think. The proton-proton chain produces helium, and in doing so emits neutrinos. The dominant process is the ppI branch, and there's also the pep branch, which is a minor contributor. Oh wait, maybe the question refers to the pep reaction as part of the pp chain. Or perhaps
