Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable based on the given conditions. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, what do I remember about ESPRESSO? I think it's a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets, I believe, by measuring the Doppler shift in star spectra. But in this question, the key thing is about the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) that the spectrograph can achieve.

The question states that a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of the listed stars meet this criterion.

Looking at the options, they are stars a) to f), each with different characteristics. Let me list them:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with V=15 mag, 10 pc away
d) Same V magnitude, 200 pc
e) Same V mag, 5 pc
f) Same V mag, 50 pc

Wait, but what's the absolute magnitude here? The options c, d, e, f all have Absolute V magnitude of 15. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs. So their apparent magnitude (how bright they appear to us) depends on their distance.

I remember that the formula to calculate apparent magnitude (m) from absolute magnitude (M) is m = M + 5 log (d / 10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for each of these, I'll calculate their apparent magnitude. The stars with lower apparent magnitudes (brighter) will be easier to detect because they have higher flux, leading to higher S/N ratios in the spectrograph.

But how does the S/N relate to the star's brightness? ESPRESSO's S/N depends on the star's flux. I think the more flux (brighter star), the higher the S/N achieved in a given exposure time.

I think the formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) ) / noise. But perhaps for this problem, there's a standard way to determine whether the star is bright enough based on its apparent magnitude.

Wait, the ESPRESS
