Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Maxwell's equations, but I'll try to think it through.

So, in our universe, one of Maxwell's key equations is that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. That's because, as far as we know, you can't have isolated north or south poles—they always come in pairs. So ∇·B = 0. But the question says in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles. That must mean that the divergence of B isn't zero anymore.

Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me list them out as I remember:

1. Gauss's Law: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. That's about electric fields and charge distribution.
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0. As I thought, which would change here.
3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This deals with changing magnetic fields and induced electric fields.
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. This is about how magnetic fields are generated by currents and changing electric fields.

So, if the universe allows isolated magnetic poles, that affects the magnetic Gauss's law. So equation 2 would change. But wait, what about the other equations? If equation 2 changes, what happens to the others?

In our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0. If in this universe that's not the case, maybe equation 2 becomes ∇·B = some rho_m (like a magnetic charge density). So equation 2 is definitely different.

But the question is about which equations are different. The options mention different combinations of Maxwell's equations. Let me look at the options:

Option A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. Oh, that's equation 2. So option A says only that equation is different. But wait, are there any others?

Wait, another thought. If magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect other equations? Let me think about Ampère's Law. Ampère's Law in our universe doesn't involve magnetic charge because the divergence of B is zero. If that isn't the case anymore, would Ampère's Law also change?

Hmm, wait. Ampère's Law is ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). If B has sources (like divergence not zero), then maybe there's an additional term in Ampère's Law as well. Or perhaps Faraday's Law might have a term. Let me think.

Wait, in the case of magnetic monopoles, the modification affects two of Maxwell's equations. Because if B has a divergence (i.e., sources and sinks), then Faraday's Law might get a term too. Because in our universe, Faraday's Law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. But if B has a divergence, maybe there could be a term involving the time derivative of the magnetic charge density or something.

Wait, no, let me think more carefully. In our universe, magnetic monopoles aren't a thing, so equation 2 is
