Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again. Hmm. It's about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon and the distance to the galaxy, and I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

Wait, the event horizon's angular size is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. The entropy, right. I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. So the formula is S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon.

But wait, A is the area, so for a black hole, the area depends on the Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is (2 G M)/(c²), right? So A would be 4π R_s². Which makes A = 16 π² G² M² / c^4. Or wait, let me get that right. R_s is 2 G M / c², so R_s squared is (4 G² M²)/(c^4). Then A = 4π * (4 G² M²)/(c^4) = 16 π G² M² / c^4. Oh wait, no, wait. 4 pi R^2, and R is 2 G M / c². So R squared is 4 G² M²
