Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of pH calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says I have three solutions mixed together: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, with some numbers given, so I'm guessing it's a matter of calculating which one matches.

Hmm, wait, so CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I should figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each component:

1. For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Molarity (M) = moles / liters. So moles = M * volume in liters.
Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M.
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely, but I think for the purpose of neutralization, we can consider it as a source of H+ ions. So, 0.05 moles of H+ from acetic acid.

Wait, but wait a minute. Actually, since acetic acid is weak, it doesn't completely donate H+ ions. But in the presence of a strong acid (HCl) and a strong base (Ba(OH)2), the H+ from acetic acid might be negligible compared to the strong acid and base. But I'm not sure, maybe I should treat it as a weak acid and see how it reacts with the strong base.

But let's proceed. Next, the HCl:

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Each mole of HCl gives 1 mole of H+.

Volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Molarity is 0.2 M.
Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. So 0.08 moles H+.

Now Ba(OH)2: it's a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-.

Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each gives 2 OH-, moles of OH- = 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when we mix acids and bases, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl, and the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in solution, it doesn't contribute as much H+ as a strong acid. However, when we mix all solutions, the strong HCl will donate a lot of H+, and the strong base will donate a lot of OH-.

So the first step is to calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids and the total moles of OH- from the base.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it
