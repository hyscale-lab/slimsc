Okay, so there's this question about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

So the question says that a supernova occurs in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, okay, so each frame is moving relative to the other. Since they're both inertial frames, we can probably use the concept of relative velocity and maybe some time dilation or length contraction from special relativity. But wait, I'm not sure if that's needed here. Let me think.

In the galaxy's frame: the ejecta is moving towards the center at some velocity. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, perhaps we can find the ejecta's velocity in the galaxy's frame using the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, right. Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(cÂ²)), but wait, I might be mixing up the frames
