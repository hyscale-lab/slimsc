Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency for the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is a way to determine the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index. So, the formula for calculating it is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H the hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But wait, since the product doesn't have any nitrogens or halogens mentioned, I can ignore X and N here.

So, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure in my mind. It's a cyclohexene ring. The numbering goes from 1 to 6. At position 3, there's a double bond (so that's one double bond). Position 2 has a formyl group (-CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (which is a CH2-CH2 but with a double bond, so that's another double bond). Also, at position 1 (since it's a cyclohexene carboxylic acid), there's a COOH group.

Wait, the structure would be:
- Cyclohexene ring (so one double bond already)
- At C2: -CHO (so a carbonyl group)
- At C5: a vinyl group, which is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond (so that's another double bond)
Wait, or is it a substituent that's a vinyl group as in CH2=CH- attached to the ring? So, the substituent itself has a double bond.

So, the starting molecule has:
- One ring (cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond)
- The formyl group has a carbonyl (another double bond)
- The vinyl group has another double bond

So, initial DoU for the starting material
