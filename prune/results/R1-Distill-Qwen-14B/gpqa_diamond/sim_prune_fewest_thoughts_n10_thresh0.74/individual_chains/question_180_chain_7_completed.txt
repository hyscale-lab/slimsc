Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

There's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy, I think.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, so I'm guessing this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Since all the charges are the same, it's going to be a matter of calculating the potential energy between each pair.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P, so each of the 12 charges at 2 meters away will have potential energy due to their interaction with the fixed charge. Also, the 12 charges are each at a fixed distance from P, but are they fixed relative to each other? The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other might not be specified. Oh wait, but if they're all at 2 m from P, and the system is isolated, their arrangement might affect the potential energy between them. But wait, the problem says each of the 12 is at 2 m from P. So maybe they're arranged in a symmetric way, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can treat them as being fixed in space relative to each other.

Wait, but no, the problem is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when all the 12 charges are as far apart as possible, but that's probably not the case here. Wait, no, in an isolated system, the potential energy is determined by all the interactions between the charges. Since all charges are the same, each pair contributes to the total potential energy.

Wait, but the charges all have the same sign, right? 2e each. So each pair will repel each other. So the potential energy between each pair is positive because like charges repel, so their potential energy is positive. Therefore, the total potential energy of the system is the sum of all pairwise potentials.

But wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. Wait, but wait, the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, but are they allowed to move relative to each other? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps their positions relative to each other can vary, but each is at 2m from P. So the distance between any two of them could vary. So to find the minimum energy, we need to arrange them in a way that minimizes the total potential energy.

But wait, each of the 12 charges is identical, so arranging them all symmetrically would probably give the minimum potential energy. Because when like charges are arranged as far apart as possible, the potential energy is minimized. Wait, but no, that's for the case of fixed charges where the distance between each pair is the same. Wait, but in reality, the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where r is the distance between them.

So for 12 charges arranged at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. But to minimize the total potential energy, we want to maximize the distances between each pair, because that would make each term in the sum as small as possible (since U is positive, smaller when r is larger). So arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the sum.

Wait, but wait. The system is isolated, so the charges can't move beyond their constraints. Each of the 12 charges is fixed at 2m from P. So perhaps they're arranged on a sphere of radius 2m around P. To minimize the potential energy, they should be as far apart as possible, which would be placing them as far apart as possible on the sphere. But the exact arrangement isn't given, so perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at a distance of 2m from each other as well. Or perhaps not. Hmm.

Wait, no, that's probably not the case. The 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. For example, if they are all on the same point, the distance between any two would be zero, but since they're point charges, that's impossible. But in reality, when you have multiple charges on a sphere, the distances between them vary. But calculating the exact potential in that case would be complicated. So perhaps the problem is simplifying things by assuming that each of the 12 charges only interacts with the central charge at P, and not with each other. But that doesn't make sense because the potential between the 12 charges would also contribute.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimal energy occurs when the 12 charges are arranged such that the mutual potential energies are as small as possible. Since all the charges are positive, the potential between any two is positive, so to minimize the total energy, we want to minimize the sum of these positive terms. So that would mean arranging them as far apart as possible, which would minimize each individual term.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies are negligible compared to the potential between each of the 12 charges and the central charge. Or perhaps, for the sake of the problem, we're just considering the potential between the 12 charges and the central one, but not their mutual interactions. But that seems unlikely because the mutual interactions are part of the system's potential energy.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energies are zero. But wait, that's not possible because the charges are all positive. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are ignored, but that would depend on the setup.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and not the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. That would make the problem easier. Let me think: each of the 12 charges at 2m from P, so each contributes an energy of (k * q1 * q2) / r, where q1 is 2e and q2 is 2e. Wait, no—wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so it has charge 2e. Each of the 12 charges has charge 2e and is at a distance of 2m from P.

So the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge is U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). So for each of the 12, that's U_i = (k * (2e)^2) / 2. Summing all 12, the total energy would be 12 * U_i = 12 * (k * (4e²) ) / 2 = 12 * (2 k e²) ) = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait. Potential energy in electrostatics is a bit tricky. Because when you have multiple charges, you have to consider that adding a charge moves the others. But in this problem, since the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, perhaps each of their contributions is independent. But for the entire system, when you add each charge one by one, the potential energy adds up, but each new charge affects the potential for the others. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12. So each of the 12 contributes (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). So 12 times that.

Wait, but the potential energy of the system is the sum of all pairwise interactions. So that would include the interactions between the 12 charges as well as their interactions with the central charge.

Hmm, that complicates things. But perhaps the question is simplified by assuming that the 12 charges are far apart from each other compared to 2m, so their mutual potential energies are negligible. Or perhaps the problem only considers the interaction between each of the 12 and the central charge, and ignores the mutual interactions. Let's see.

The problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the mutual potential energies are minimized. That would happen when the charges are as far apart as possible. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the central charge's contributions. Let's proceed under that assumption for now, and see if the answer matches one of the options.

So, each of the 12 charges has a charge of 2e, and is at a distance of 2m from the central charge of 2e.

The potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r.

So for each pair, U = (9e9 N·m²/C²) * (2e) * (2e) / (2 meters).

Wait, e is the elementary charge, 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

So let's compute this.

First, (2e) * (2e) = 4 e². e is 1.602e-19 C, so e² is (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

So 4 e² ≈ 1.026e-37 C².

Then, U per pair is (9e9) * (1.026e-37) / 2.

Wait, 9e9 * 1.026e-37 = approximately 9 * 1.026 = 9.234, so 9.234e-28.

Divide by 2 meters: 9.234e-28 / 2 ≈ 4.617e-28 J.

But wait, that's per pair. Since there are 12 such pairs (each of the 12 charges with the central one), the total would be 12 * 4.617e-28 ≈ 5.54e-27 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 7e-27. Hmm, that's not matching. Let me do more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute (2e) * (2e) = 4 e² = 4*(1.602e-19)^2 = 4*(2.566e-38) = 1.0264e-37 C².

Then, U for one pair: (9e9) * (1.0264e-37) / 2.

Compute numerator: 9e9 * 1.0264e-37 = 9 * 1.0264 = 9.2376, so 9.2376e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6188e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.6188e-28 * 12 = 5.54256e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest to 5.54e-27 is option C, which is 7.056e-27. But that's off. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I forgot to account for something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges also has potential energy due to their interactions with each other. But that would add more energy, making the total higher.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps when the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual potential energy is as small as possible. But since all charges are positive, arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize each pair's contribution, but they can't all be infinitely far apart. So perhaps the minimal mutual potential energy is when the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are maximized, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal energy comes only from the central charge's interactions, and the mutual interactions are considered to be zero or somehow not contributing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, considering only their interaction with the central charge. But then, the energy I calculated earlier was around 5.5e-27 J, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options again:

Options:

A) 5.645 x10^-26

B) 2.822 x10^-26

C) 7.056 x10^-27

D) 122.330

Hmm. Wait, 5.5e-27 is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I forgot that the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So the product is (2e)(2e) = 4e², which I have. But wait, the potential energy between two charges is k*(q1 q2)/r, but when calculating the system's potential energy, each pair is counted once. So for 12 charges, each interacting with the central charge, that's 12 pairs. But in the total potential energy, each pair is only counted once. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the arithmetic.

Compute 4e²: 4*(1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 4: 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37.

Then, U = (9e9) * (1.0264e-37) / (2).

Compute 9e9 * 1.0264e-37: 9 * 1.0264 = 9.2376, so 9.2376e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6188e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.6188e-28 * 12 = 5.54256e-27 J.

Hmm, so that's about 5.54e-27 J.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. The closest is option C: 7.056e-27. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in considering the number of interactions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering all possible pairs in the system, including the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. So the system's total potential energy is the sum of all possible pairs:

- The 12 charges each interacting with the central charge: 12 pairs.

- The 12 charges interacting with each other: C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

So total pairs: 12 + 66 = 78.

Each of these pairs contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r_i, where r_i is the distance between the i-th pair.

But without knowing the r_i, it's impossible to calculate. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are 2m as well. That is, each of the 12 charges is at 2m from both the central charge and each other. But that's not physically possible unless they're all at the same point, which can't be the case because they're point charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is 2m from the central charge and also 2m from each other. But wait, in three-dimensional space, how can 12 charges each be 2m from each other and the center? That's impossible because in three dimensions, the maximum number of equidistant points from a center is 12 for a regular icosahedron, but each point is at the same distance from the center. However, their distances from each other would vary. So perhaps the mutual distances are larger than 2m, but without knowing the exact arrangement, we can't compute their exact contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the 12 charges and the central one, ignoring the mutual interactions between the 12. So the total potential energy is just the sum of the 12 interactions, which gives about 5.54e-27 J. But none of the options match that.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5.54e-27 * 5, not sure. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times larger than my previous calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 4e². Let me double-check that.

(2e) * (2e) =4 e². e is 1.602176634e-19 C.

So e² is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

4e² = 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.026e-37 C².

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 2 meters, so when I divide by r=2, that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the central charge is fixed, and the other 12 are all 2m from it, but the mutual distances are considered to be 2m as well. So each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the center and 2m from each other. But that's not possible in 3D space. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are also 2m. But that would mean each charge is 2m from the center and each other, which would require a regular icosahedron arrangement, but even then, mutual distances vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the central charge, and the mutual distances are at 4m, but that's assuming they're diametrically opposite, which isn't possible with 12 charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at a mutual distance of 2m. But again, that's not possible in 3D.

Hmm. Maybe I should think differently. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and that's it.

Wait, but 12 charges each contribute U = (k * (2e)^2)/ (2m) ) = (k *4 e²) / (2m).

So for each, U = (k *4 e² ) / (2 * 2) )? Wait, no, the distance is 2m, so it's 4e² * k / 2.

Wait, let me compute the value more precisely.

Compute 4e²:

4 * (1.602e-19 C)^2 = 4 * (2.566e-38) = 1.026e-37 C².

So for each of the 12 charges:

U = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (1.026e-37 C²) / (2 m).

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 = (8.988 * 1.026) * 1e-28.

8.988 *1.026 ≈ 9.236.

So 9.236e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.618e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 4.618e-28 *12 = 5.542e-27 J.

So approximately 5.54e-27 J. Looking at the options, the closest is option C (7.056e-27), but that's about 1.27 times larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it again.

Compute k * (2e)^2 / r.

Wait, k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e) = 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.265e-38 C².

So each U = (8.988e9) * (10.265e-38) / (2 m).

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38 = (8.988 *10.265) * 1e-28.

8.988 *10 ≈89.88, 8.988 *0.265≈ 2.38. So total ≈92.26.

So 92.26e-28 =9.226e-27.

Divide by 2 m: 4.613e-27 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.613e-27 *12 =5.5356e-27 J.

So that's about 5.536e-27 J. Again, the same result.

But none of the options match. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge contributes to the potential of the others. So when you add the first charge, it doesn't contribute to any potential. The second charge has a potential due to the first and the central charge. Hmm, but no, that's a different approach. Let me think about that.

In reality, the total potential energy U of a system of charges is the sum over all pairs. So for each pair, you calculate their potential energy and sum them all.

In this case, we have 13 charges: 1 fixed at P, 12 fixed at 2m from P. Let's denote the central charge as Q (2e), and the 12 surrounding as q1, q2, ..., q12 (each 2e).

Each q_i interacts with Q, contributing U_i = k*(2e * 2e)/(2m) = (k *4e²)/(2m).

So each U_i = (k *4e²) / (2m) = (2k e²)/m.

Wait, no: 4/(2) =2, so U_i = (2 k e²) / m. Wait, m is 2 meters, so:

U_i = (2 * k * e²) / 2 = k e².

So each U_i = k e².

Wait, let me see:

k is 8.988e9.

e is 1.602e-19.

So e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = approximately 2.3e-28.

Wait, 8.988e9 is about 9e9, 9e9 * 2.566e-38 is 2.309e-28.

So each U_i is 2.309e-28 J.

Total for 12 charges: 12 * 2.309e-28 ≈ 2.771e-27 J.

Wait, that's about 2.77e-27 J. But again, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it precisely.

Compute each U_i:

k * (2e)^2 / (2m) = (8.988e9) * ( (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e² =4*(1.602e-19)^2 =4*(2.566e-38)=1.026e-37.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / (2).

= (8.988e9 *1.026e-37 ) / 2.

8.988e9 *1.026e-37 = (8.988 *1.026) *1e-28.

8.988 *1.026 ≈9.236.

So 9.236e-28. Divided by 2, 4.618e-28 J per U_i.

12 *4.618e-28 =5.541e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are each at a mutual distance of 2m from each other as well, which would be a different calculation. But that would require a specific arrangement, like 12 points on a sphere, each 2m from the center and each adjacent point 2m apart. But in reality, arranging 12 points on a sphere with each pair 2m apart is impossible because the sphere's radius would have to be larger than 2m for all points to be 2m apart. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are considered to be the same as the distance from the center, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, but I'm missing a factor. For example, perhaps I should multiply by the number of interactions, which is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential energy is actually the sum of all pairs, including the central charge and the 12, and all the 12's mutual interactions.

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the mutual interactions are zero. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are neglected, making the total energy just the sum from the central charge.

But even so, the calculated value doesn't match any option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the charges are electrons, but the problem says 'each with charge 2e'. So they're not electrons, but particles with charge twice the elementary charge.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of the others. So when you place the first charge, it doesn't contribute to any potential. The second charge contributes to the potential due to the first charge and the central charge. Wait, no, that's not the standard way to calculate potential energy. The system's potential energy is the sum of all pairs, regardless of the order in which you place them.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant. Some sources use k = 9e9 N·m²/C², others use more precise values like 8.988e9. Maybe that's the issue.

Let me recalculate using k =9e9.

So U_i = (9e9) * (2e * 2e) / (2m).

=9e9 *4e² / 2.

= (9e9 *4e²) /2.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

4e²=1.026e-37.

So 9e9 *1.026e-37 =9.234e-28.

Divide by 2, 4.617e-28.

Multiply by 12, 5.54e-27.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the energy in a different unit, but the options are in Joules, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as if the 12 charges are arranged in a way where each is 2m from the center and 2m from each other. So each mutual distance is 2m.

Wait, that would require each pair of the 12 charges to be 2m apart, which would form a regular structure, but 12 points on a sphere can't all be 2m apart from each other. So that's not possible. So the mutual distances would be larger than 2m.

Wait, but for the sake of calculation, if we assume that each pair of the 12 charges is 2m apart, then each mutual pair contributes U = (k*(2e)^2)/2.

So each mutual pair contributes (9e9 * (4e²) ) / 2 = 9e9 *4e² / 2 = same as before, 1.8e9 *4e².

Wait, no. Let's compute it:

(9e9) * (4e²) / 2.

4e² =1.026e-37.

So 9e9 *1.026e-37 =9.234e-28.

Divide by 2:4.617e-28 J per mutual pair.

There are C(12,2)=66 mutual pairs.

So mutual energy:66 *4.617e-28 =3.047e-26 J.

Plus the energy from the central charge:5.54e-27 J.

Total energy:3.047e-26 +5.54e-27= approximately 3.6e-26 J.

But the options don't have this either. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 5.6e-26. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential of the others, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying by considering only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, and not the mutual potentials. So the answer would be around 5.5e-27 J, but the options don't have that.

Looking at the options again:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times the 5.5e-27 I calculated. Could I have missed a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I forgot that the potential energy between two charges is the same regardless of the order (i.e., q1 and q2 contribute the same as q2 and q1), but in the sum, each pair is only counted once. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are off.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Wait, maybe the central charge is being considered as fixed, and the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at 2m from the center, but their mutual distances are at a much larger distance, making their mutual potential energies negligible. So the total potential energy is just from the central charge.

But that would give 5.5e-27 J, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 12 * (k * (2e)^2) / (2m).

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e². So 12 * (k *4e²)/(2m) =12 * (2k e²)/(m).

Wait, m=2m? No, m is 2 meters. So 12 * (2k e²)/(2) ) =12 * k e².

Ah, wait, that's 12 * k e².

k is approximately 9e9, e is 1.6e-19.

So 12 *9e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute that.

(1.6e-19)^2 =2.56e-38.

9e9 *2.56e-38 =2.304e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.304e-28 *12 =2.7648e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.76e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 12 * (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m).

k=8.988e9.

(2e)^2=4e²=4*(1.602e-19)^2=4*2.566e-38=1.026e-37.

So, U =12 * (8.988e9 *1.026e-37) / (2*2).

Wait, 2*2 is 4 meters? No, the distance is 2m, so denominator is 2 meters.

Wait, no: the denominator is r=2 m.

So U=12 * (8.988e9 *1.026e-37) / 2.

Wait, 8.988e9 *1.026e-37 =9.234e-28.

Divide by 2:4.617e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.54e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. The options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: the problem states that the system is isolated. So the charges can move, but the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps the minimal energy occurs when the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy, which would be when all the 12 charges are as far apart as possible.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 charges placed in a way that each is 2m from P and at a mutual distance of 2m as well, but that's impossible in 3D. So perhaps the mutual distances are larger, but without knowing, the mutual potential energies would be smaller than if they were all at 2m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energies are zero, which is impossible because the charges are all positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are considered to be zero because the charges are in a state where they're arranged symmetrically, but that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the system's energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials. So that includes the 12 interactions with the central charge and the 66 mutual interactions.

But without the mutual distances, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are much larger than 2m, making their contributions negligible. So the total energy is just the sum from the central charge, which is 5.54e-27 J. But that's not an option.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option C is 7.056e-27. Let me compute 7.056e-27 divided by 5.54e-27. That's approximately 1.27. So perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 4 meters instead of 2 meters? Let me see.

If the distance were 4m, then U_i = k*(4e²)/(4) = (k *4e²)/4 = k e².

Which would be 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Which is 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 2.304e-28 J per U_i.

Multiply by 12:2.7648e-27 J, which is about 2.76e-27 J. Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for e, like 1.6e-19 instead of 1.602e-19. Let me try that.

e =1.6e-19.

e²=2.56e-38.

So U_i = (9e9)*(4e²)/(2).

4e²=4 *2.56e-38=1.024e-37.

9e9 *1.024e-37 =9.216e-28.

Divide by 2:4.608e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.5296e-27 J.

Still around 5.53e-27.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the central charge, but the central charge is also moving. But no, the problem says the 13th charge is fixed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the work done in assembling the system. So when you bring in each charge, the potential energy increases by the potential at that point due to the existing charges.

So for the first charge, you bring it from infinity to 2m from P. The potential at that point is due to the central charge, which is (k * 2e)/(2m). So the work done is (2e)*(V), where V is the potential due to the central charge.

Wait, the potential at 2m from the central charge is V = k*(2e)/(2m) = k e / m.

So when bringing in the first surrounding charge, the work done is (2e) * V = 2e*(k e / m) = 2 k e² / m.

Then, when bringing in the second charge, the potential at that point is due to the central charge and the first charge. So the potential is k*(2e)/(2m) + k*(2e)/(r), where r is the distance between the first and second charge. If all surrounding charges are at the same 2m radius, the distance between any two is determined by the arrangement.

Assuming they're arranged symmetrically, the distance between any two charges on the sphere of radius 2m would be r = 2 * 2 * sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that the distance between any two surrounding charges is 2m. But that can't be, because on a sphere, the distance between two points at the same radius would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are 2m, which would require a regular icosahedron arrangement, but even then, the distances between adjacent vertices are longer than 2m.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved by only considering the central charge's interactions, and the mutual interactions are considered negligible, perhaps because the charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are much larger than 2m, making their contributions small compared to the central charge's.

In that case, the total potential energy would be approximately 5.54e-27 J, which doesn't match any option. But the options provided don't include this value.

Wait, let me look at option C:7.056e-27. Let me compute what would give that.

If 12 * (k * (2e)^2)/r =7.056e-27.

So (k *4e²) *12 / r =7.056e-27.

k=9e9, e=1.6e-19.

4e²=4*(1.6e-19)^2=4*2.56e-38=1.024e-37.

So 12 *9e9 *1.024e-37 / r =7.056e-27.

Compute 12 *9e9 =1.08e11.

1.08e11 *1.024e-37 =1.1059e-26.

Divide by r equals 7.056e-27.

So r= (1.1059e-26) / (7.056e-27) )= approximately 1.567 meters.

But the problem states that the distance is 2m. So this doesn't make sense. So perhaps the calculation isn't right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential of the others, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for gravitational potential energy, but that's a stretch because the problem is about electric charges.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of the others, leading to an additional factor. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a dipole or something else. But that doesn't fit here.

Hmm. At this point, I'm a bit stuck. I've tried multiple approaches but none seem to align with the given options. However, perhaps I made a mistake in considering only the central charge's interactions. Let me try another approach.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the sum of all pairwise potentials. So that includes:

- The 12 charges each interacting with the central charge (12 interactions).

- Each of the 12 charges interacting with each of the other 11 (66 interactions).

So the total U is U_central + U_mutual.

If I can compute U_mutual, perhaps it adds up to one of the options.

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are 2m, which would be incorrect. But let's proceed.

So U_mutual = sum over all 66 pairs of (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij.

If each r_ij is 2m, then U_mutual =66 * (k *4e²)/(2m).

Which is 66*(9e9 *4e²)/(2 *2).

Wait, 4e² is 1.026e-37.

So 9e9 *1.026e-37 =9.234e-28.

Divide by 4 (since 2*2) m: 9.234e-28 /4=2.3085e-28.

Multiply by 66:66 *2.3085e-28=1.523e-26 J.

Then, U_central is 12*(k *4e²)/(2*2) =12*(9e9 *4e²)/(4).

=12*(9e9 *4e²)/4.

=12*(9e9 *1.026e-37)/2.

Wait, no:

Wait, U_central is 12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Which is 12*(9e9 *1.026e-37)/2.

Which is 12*(4.617e-28) =5.54e-27 J.

So total U =1.523e-26 +5.54e-27 =2.077e-26 J.

But the options don't have this either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distances are 4m, so r=4m.

Then U_mutual=66*(9e9 *4e²)/(4*2).

Wait, no. Let me correct.

If each mutual distance is 4m, then U_mutual=66*(9e9 *4e²)/(4).

Which is 66*(9e9 *1.026e-37)/1.

Compute 9e9 *1.026e-37=9.234e-28.

Multiply by 66: 6.09e-26 J.

Plus U_central=5.54e-27 J.

Total U=6.09e-26 +5.54e-27=6.644e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 1m, making the mutual energy larger.

But this is getting too time-consuming, and I think I'm not making progress. Given the options, perhaps the intended approach is to calculate only the central charge's interactions, which gives 5.54e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at a mutual distance of 2m. So each of the 66 mutual pairs contributes (9e9 *4e²)/(2).

So U_mutual=66*(9e9 *4e²)/(2).

Compute 9e9 *4e²=9e9 *1.026e-37=9.234e-28.

Divide by 2:4.617e-28.

Multiply by 66:4.617e-28 *66=3.047e-26 J.

Plus U_central=5.54e-27 J.

Total U=3.047e-26 +5.54e-27=3.601e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 5.6e-26 J. That's about 10 times larger than the 5.5e-27 I calculated earlier.

Hmm. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation that introduced a factor of 10 error? Let me check.

Wait, I think I know where I went wrong. Oh! The problem says each charge is 2e, so the product is (2e)*(2e)=4e². But in Coulomb's law, the product is q1*q2/(4πε₀ r), but sometimes Coulomb's constant k already includes the 1/(4πε₀) term, so k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Wait, no, that's correct. So perhaps another mistake is that I'm using 2e instead of e. Wait, no, the charges are 2e each.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, but each interaction is counted twice. No, in the sum of pairs, each pair is counted once.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 13th charge is also interacting with the other 12, but I'm only counting each once. Which is correct.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess. The closest option to my calculation is option C (7.056e-27), but that's about 1.27 times higher than my result. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the mutual interactions considered, making the total higher.

But without more information, I'll have to proceed with the assumption that the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, but I'm not fully confident.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we analyze the electrostatic potential energy between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from a fixed point \( P \), where the 13th charge resides.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Between the Central Charge and the 12 Charges**:
   - The potential energy between two point charges is given by:
     \[
     U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
     \]
     where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).
   - Substituting \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), we compute:
     \[
     U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{k \cdot (2e)^2}{2} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot (3.204 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2}
     \]
     \[
     U_{\text{pair}} \approx 4.618 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy due to the central charge is:
     \[
     U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot U_{\text{pair}} = 12 \cdot 4.618 \times 10^{-28} \approx 5.542 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges**:
   - The 12 charges are constrained at \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \), but their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. To minimize the total potential energy, the charges should be as far apart as possible. However, without explicit information about their arrangement, it is challenging to compute the exact mutual potential energy. For simplicity, the problem likely assumes that the mutual interactions are negligible compared to the energy from the central charge.

3. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated energy due to the central charge is approximately \( 5.54 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). However, this value does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - Option \( C \) (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)) is the closest to the calculated value. It is approximately \( 1.27 \times 5.54 \times 10^{-27} \), suggesting a possible discrepancy in the problem setup or assumptions.

### Conclusion:
Given the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is \( C \), as it is the closest to the computed value and aligns with the assumption that the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the energy from the central charge.
