Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at a specific wavelength. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. 

Wait, the question says these clouds absorb light from background quasars at that wavelength. So the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen clouds in front of it absorb some of that light, especially the Lyman-alpha emission. But wait, if the cloud is at a high redshift, the wavelength we observe it at would be stretched due to the expansion of the universe.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't observe in the ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs those wavelengths. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range (which telescopes can see), the wavelength must have been redshifted into the optical part of the spectrum.

So the Lyman-alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers (since 1 Angstrom is 0.01 micrometers). Optical wavelengths are roughly between 0.4 and 0.7 micrometers. So the absorbed wavelength needs to shift into this range.

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength)/rest wavelength. So if the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms (0.1216 micrometers), and the observed wavelength needs to be within 0.4 micrometers (since that's the start of optical), let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because ground-based telescopes can observe only up to about 0.7 micrometers in the optical. So for the Lyman-alpha line to be observed in the optical, it has to be redshifted to at least 0.4 micrometers? Or wait, no. Because the quasar's own light is being absorbed by the hydrogen. So the quasar's emission is, I think, in the optical, but the Lyman-alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms. But when the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, the absorption line would be in the rest frame of the cloud. So wait, maybe I'm
