Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with a specific compound and going through several steps to form a final product. The goal is to determine how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. 

First, I'll try to understand each step of the reaction. Let me start by breaking down the compounds and reactions involved.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a mouthful. I know that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So this molecule has a bicyclic structure with substituents. The tert-butoxy group is attached at position 7. The structure should look something like norbornene (but with two double bonds, since it's diene) and a tert-butoxy group at a specific position.

Next, the reaction combines this compound with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, I think. The dibromomethyl groups are on the cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those groups has two bromine atoms attached to a methyl group.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have two CH2Br2 groups attached to carbons 5 and 6 of the cyclohexadiene. So when this reacts with the starting norbornene compound, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of addition or coupling reaction.

I remember that when dienes react with dienophiles in a Diels-Alder reaction, but wait, that's usually a [4+2] cycloaddition. But here, the starting material has two double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition reaction where the dienophile is the norbornene part.

Wait, but the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which has two double bonds. So perhaps each double bond can react with the dienophile. But wait, the other compound has two dibromomethyl groups on the
