Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and think about what each part means.

The question says that an unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Hmm, I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Also, two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Oh, those are probably carbonyl groups. The 1700 could be a ketone or an ester, and the 1650 might be conjugated or an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, like maybe an aromatic ester or something like that.

Then the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, so probably some kind of alkene is present. That makes me think of structures with double bonds, like an ester maybe, or perhaps a ketone with an adjacent double bond. Wait, but if it's an ester, the carbonyl is at 1700ish, which fits.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to connect that with possible structures. I remember that m/z 45 is significant for certain functional groups. For example, the fragment could be a ketene group (like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 could be the mass of a CH₂O group, which is 12+2+16=30? No, wait, wait. Wait, 45 is the mass of CH3CO (which is 29?), no. Wait, let me calculate: 12 (C) + 2*1 (H2) + 16 (O) = 30. No, that's for CH2O. Wait, another possibility: maybe the fragment is an acetyl group (CH3CO), but that would be 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16) = 24 +3 +16=43. Hmm, not 45. Wait, maybe it's the fragment from an ester group. Esters break into the R-O and the R-O-CO-R' part. Another thought: 45 could be the mass of (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Acetone's molecular weight is 58 (12*3 +1*6 +16*1= 36 +6 +16=58), so a fragment wouldn't be 45. Maybe it's a different group.

Wait, another angle: I've heard that m/z 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but I'm not sure how that would apply here. Alternatively, 45 could be the result of losing a fragment. Let me think about possible structures.

The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. So all are six carbons, varying in H and O counts.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Assuming X and N are zero. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, I'm getting this wrong. Degree of Unsaturation formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for A: (12 +2 -12)/2 = 2/2=1. So one double bond or ring. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So that's accounted for. Also, IR has a carbonyl group (either ester or ketone). So if it's an ester, the formula would have two oxygen atoms, perhaps as O in the ester group. So an ester would be O2, so that fits option A and C.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (12 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. Maybe a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. If there's a carbonyl and a double bond, that would fit. But the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Two carbonyl groups? That would be unusual unless maybe it's an ester and a conjugated double bond, but I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (12+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. Two DoU. So maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But looking at IR, two carbonyl peaks. That could suggest two carbonyl groups, like maybe an ester and a ketone, but that's less likely in a six-carbon molecule. Or perhaps conjugated carbonyls, like an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, maybe a diester or something else.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (12 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. Could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so
