Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that NMR signals give information about the environment of the protons. The triplet and quartet suggest some splitting due to neighboring protons.

So, 0.9 ppm is usually indicative of methyl groups, especially in an alkyl chain. The triplet with 6Hâ€”maybe that's two methyl groups (each with 3H) next to a CH2 group. Because a triplet in NMR often comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, no, a triplet is when a proton is next to a group with two protons. Oh wait, perhaps the methyl groups are next to a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2. Let me think.

Let me think about the possible structure of compound A. The NMR shows 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet. So, 6H might be two CH3 groups, each with 3H. The quartet is 4H, which might be two CH2 groups, each with 2H. So maybe the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2? Or perhaps a branching point.

Wait, another possibility: if the 6H is a triplet, maybe it's two methyl groups (each 3H) attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to another CH2. So like, (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2? No, that would give more protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a neopentyl group or something similar.

Wait, I think I've heard of this before. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H is typical of two equivalent methyl groups next to a CH2. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H would be the CH2 next to those methyl groups. So, (CH3)2CHCH2CH2 might fit, but wait, no, that would be more than 4H. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane structure? No, that might complicate things.
