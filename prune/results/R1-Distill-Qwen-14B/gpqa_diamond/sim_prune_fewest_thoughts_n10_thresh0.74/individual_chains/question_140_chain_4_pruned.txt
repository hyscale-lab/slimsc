Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. When a precipitate G forms, heating it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, so B must be a solid at room temperature. 

Another clue is that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Also, the question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. So, let me break this down.

First, I'll think about what X could be. Since it's a reagent in organic chemistry and reacts with a liquid, maybe something like a strong base or a metal. Wait, the reaction is violent, so maybe a metal reacting with an acid? Like a metal reacting with a liquid acid to produce hydrogen gas.

Wait, but gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule of W must be something where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think: common gases are H2, O2, N2, maybe CO2, but wait, CO2 has a molecule of 1 C and 2 O, so protons would be 6 + 16*2 = 38, but that's the mass; but the number of protons and neutrons in each atom. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think again. For a molecule, the total protons and total neutrons should be equal.

Wait, perhaps it's a molecule like CH4? No, that's a gas but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe H2O? No, because H2O has two H and one O. Let's calculate protons and neutrons in H2O: each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So total protons in H2O: 2 +8=10. Total neutrons:
