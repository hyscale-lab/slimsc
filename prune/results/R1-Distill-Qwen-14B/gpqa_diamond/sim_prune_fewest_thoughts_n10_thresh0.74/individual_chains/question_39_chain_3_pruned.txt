Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves wave functions and normalization. Oh right, because wave functions need to be normalized so that the total probability of finding the particle is 1.

So the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex number, but I think the real part and the imaginary part are the important things. Oh wait, but when calculating probabilities, we take the modulus squared of the wave function, right?

Wait, the problem says that when they measure the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this region. But the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, maybe that's not the case. Maybe the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, but we're given the form in the region where it exists.

Wait, the problem states that the wave function in the part of space where it can exist is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's the expression only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So for x <1 or x>3, the wave function is zero.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm. Wait, imaginary unit i is sqrt(-1), but in the wave function, the coefficient for i is -0.5. So the wave function is a complex number. So Ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i.

But to normalize the wave function, we need to integrate the modulus squared from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

So the modulus squared is Ψ*(x) Ψ(x) where * is the complex conjugate. So Ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, so the conjugate Ψ* is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying Ψ* and Ψ, we get [ (a
