Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a 3-element vector, so it's a 3-dimensional system. I remember that the state vector needs to be normalized because probabilities have to add up to 1. Let me check that. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The squared magnitude would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state is the vector divided by sqrt(6). So |Ïˆ> = 1/sqrt(6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Then there are two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as matrices. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down:

P:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, okay. And Q's matrix is diagonal: 

Q:
Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1

So the eigenvalues for Q are 1, 0, -1. That's helpful.

The question asks: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

Wait, but no, actually, the measurements are done in sequence: first they measure P, then Q. So the first measurement is P, and we want the outcome 0 for P. Then, after that, measure Q and get -1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Do we first measure P, which will collapse the state into an eigenstate of P, and then measure Q on that new state? Or is it the other way around? The question says "measure
