Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field, and then the field changes direction. The problem asks about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment after the field is switched.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know. Spin-1/2 particles have their spin described by the Pauli matrices. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. The particle is initially aligned with the magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. So the initial state must be an eigenstate of Sz, right? Probably either up or down. But since the field is along +Z, the particle's moment would be aligned, so it's the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2, I guess.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. Wait, but when the field is turned off, does that mean the magnetic interaction is zero during that time? Hmm, but in the problem, it's the sudden change of the direction of the magnetic field. So the particle is subjected to a magnetic field along Y now.

The question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. So, when the field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. Initially, the Hamiltonian was proportional to Sz, but after the change, it's proportional to Sy.

So I think this involves finding the time evolution of the expectation value of Sz. The average value oscillates because the state of the system is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will precess, leading to oscillations in the expectation value.

Let me think about the formalism. The Hamiltonian after the change is H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. The energy is given by the Zeeman term: E = -mu · B. So if the magnetic field is along Y, then the Hamiltonian would be H = -gamma B S_y. Because S is the spin operator, and mu is gamma S. Alternatively, maybe it's H = -mu · B = -gamma (S · B). So if B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y.

But units
