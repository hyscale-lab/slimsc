Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule is formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I remember that when alkenes are heated, especially with certain structures, they can undergo elimination reactions, which typically result in the formation of a more substituted double bond, following Zaitsev's rule. Zaitsev's rule says that the more substituted alkene is the major product because it's more stable.

Let me start by drawing the structure of the starting material, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. So, nona-2,6-diene has nine carbons with double bonds at positions 2 and 6. The '5-butylnona' part probably means that there's a butyl group attached at the 5th carbon. Wait, but wait, nona is nine carbons, so positions 1 to 9. So, position 5 is in the middle.

Wait, but the correct way to name it is that the substituent (butyl) is on carbon 5. So the structure is: CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, nona-2,6-diene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃? No, no. Wait, nona-2,6-diene: positions 2 and 6 are double bonds. So structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃? Wait, but that's a single chain with double bonds at 2 and 6. But wait, no, because 2,6-diene would mean double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7. So the structure would be:

Positions:
1: CH3-
2: CH2=
3: CH-
4: CH2-
5: CH2-
6: CH2=
7: CH-
8: CH2-
9: CH3?

Wait, maybe I should write it out. For nona-2,6-diene, the double bonds are at 2 and 6. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3
