Okay, so I need to figure out the starting material for synthesizing 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene using ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Ring-closing metathesis specifically forms a ring by connecting two ends of an alkene chain.

The target molecule is a cyclohexene with substituents. Let me draw its structure. So cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are: at position 3 and 4, two methyl groups, and at position 5, an isopropyl group. So numbering the ring, positions 1 is where the double bond starts, then 2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, the double bond is between 1 and 2? So the ring would look like this: positions 1 (double bond start), 2, 3 (CH2?), 4 (another CH2?), 5 (isopropyl), and then 6. Wait, no, the substituents are at 3,4, and 5. So positions 3 and 4 each have a methyl group, and position 5 has an isopropyl.

So the cyclohexene structure is cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). Now, the ring-closing metathesis typically uses a Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates the breaking and reforming of double bonds. The mechanism usually involves a metal carbene intermediate.

When you're doing ring-closing, you start with a diene (a molecule with two double bonds, or more accurately, two alkenes that can undergo metathesis) and the ends come together to form the ring. Wait, no, actually, for ring-closing, the molecule has two terminal alkenes. The catalyst will cause the alkenes to exchange partners, effectively connecting the two ends to form the ring.

So, the starting material would be a diene with substituents arranged in such a way that upon metathesis, the ring forms correctly with the substituents in the right positions.

Let me think about the positions. The target is a six-membered ring, so the starting material must have two double bonds separated by
