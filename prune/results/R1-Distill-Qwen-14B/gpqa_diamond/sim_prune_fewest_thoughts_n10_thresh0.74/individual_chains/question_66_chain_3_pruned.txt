Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries means. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, including time and space. So Poincare implies Lorentz symmetry, right? Because without Lorentz invariance, Poincare wouldn't hold. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz. But does the opposite hold? Well, Lorentz is a subset of Poincare, so if an operator respects Lorentz, it doesn't necessarily respect Poincare unless it also has translation invariance.

Now, the question is about SMEFT operators. SMEFT is the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which includes all possible operators that can be added without violating certain symmetries. I think the SMEFT is built by considering all possible operators that are compatible with the symmetries of the Standard Model.

The Standard Model has several symmetries, including Lorentz, gauge (like SU(2), SU(3), U(1)), and also C, P, T symmetries, though not all are respected in the same way. For example, the SM is not C or P symmetric on its own because of things like CKM phase, but it does respect CP in some cases, though there are CP-violating processes.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. SMEFT as an effective theory should respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. Because it's an effective theory that incorporates the SM, so any operator added must not break the SM's symmetries. So, the operators must be invariant under the SM's gauge symmetries, Lorentz symmetry, and also CPT symmetry.

Wait, but what about Poincare? Because the SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and if SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, then it's automatically Poincare-invariant? Or not necessarily? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation
