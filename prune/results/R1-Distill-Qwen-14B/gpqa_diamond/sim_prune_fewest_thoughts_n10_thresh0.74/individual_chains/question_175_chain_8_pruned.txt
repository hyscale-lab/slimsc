Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, and the symmetry axis is along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and also figure out what form f has.

I remember that for dipole radiation, the power pattern has a specific angular dependence. Wait, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the square of the dipole moment and the frequency, but more importantly, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is the radiation zone here) depends on the angle θ.

The power per unit solid angle, or the radiation intensity, for a dipole is given by something like I = (something) * (1 + cos²θ) / (sin^4θ). Wait, no, wait. Oh right, I think the intensity for a dipole varies as (sin²θ) or something like that. Wait, no, no. Let me think. The radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis, right? So the intensity should be maximum at θ = 90 degrees.

Wait, let me recall the exact expression. The radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²θ). Because when θ is 0 (along the dipole axis), the intensity is 2 times the minimum, but wait, the maximum is at θ = 90 degrees where 1 + cos²θ = 2... Wait, is that correct? Or is it that the intensity is proportional to (1 + cos²θ)? Hmm. So, for θ = 0, the intensity is 2, and for θ = 90 degrees, it's 2 as well. Wait no, wait, when θ=0, cosθ=1, so 1 + (1)^2 = 2.
