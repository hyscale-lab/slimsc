Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. We have IR and 1H NMR data, and four options to choose from. Hmm, let's see.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad or maybe strong bands. I remember that N-H stretches are usually around 3300-3500. Two peaks might indicate two different N-H groups, like in an amide where there are two sets of N-H (primary amide maybe?), or perhaps an amino group. Wait, but looking at the options, some have amide groups, some have amino.

The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. That could be an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But looking at the options, all of them have either an ester or amide group, I think. So, that's a good start.

Now the 1H NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe an ethyl group, like OCH2CH3 or something. The triplet shape suggests it's next to a CH2, so ethyl ester perhaps. Because in ethyl groups, the CH3 is split into a triplet by the neighboring CH2.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet could be an NH group, maybe from an amide or amine. Or possibly an OCH2 group. But the singlet suggests that the two protons are equivalent and not split much. Wait, if it's an amino group (-NH2), it would usually show as a broad peak, but two protons would be a singlet only if they're not split by neighboring groups. Maybe it's an -OCH2O- group, but that's less likely. Alternatively, if it's an NH2, the integration is 2H, which fits. But let me check the options.

- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet, 2H. That's typical of a CH2 group next to a CH3 that's a triplet. So, OCH2CH3 perhaps? Like an ethoxy group. Wait, the quartet at 4.5 ppm could be from an ethyl ester. Because in an ethyl group, the CH2 closer to the oxygen is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH3. So, ethyl ester is possible here.

- 7.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. And 8.0 ppm, another doublet (d), 2H. This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each set of
