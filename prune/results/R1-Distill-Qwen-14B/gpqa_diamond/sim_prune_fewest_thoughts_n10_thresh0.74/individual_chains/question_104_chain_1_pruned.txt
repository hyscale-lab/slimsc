Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the scenario is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets have circular orbits, so that's good because eccentricity might complicate things, but we don't have to worry about that here.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. They detected these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method. From what I remember, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the velocity of the star moving due to the planet.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * (M_planet)^3 ) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * some constants.

Wait, no, maybe I should recall the exact formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * ( (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much lighter than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit. Also, since the planets have similar masses (both ~Neptune), their masses are the same, so M_planet is same for both. And the stars are same mass, so M_star is same for both.

But in the problem, the RV shifts (5 and 7 milliangstroms) are given. But wait, what's the exact relationship between the shift and the semi-amplitude K?
