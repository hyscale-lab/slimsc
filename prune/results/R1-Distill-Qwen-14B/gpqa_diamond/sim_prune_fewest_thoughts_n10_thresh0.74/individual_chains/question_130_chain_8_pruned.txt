Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that redshift has to do with how much the wavelength of light is stretched as it travels through the expanding universe. The formula I think I need is the redshift formula, which relates the observed wavelength (lambda_observed) to the emitted wavelength (lambda_emitted). The formula is z = (lambda_observed / lambda_emitted) - 1. Right, that's how redshift is calculated.

So, Lyman alpha emission is at about 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. But when it's redshifted, the observed wavelength would be longer. Now, the question is about detecting this with optical ground-based telescopes. I think optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Wait, but wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the ultraviolet range. Oh, right, because optical light is longer than that.

But wait, if the quasar's light is being absorbed by hydrogen clouds, the absorbed wavelength would be at 1216 Angstroms, but the transmitted or emitted light from the quasar would have certain features. Wait, no. The Lyman alpha absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. So when the hydrogen cloud is moving away from us, it absorbs light at a longer wavelength than that, depending on the redshift.

The quasar emits light across the spectrum, but for us to detect the absorption line in the optical range, the redshifted wavelength of 1216 Angstroms must fall into the optical range. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). We need lambda_obs to be less than or equal to about 700 nm (since that's the red end of optical). Wait, but wait, waitâ€”no, because if the observed wavelength is in the optical, which is longer than the UV. So wait, if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), then when z is zero, it's in the UV. But if the cloud is at a higher redshift, then the observed wavelength is longer.

But for ground-based optical telescopes, they can't observe UV because the atmosphere absorbs that. So the observed Lyman alpha absorption must be in the optical range so that it can be detected. So the question is, what's the minimum redshift z such that 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z) is within the optical range.

Wait, but wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed at the Lyman alpha wavelength. So the quasar's light
