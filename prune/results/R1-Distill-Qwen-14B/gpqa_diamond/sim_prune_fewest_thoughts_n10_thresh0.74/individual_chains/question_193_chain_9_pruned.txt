Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. The options are A to D, each with some power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax in astronomy is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to parallax (in arcseconds). So, distance r is roughly equal to 1/(plx), where plx is the parallax. So, r = 1/plx. That means plx = 1/r.

Wait, but the question says N varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx from the distance formula, that becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Oh wait, but wait a second—that can't be right because as distance increases, the number of stars shouldn't just go up without end. Or maybe in this hypothetical scenario, it does?

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region should relate to the volume, right? Because more distant regions have larger volumes, so more stars. But the problem says that the number varies with parallax in a specific way, so maybe it's a different situation.

Wait, but the standard approach to how the number of stars depends on distance is considering the volume. Volume increases with r^3, so if the density is uniform, the number of stars would go up with r^3. But in this question, it's given that N varies as 1/(plx)^5, which, as I said earlier, translates to r^5. So according to the problem, N is proportional to r^5, which would mean the number of stars increases rapidly with distance, which seems counterintuitive
