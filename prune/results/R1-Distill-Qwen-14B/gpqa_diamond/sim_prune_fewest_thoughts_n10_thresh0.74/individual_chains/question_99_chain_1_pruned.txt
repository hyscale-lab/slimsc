Okay, so I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's start by looking at the FTIR and 1H NMR information.

First, the FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. That broad peak probably indicates an O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches which are usually broad. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, but more likely a carboxylic acid since the broad O-H is present.

So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group. Now, looking at the 1H NMR data: there are several signals, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds or rings with adjacent hydrogens, so the molecule is probably saturated—no alkenes or aromatic rings.

In the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets (DTq), and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets (DTt). I'm a bit rusty on splitting patterns, but I think this has to do with the neighboring protons.

Let me imagine the structure. The options are various substituted carboxylic acids. Let's look at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, so that's like a di-substituted butyl group perhaps? Let me write it as something like CH2CH2C(CH3)(C2H5)… No, wait, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central carbon (probably the carbonyl is in the COOH group at the end). Wait, the central part is two CH groups attached to two ethyl groups. So the structure is something like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, no: the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)... Wait, maybe the first part is (CH3)(CH2CH3)C- ... So each of the central carbons (the two CH groups) have two substituents: one CH3 and one C2H5? So each of those CH's is connected to two different groups. That might lead to some splitting in the NMR.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So that's more like:

CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So the central part is two CH groups attached to ethyl groups and another substituent. Wait, the first part is CH3CH2-, then the next carbons are each a CH attached to a C2H5 group. So the structure is (CH2CH3)C(H)(C2H5)-
