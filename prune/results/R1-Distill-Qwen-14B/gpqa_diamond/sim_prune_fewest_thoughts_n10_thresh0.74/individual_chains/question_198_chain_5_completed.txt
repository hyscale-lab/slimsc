Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me see what I can remember. So the question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, let me start by understanding the problem. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Oh wait, I think stability constants are the formation constants, right? So βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n thiocyanate ions.

Wait, but the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact complexes. I remember that cobalt can form different colored complexes, like pink for the hexaaquachromium and blue for some thiocyanate complexes. The blue ones are usually the higher order complexes, maybe with more SCN- ions.

So the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. The stability constants βn indicate how stable each complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

The question is asking about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which would be [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) maybe? Or is it another one. Wait, wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) or [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or maybe it's another structure. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the one with more SCN- ions, like the tetra? Wait, no, the blue is usually associated with the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, which is called the cobalt thiocyanate blue. Or maybe the hexa? Wait, no, I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the common blue complex. Hmm, but the problem says "dithiocyanato," which implies two SCN groups. Wait, did I mix something up?

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- groups attached. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) maybe. Alternatively, perhaps [Co(SCN)_3]^- or [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the β values to figure out which is the dominant complex. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, so β3 is the highest. That suggests that the complex with 3 SCN- ions is the most stable. So the most predominant species would be [Co(SCN)_3]^(−), I think. But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ions.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The formation of complexes for Co(II) with thiocyanate would proceed stepwise. The first complex is [CoSCN]^+, where β1 is the formation constant for adding the first SCN-: Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+, β1=9.

The second complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^(0), with β2=40. So the formation of this would be [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and β2 is 40. Similarly, β3=63 is for the next step, so [Co(SCN)_3]^- would form from [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_3]^- with β3=63. And β4=16 is for the next step, making [Co(SCN)_4]^2-: [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_4]^(2-), β4=16.

So the stability constants are for each step. To find the distribution of the species, I think we need to calculate the fraction of each complex in the solution. The problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

But wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." I'm a bit uncertain whether [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue. I thought the blue color comes from the tetra or another complex, but perhaps the dithiocyanate is the blue one. Maybe I should proceed with the calculations regardless of the color and see.

So, the approach here is to consider all possible complexes and calculate their concentrations relative to each other. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, so all species (free Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^(2-)) sum up to 0.01 M.

The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We can model this using the stability constants and the given concentrations.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be found using the formula that involves the log of the stability constants and concentrations. Alternatively, it's often handled using the formation of each step.

Wait, perhaps the most straightforward way is to use the concept of the distribution of species in a solution with multiple stepwise formation constants. The general approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

But considering the mathematics, let's think about the expression for each complex's concentration.

The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free Co²+ and the respective SCN^- concentrations.

Let me denote:

[Co²+] = c
[SCN^-] = s = 0.1 M

The stability constants are given for each step.

For the first complex, [CoSCN]^+:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]) → [CoSCN^+] = β1 * c * s

Second complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0:

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-]) → [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * [CoSCN^+] * s = β2 * (β1 c s) * s = β1 β2 c s²

Third complex [Co(SCN)_3^-]:

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co(SCN)_2^0][SCN^-]) → [Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2^0] * s = β3 * (β1 β2 c s²) * s = β1 β2 β3 c s³

Fourth complex [Co(SCN)_4^2-]:

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/([Co(SCN)_3^-][SCN^-]) → [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3^-] * s = β4 * (β1 β2 β3 c s^3) * s = β1 β2 β3 β4 c s^4

Wait, but that's assuming each step is multiplied by the next. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model all possible complexes and their concentrations relative to the free ion.

But wait, the problem is that the sum of all these complexes plus the free Co²+ equals the total cobalt concentration, which is 1e-2 M.

So, the total cobalt is:

c_total = c + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-]

Which is:

c_total = c + β1 c s + β1 β2 c s² + β1 β2 β3 c s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 c s^4

Wait, no. Because each complex's concentration is built upon the previous one, using the stability constants. So the approach might be to express each complex's concentration in terms of c, and then sum them up to equal the total cobalt concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the fraction of each species. The fraction f_n for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) * s^n / (1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s² + β1 β2 β3 s³ + ... )

Wait, that's the general formula for the fraction of each species in a series of complexes with stepwise formation constants. So the denominator is the sum of all possible species, each term being the product of the β's up to that point multiplied by s raised to the number of ligand ions (n).

So, for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), the fraction is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) * s^n / D,

where D = 1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s^2 + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4

Because in this case, the maximum n is 4, since β4 is given.

Wait, but wait. The first term in the denominator is 1, which corresponds to the free Co²+ ion (n=0). Then the next term is β1 s, which is the concentration of the first complex (n=1). Then the next is β1 β2 s², which is the concentration of the second complex (n=2), and so on.

So, for our case, D = 1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s² + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4.

Then, the fractions for each species are:

f0 = 1 / D → free Co²+.

f1 = β1 s / D → [CoSCN]^+.

f2 = β1 β2 s² / D → [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

f3 = β1 β2 β3 s^3 / D → [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

f4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4 / D → [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Since the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 case, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So its fraction is f2 = (β1 β2 s²) / D.

So let's compute each term.

Given:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

s=0.1 M.

So let's compute each term in D.

Compute:

Term0 = 1.

Term1 = β1 * s = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

Term2 = β1 β2 s² = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 → 9*40=360, 0.1^2=0.01 → 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3 = β1 β2 β3 s^3 = 9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 → let's compute step by step.

9*40=360, 360*63=22680. (0.1)^3=0.001 → 22680 * 0.001=22.68.

Term4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4 → 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362,880. s^4 is (0.1)^4=1e-4=0.0001. So 362,880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So, D = Term0 + Term1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4 = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me sum these:

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D = 64.468.

Then, f2 is (β1 β2 s²) / D = 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05558.

Wait, 3.6 divided by 64.468. Let me compute that.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ let's see: 3.6 /64 ≈ 0.05625. But since 64.468 is a bit larger, the value would be slightly smaller.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ approx 0.05558, or 5.558%.

Wait, but the options given are in the 16-42% range. Hmm, that's quite low. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I missed a term in the denominator. Let's recheck.

Wait, wait a second. The β4 is 16, and in the term4, we have β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4. Did I compute that correctly?

Yes, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362,880. s^4 is 0.1^4=0.0001. So 362,880 * 0.0001 = 36.288. That's correct.

Hmm. So the denominator is 64.468, and f2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 5.558%.

But the options don't have that. The options are A)42.3, B)25.6, C)38.1, D)16.9.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a term? Or maybe I misapplied the formula.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should include all possible terms, including the next higher terms beyond 4. But in this case, n=4 is the maximum because β4 is the last given constant. So the denominator is correct as is.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of D.

Let me recalculate D:

Term0: 1.

Term1: 0.9 → 1+0.9=1.9.

Term2: 3.6 → 1.9 +3.6=5.5.

Term3:22.68 → 5.5 +22.68=28.18.

Term4:36.288 → 28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, so f2 is about 5.56%, which is not among the options.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of "blue dithiocyanato complexes". Maybe the blue complex isn't [Co(SCN)_2]^0 but another one, like [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. Because I remember that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the blue one, and [Co(SCN)_2]Cl2 is pink, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe I got the complexes mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but it's not the blue one. The blue is the tetra one, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So, the question is asking for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN groups, but blue is associated with four. Maybe the question has a typo? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms.

Wait, maybe the problem says "dithiocyanato" but refers to [Co(SCN)_4]^2- as the blue complex. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the same complex as [Co(SCN)_2]Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the percentage. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions of all complexes and see which one is the blue one.

Looking at the fractions:

f0 = 1 /64.468 ≈ 0.0155 → 1.55%.

f1 = 0.9 /64.468 ≈ 0.01396 → ~1.396%.

f2 ≈5.558% → 3.6/64.468.

f3 = (β1 β2 β3 s^3) / D → 22.68 /64.468 ≈ 0.3518 → 35.18%.

f4=36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5628 →56.28%.

Wait, so the largest fraction is f4, which is about 56.28%, followed by f3 (35.18%), then f2 (5.55%), then f1, and f0.

But wait, the sum of f0 +f1 +f2 +f3 +f4 should be 100%?

1.55 +1.396≈ 2.95; +5.558≈8.5; +35.18≈43.68; +56.28≈99.96. So nearly 100%. Close enough, considering rounding.

So, the major species are the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (56%) and [Co(SCN)_3]^- (35%).

So, the blue complex is likely [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (f4=56%), and if the question is about dithiocyanato, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, that would be f2=5.55%. But none of the options match that.

Wait, but the options don't have 5.5%. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Another thought: perhaps the stability constants given are for the overall formation, not stepwise. But no, the problem says the stability constants are β1, β2, etc., which are usually stepwise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the stability constants are for the overall complex. For example, β1 would be [CoSCN^+]/(Co²+ SCN^-), β2 would be [Co(SCN)_2^0]/(Co²+ (SCN^-)^2 ), and so on. So in that case, the denominator for each term would be [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the expression for each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) = βn * [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

In that scenario, the total concentration is the sum of each species:

c_total = [Co²+] + β1 [Co²+][SCN^-] + β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co²+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co²+][SCN^-]^4.

Factor out [Co²+]:

c_total = [Co²+] (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Let me denote [Co²+] as c. So,

c_total = c (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 )

Wait, but in this case, the denominator would be 1 + β1 s + β2 s^2 + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4.

Wait, but earlier approach considered all possible stepwise formation constants, leading to the denominator as 1 + β1 s + (β1β2) s² + (β1β2β3) s^3 + ... But that's when the β's are stepwise.

But now, the approach is if βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex, then the denominator becomes 1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4.

So, this is a different scenario. Let me recalculate using this method.

So, given that, the denominator becomes:

Denominator D = 1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4.

Which is:

D = 1 + (9)(0.1) + (40)(0.1)^2 + (63)(0.1)^3 + (16)(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1 → 1.

9 *0.1 → 0.9.

40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01 =0.4.

63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001 =0.063.

16 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Summing up:

1 +0.9=1.9.

1.9 +0.4=2.3.

2.3 +0.063=2.363.

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So, Denominator D=2.3646.

Then, the fraction for each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]/c_total = (βn s^n)/D.

So, for the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2:

f2= (β2 s²) / D = (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / 2.3646.

Compute numerator:40 *0.01=0.4.

So f2=0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 →16.9%.

Which is option D.

Wait, but according to this approach, the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D. So that would match one of the options.

But wait, in this approach, I'm assuming the β's are overall constants, not stepwise. But the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Stability constants are typically overall, not stepwise. So perhaps this is the correct approach.

Wait, so which is correct? Are the β's stepwise or overall?

I think I've made a mistake earlier in assuming they are stepwise. The problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So each βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions.

So, for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), the stability constant βn is:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^n )

So, when n=1: β1=9 = [CoSCN^+]/( [Co²+][SCN^-] )

n=2: β2=40= [Co(SCN)_2^0]/( [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 )

and so on.

In that case, the total concentration is:

c_total = [Co²+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-]

Expressed in terms of [Co²+], each [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

So:

c_total = [Co²+] (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 )

Where s is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

So,

[Co²+] = c_total / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 )

But the fractions of each complex are (βn s^n ) / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 )

Because [Co(SCN)_n]/c_total = (βn s^n [Co²+]) / c_total = (βn s^n ) / (1 + β1 s + ... + β4 s^4 )

So, for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2):

f2 = (β2 s²) / D,

where D=1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4.

As calculated earlier, D=2.3646.

β2 s²=40*(0.01) =0.4.

So f2=0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169 → 16.9%.

Which matches option D.

So the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, earlier in the stepwise approach, the fraction was 5.5%, but with the overall approach, it's 16.9%. So which approach is correct?

In the first approach, I assumed the β's were stepwise, which led to a much lower f2. But in the second approach, treating βn as overall, f2 is 16.9%.

So the confusion arises from whether the β's are stepwise or overall. The question states that β1, β2, etc., are the stability constants of the complexes. So each βn is the equilibrium constant for the overall formation of the nth complex from Co²+ and n SCN^-.

Thus, the correct approach is the second one, leading to f2=16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I thought the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4). So if that's the case, the percentage for the blue would be:

f4 = (β4 s^4 ) / D = (16 * (0.1)^4 ) / 2.3646.

Compute numerator: 16 * 0.0001= 0.0016.

So f4=0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 → 0.0676%, which is almost negligible. So that can't be.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because according to the second approach, the major species are [Co(SCN)_3]^- and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, let me compute all fractions with the correct approach.

Compute each term:

β1 s =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 s²=40 *0.01=0.4.

β3 s^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 s^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So, D=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016= 2.3646.

Then,

f0 =1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423 →42.3%.

f1=0.9 /2.3646≈0.381 →38.1%.

f2=0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

f3=0.063 /2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%.

f4=0.0016 /2.3646≈0.000676 →0.0676%.

So the breakdown is:

f0 ≈42.3%

f1≈38.1%

f2≈16.9%

f3≈2.66%

f4≈0.0676%

So, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 16.9%, which is option D. But the question is about "blue dithiocyanato complexes".

Wait, but according to the fractions, the major species are f0 and f1. So the [Co²+] is 42.3%, [CoSCN^+] is 38.1%, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 16.9%, and the rest are negligible.

So, in this case, the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is 16.9%, and the blue complex is a different one, perhaps [Co(SCN)_4]^2- which is 0.0676% of the total.

But the question specifically asks for the blue dithiocyanato complexes. That term is confusing because dithiocyanato implies two SCN groups, but the blue is usually with four. So maybe the question has a typo, and it's referring to the tetra complex as the blue one. Alternatively, perhaps the blue is one of the other complexes.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the blue is the [Co(SCN)_2]Cl2, which is the dithiocyanato complex.

In that case, the percentage would be 16.9%, which is option D.

So, the correct answer is D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- **Total cobalt concentration**: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **Thiocyanate concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]

The stability constants (\( \beta_n \)) represent the equilibrium constants for the formation of the \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_n]^{2-n} \) complexes. The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the following species:
\[
\text{Co}^{2+}, \, [\text{CoSCN}^+], \, [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0, \, [\text{Co(SCN)}_3]^{-}, \, [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-}.
\]

The fraction of each species is determined using the formula:
\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_n \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}.
\]

### Denominator Calculation:
The denominator \( D \) is calculated as:
\[
D = 1 + \beta_1 s + \beta_2 s^2 + \beta_3 s^3 + \beta_4 s^4,
\]
where \( s = [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

Substituting the values:
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Term}_0 &= 1, \\
\text{Term}_1 &= \beta_1 s = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \\
\text{Term}_2 &= \beta_2 s^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\
\text{Term}_3 &= \beta_3 s^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\
\text{Term}_4 &= \beta_4 s^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
\end{align*}
\]

Summing these terms:
\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

### Fraction of the Dithiocyanato Complex:
The dithiocyanato complex corresponds to \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0 \) (n = 2). Its fraction is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 s^2}{D}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%.
\]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.

ANSWER: D
