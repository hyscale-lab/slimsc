Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and calculating its comoving distance using the Lambda-CDM model parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let me think.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Wait, why is that significant? Oh right, I think the peak in the rest-frame near-infrared might be due to something like the Lyman-alpha forest or maybe dust reddening. Wait, no, Lyman-alpha is in the UV. Alternatively, maybe it's the emission line like H-alpha. H-alpha is at about 656 nm in the rest frame. So if the observed wavelength is 790, that's longer, so redshifted. Let me calculate the redshift.

Redshift z is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 / 656 ≈ 1.204. Subtract 1, so z ≈ 0.204. Wait, but wait, the peak is in the near infrared. Oh, maybe it's another line. Alternatively, the peak could be the Balmer break or something else. Or perhaps it's the so-called Lyman limit at 912 Angstroms, but that's in the far UV. Hmm, if the observed peak is 790 nm (which is 7900 Angstroms), then that's too redshifted for the Lyman limit. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman series, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The peak is in the near infrared, so what if it's the rest-frame optical? For example, the rest wavelength of the peak is 790 nm, but that's already in the near IR. Wait, no, the peak is observed at 790, but the shorter wavelengths (optical) have lower flux. So perhaps it's a feature like the Lyman limit, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman break. The Lyman break occurs when the intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes transparent at wavelengths longer than 912 Angstroms (91.2 nm) times (1+z). So if the observed peak is 790 nm, which is 7900 Angstroms, that would be the rest wavelength of 912*(1+z) = 7900? Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, and the rest wavelength is, say, the Lyman limit at 912 Angstroms (0.0912 nm). Then, 0.0912*(1+z) = 0.790. So 1+z = 0.790 / 0.0912 ≈ 8.66. So z ≈ 7.66. But wait, that's a really high redshift, and the question gives us a Hubble constant of 70 km/s/Mpc. That would suggest a comoving distance around a few Gpc, but high redshift could mean larger distance.

Wait, but the peak is in the near infrared. Let me think of the rest-frame. If the peak is at 790 nm in our observation, but in the quasar's frame it's in the optical. So maybe the rest wavelength is in the optical, say around 500 nm. Then observed would be longer. Let me recalculate. 500 nm * (1+z) = 790 nm. So 1+z = 790/500 = 1.58 → z ≈ 0.58. Hmm, that's a more reasonable redshift.

But wait, the question states that the flux drops significantly below 790 nm. That's shorter wavelengths. So in the quasar's frame, if it's a peak at, say, 79
