Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through this.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, wait—so I think that's a two-component vector. So the state is χ = [3i, 4]^T, right? Or maybe it's written as a column vector with components 3i and 4.

The question asks for the expectation value of S_y. Oh right, the expectation value is the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured S_y many times on identically prepared systems.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, multiplied by the state vector. So the formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = χ† σ_y χ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y.

What's σ_y again? Oh yeah, the matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So that's the Pauli Y matrix.

So putting it all together, I need to compute χ† times σ_y times χ.

Let me write down χ as a column vector:
χ = [3i; 4]

The conjugate transpose χ† would be [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i?), wait no—wait, wait. Wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i? No, wait, (3i)* is -3i? Wait, no, hang on. If you have a complex number z = a + bi, its conjugate is a - bi. So 3i is 0 + 3i, so the conjugate is 0 -3i, which is -3i. So χ† is [ -3i, 4* ]? Wait, χ is [3i,4], so χ† is [ (3i)*, 4* ].

Wait, 4 is a real number, so 4* is just 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait no, wait a second. Wait, the original state is (3i,4). So the components are 3i (which is the first component) and 4 (second component). So χ is a column vector with first element 3i and second 4. So χ† will be a row vector with the conjugate of each component. So for the first component, 3i's conjugate is -3i. The second component is 4, which stays 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So now, I need to compute χ† σ_y χ.

Let me compute this step by step. First, multiply χ† with σ_y, then multiply the result by χ.

Let me write down σ_y again:

σ_y = [ [0, -i],
         [i, 0] ]

So, first, let's compute χ† σ_y. χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Multiplying χ† (which is a 1x2 matrix) with σ_y (2x2) will give a 1x2 matrix.

Let me compute each element:

First element of the product: (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 + 4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) = (3i^2) + 0. Wait, i^2 is -1, so 3i^2 is 3*(-1) = -3. So it's 3i*(-i) is (-3i^2) which is 3, right? Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, (-3i)*(-i) = (3i^2) because (-3i)(-i) = 3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3. So the second
