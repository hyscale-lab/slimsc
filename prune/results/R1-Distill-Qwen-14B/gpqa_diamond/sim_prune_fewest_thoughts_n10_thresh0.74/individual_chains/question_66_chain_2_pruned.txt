Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries are we talking about here?

The question gives four options, and I have to choose which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think through each.

First, Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is built within the Standard Model's framework, so I think all operators must respect Lorentz invariance. Because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz symmetric, and SMEFT extends it with higher-dimension terms. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely required. That means any operator in SMEFT should be Lorentz-invariant.

Then Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? So if the theory already respects Lorentz, it should automatically have Poincare symmetry too. But wait, when you add effective operators, do you have to explicitly ensure Poincare? Or does it come for free if the original theory has it?

I think that in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that maintains Poincare symmetry because the SM itself is Poincare invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare. So option 2 is also a must.

Next, CP symmetry. I'm a bit unsure here. The Standard Model isn
