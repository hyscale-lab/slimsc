Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be some sort of substituted carboxylic acids. Let's break down the data provided.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. A carboxylic acid has a broad O-H peak because the O-H group is hydrogen-bonded, which broadens the peak. So that makes sense; the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Next, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That peak is likely from the carbonyl group (C=O) in the carboxylic acid. The carbonyl stretch in carboxylic acids is usually around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits. So the compound definitely has a carboxylic acid group, which is good because all the options are carboxylic acids.

Now onto the 1H NMR data. The question states that several peaks were observed, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. Since none are present, the compound doesn't have any double bonds. So all the structures we are considering must be saturated, which they are because all the options are single bonds.

One of the signals is a doublet of triplet of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplet of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about how splitting works in NMR. Each splitting comes from coupling with neighboring hydrogen groups.

First, let's consider the structure of each option. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is like CH2CH2 groups attached to a central carbon chain, and a CH2 before the COOH. Wait, let me write it out. The main chain would be:

- The central part: maybe something like CH2-C(CH2CH3)(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH? Wait no, let me parse the formula correctly.

Wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the first CH3 is attached to a carbon that is attached to another CH (but with two CH2CH3 groups?), wait no. Wait, maybe it's a structure like:

- The central part is two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group. So something like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So the first CH3 is attached
