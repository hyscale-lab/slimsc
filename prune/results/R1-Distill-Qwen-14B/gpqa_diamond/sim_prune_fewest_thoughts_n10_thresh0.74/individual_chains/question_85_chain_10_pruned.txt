Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again carefully.

So, the setup is about two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are A to D, with numbers like 0.98, 1.30, etc.

I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The main formula I recall is the one for a planet's equilibrium temperature, which is based on the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and some factors like albedo and greenhouse effects. But since the question says both planets have the same albedo, that should cancel out in the ratio. 

The formula I think is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. But wait, because the question says same albedo, so that term would be same for both planets, so it will cancel when taking the ratio.

Wait, no. Let me get the exact formula. The equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25 

Where A is the albedo. Since both planets have same albedo, (1-A) would be the same for both, so when we take the ratio T1/T2, that term would cancel out. So the ratio depends only on the star's T, R, and the planet's semi-major axis.

Wait, but the star's T is given as 6300 K for both, same star. And R is 1.2 solar radii, so R_star is fixed also. So the only variable is the semi-major axis (a) for each planet.

Wait, but the question gives us information about the RV method and transit method. How does that help us find the semi-major axes?

Hmm. So for the RV method, the Doppler shift tells
