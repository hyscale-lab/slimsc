Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me break this down.

First, I need to draw the structure to visualize it better. The benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy, nitro, and tert-butyl. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. Wait, wait, no, the substituents' positions are according to the numbering given in the name. Let me think again: the main substituents are in which positions?

The name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has three substituents. The numbering starts from the ethoxy group as position 1. Then moving clockwise, the nitro is position 3, and tert-butyl is position 2. Wait, that can't be right because 1, 2, 3 should be adjacent. Let me imagine looking at the benzene ring. If position 1 is ethoxy, then position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement but in a meta arrangement perhaps? Wait, actually, if positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, then it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

But wait, the substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1, nitro (NO2) at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. That means the three substituents are adjacent to each other in a way that each is next to the others. Hmm, that's a meta arrangement? No, meta is 1,3, but with three substituents, perhaps it's a 1,2,3 arrangement.

But how does that relate to the synthesis steps? The synthesis steps are about electrophilic substitution reactions. The order of adding substituents matters because each new group directs the next substitution.

Let me outline the target structure:

Positions:
- 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH3)
- 2: tert-butyl (C(CH2CH3)3 or C(CH3)3)
- 3: nitro (NO2)

Wait, no, the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent in a row.

But that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a meta arrangement relative to each other, but I think I should focus on the synthesis steps.

The starting material is benzene. So the first step is probably introducing one substituent. Let's think about which substituent would be best to introduce first.

The substituents are ethoxy, nitro, and tert-butyl. Each of these can be introduced via electroph
