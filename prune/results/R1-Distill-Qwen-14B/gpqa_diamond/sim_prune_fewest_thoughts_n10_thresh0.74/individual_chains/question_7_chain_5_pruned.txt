Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question says that high-energy gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The process is gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. I need to find the energy at which the lifetime of these gamma-rays is limited by this process.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of a particle is related to its mean free path. The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before interacting. If the mean free path is small compared to the size of the universe, then the particle's lifetime is effectively limited because it interacts quickly, meaning it doesn't last long enough to travel far.

So the key here is to find the energy where the interaction rate (gamma-ray with CMB photons) becomes significant enough that the gamma-rays can't travel far, thus their lifetime is limited.

I think the formula for the cross-section for this process is involved. The cross-section σ is the probability that two particles will interact. For pair production via CMB photons, I recall that the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by the so-called Klein-Nishina formula, but at high energies, it might be approximated by the Thomson cross-section multiplied by some factor, maybe the logarithm of the energy ratio.

Wait, more accurately, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * (ln(Eγ / m_e c²)) / (Eγ^2)

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, at high energies, the cross-section might scale as σ ~ (α^2 / Eγ^2) * ln(Eγ), where α is the fine-structure constant (~1/137), m_e is the electron mass, and Eγ is the gamma-ray energy.

The mean free path λ is the inverse of the interaction rate per unit length. The interaction rate Γ is given by the product of the cross-section σ and the photon density n_photon.

So, Γ = σ * n_photon * v,

where v is the velocity of the gamma-ray. But since gamma-rays are massless, v is approximately c.

The photon density n_photon for the CMB is about 400 photons per cubic meter, but wait, that's the standard number. Let me think. The CMB photon density can be calculated using the formula for a blackbody.

The energy density u of a blackbody is u = 8π (k_B T)^4 / (15 h^4 c^3), where T is the temperature. For T = 2.7 K, I can compute u, but maybe it's easier to know that the average number density is n ≈ (2.725 * 10^8) photons per cubic meter, but that's for T=1 K. Wait, no, actually, the standard number is about 411 photons per cubic centimeter, which is 411e6 per cubic meter. So n_photon ≈ 411 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3.

But wait, the problem statement says that the average photon energy is
