Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a given potential. Hmm, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Interesting, so it depends on both r and θ.

Wait, I remember that in two-dimensional problems, sometimes it's helpful to go into polar coordinates and use separation of variables. Oh right, because the potential here seems to be a function of r and θ, which suggests that the problem might be separable into radial and angular parts.

Let me think. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out the r²: so V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, that might help in separating variables.

So the total Hamiltonian for the particle would be H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ), right? Because the Hamiltonian is the kinetic plus potential energy. And p² in polar coordinates is a bit tricky, but I think it's p_r² + p_θ², but I have to remember the correct expression.

Wait, the momentum operator in polar coordinates. The kinetic energy in 2D polar coordinates is (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) ) + (1/(r²)) (d²/dθ²) ) ] . So the Hamiltonian would be H = (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) d/dr (r d/dr) + (1/r²) d²/dθ² ] + (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ).

Hmm, but wait, the potential is (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So when I factor that, it's (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ). So the potential has terms involving cos²θ. That suggests that the potential varies with θ, so it's not spherically symmetric. Oh, in that case, the problem might have angular dependence in the potential, which complicates things
