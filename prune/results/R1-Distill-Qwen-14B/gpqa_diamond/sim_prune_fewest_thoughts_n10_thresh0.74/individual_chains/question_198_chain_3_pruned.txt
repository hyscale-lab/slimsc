Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta (β) value, the more stable the complex.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused about the order. Oh right, βn is for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ligands, so that's the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex. So we need the fraction of Co that's in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

I think the approach is to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations, then find the fraction that corresponds to the dithiocyanato species.

The formation of complexes occurs stepwise. The first step is Co²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]+ with β1 =9. The second step is [Co(SCN)]+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]³+ with β2=40, but wait, no, wait wait. Wait, the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^(?), [Co(SCN)₃]^?, etc. Wait, I might have the charges wrong. Let me think. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So:

Co²+ is +2.

[Co(SCN)]^+ would be +1 charge because 2 + (-1) = +1.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 would be 2*(-1) +2 = 0.

[Co(SCN)₃]^- would be 3*(-1) +2 = -1.

[Co(SCN)₄]^2- would be 4*(-1) +2 = -2.

Wait, but the beta values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β
