Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, okay. So I remember that in two dimensions, polar coordinates are often used, which makes sense here.

Wait, energy levels in quantum mechanics usually come from solving the Schrödinger equation. So the potential here looks like it's a combination of terms. Let me think: the first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential because the standard form is (1/2)m ω² r², but here it's (1/2)k r². So maybe k is m ω² or something. Not sure yet, but I'll note that.

The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Cos squared theta makes me think of angular dependence. Oh, wait, but in polar coordinates, sometimes it's easier to separate the equation into radial and angular parts. So maybe this potential can be rewritten in a way that allows separation.

Let me try to rewrite V(r,θ). So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, can I factor this differently? Let's factor out (1/2)k r²: 

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ].

Wait, because 3/2 is 3*(1/2), so it's (1 + 3 cos²θ) multiplied by (1/2)k r². Hmm, that might be helpful, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, I remember that cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let me substitute that in:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos 2θ)/2.

Simplify that: The second term becomes (3/4)k r² (1 + cos 2θ). So adding to the first term:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² [1 + cos 2θ].

Wait, let's compute that: 1/2 + 3/4 is 5/4. So the potential becomes (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ.

Hmm, okay. But how does this help? I'm trying to think if this can be written as a sum of harmonic oscillator potentials in different directions. Because in 2D, sometimes you can separate the problem into radial and angular parts, but maybe here it's more about expressing the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, because in polar coordinates, r² cos 2θ is equivalent to (x² - y²). Because x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So (x² - y²) = r² (cos²θ - sin²θ) = r² cos 2θ. Oh right! So the term (3/4)k r² cos 2θ becomes (3/4)k (x² - y²).

So putting it all together, the potential V(r,θ) can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates. Let me do that.

V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k (x² - y²).

Wait, but r² is x² + y². So substituting that in:

V(x,y) = (5/4)k (x² + y²) + (3/4)k (x² - y^2).

Let me distribute the terms:

= (5/4 k x² + 5/4 k y²) + (3/4
