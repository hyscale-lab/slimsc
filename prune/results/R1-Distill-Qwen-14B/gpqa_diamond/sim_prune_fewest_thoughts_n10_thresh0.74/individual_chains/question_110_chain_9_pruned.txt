Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including measuring stellar velocities and studying exoplanets. But the key point here is the brightness of the stars they can observe because each spectrograph has different magnitude limits.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 is observable. And HIRES can observe brighter than 16 mag. So, apparent V mag needs to be less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. So, any star that's brighter than 17 mag (i.e., appears brighter, so lower magnitude number) can be seen by both. Because if a star is brighter than 17, it's also brighter than 16, so both can see it. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag? Or is it the other way around? Let me check: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed."

Wait, magnitude system is a bit counterintuitive. Brighter stars have
