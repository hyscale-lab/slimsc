Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Let me see what I remember about this topic. Hmm, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰.

The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are various resolutions, measured in meters.

Wait, I think this has to do with the proper lifetime and how it relates to the observed lifetime due to time dilation. The resolution probably refers to the minimum time measurement needed to capture enough decays. Because if the particles are moving fast, their lifetime as observed is longer, so the detector must have a good enough time resolution to see the decay products.

But wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution in space, not time. Or maybe it's about the minimum distance the decay products need to travel so that they can be detected. Oh, right, the Bubble Chamber detects particles by their tracks, so the particles need to travel a certain distance for the decay to be observed.

So I remember that the number of decays observed depends on the ratio of the proper lifetime to the observed lifetime, which is determined by the speed of the particle. The formula for the observed lifetime is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

The Lorentz factor γ is given by E/(m c²). Because E is given as the energy of the particle, which is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So γ would be 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91.

So, the observed lifetime τ is γ τ₀. Let me calculate that: τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. So 7.91 * 8 is 63.28, so τ is approx 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but the lifetime determines the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying. The distance L is v * τ. The speed v is approximately c for high-energy particles. So L ≈ c * τ.

The speed of light c is about
