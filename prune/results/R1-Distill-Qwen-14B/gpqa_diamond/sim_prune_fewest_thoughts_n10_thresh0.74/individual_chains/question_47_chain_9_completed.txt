Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, the task is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are four different organic compounds. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

First, let me look at the IR data. The IR shows medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are usually indicative of N-H stretching, like in amines or amides. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or amide. Since amides have N-H and carbonyl, that might fit. Alternatively, esters also have carbonyls.

Next, the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), which is probably a methyl group connected to an oxygen, like in an ethyl group (OCH2CH3 maybe). The 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad signals can be from NH groups or maybe from some coupling in an aromatic region, but since it's 2H, maybe it's something else. Then, 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q, 2H), which probably corresponds to the ethyl group next to an oxygen. So, maybe an ethyl ester or something similar.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because two doublets each integrating to 2H, which might indicate two substituents in the para positions, or maybe a meta substitution but that's less likely because the splitting would be more complex. Wait, for a para-substituted benzene, you usually have two doublets each integrating to 1H each. Wait, but here it's 2H each. Hmm. Maybe it's a substituent that's de-shielded, like a nitro group, but that's not present in the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ortho or meta arrangement, but the options given might help.

Wait, let me think again. The aromatic protons in the NMR: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). So it's two sets of two protons each. That suggests perhaps a meta substitution, but more likely, a para substitution with two substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, but each substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, causing the adjacent protons to shift. Wait, or perhaps it's an amino group which is de-shielding the adjacent protons. Hmm.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. So benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Structure would be O=C(NH2)-Ph-OCH2CH3 at position 3. But wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Ethoxy adds an O and two CH2 groups. Wait, 3-ethoxybenzamide would be C9H11NO2? Let me check. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2, which is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) adds 2 carbons, so that would make C9H11NO2. Yes, that matches.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH- something. So the structure would be O=C(N-(4-ethoxyphenyl))NH2? Wait, but formamide is HCONH2. If it's N-substituted, then the formula would be HCONHR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So, R is C6H4OCH2CH3, which is C8H7O. So the whole molecule would be HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. Wait, HCONH-R would be C1 (from HCO) + C8 (from R) = C9. So the formula would be C9H? Let's see: HCONH-R is HCONHR. H is 1, R is C8H7O. So HCONHR would have O from formamide, O from ethoxy. Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula can be calculated.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So, the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-? Wait, no, wait. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, it's CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-CH3? Wait, no, 4-aminophenyl would be C6H5NH2. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO- attached to the amine. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4- something? No, maybe it's CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene ring with NH2 at para position. So the formula would be C9H11NO2 as well. Because benzene (C6), plus propionate (C3H5O2), plus NH2 would give C9H11NO2. Yes, that's possible.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So, OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. The formula would be C9H11NO2: benzoate (C7H5O2) plus ethyl (C2H5) makes C9H10O2? Wait, wait: 4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2. The ethyl ester would replace the -OH with OEt (C2H5O), so the formula would be C7H7NO2 (from acid) plus C2H5O. Wait, but the acid is C7H7NO2, ester would be C7H6O2 (since replacing -OH with OEt (which is C2H5O)). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me calculate: benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's the ethyl ester, it's C7H5O2 plus C2H5O. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the acid is C7H6O2, the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O? Alternatively, maybe it's (C6H5COO)Et, which is C9H10O2. But wait, the formula given is C9H11NO2. So the ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2? Let me check: 4-aminobenzoate is C7H7NO2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, adding NH2 would make C7H7NO2). The ethyl ester would replace the -OH with OCH2CH3. So the formula would be C7H7NO2 (ester) → C7 + C2 = C9, H: 7 (from benzoate) + 5 (from OCH2CH3) → 12, but wait, the benzoate is RCOOEt, which is RCOOCH2CH3. So R is C6H4NH2. So RCOOCH2CH3 would be C6H4NH2COOCH2CH3. That's C9 (6 from benzene, 1 from CO, 2 from ethyl). So molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, because each group: benzene (6C), COO (2O), ethyl (2C), and NH2 (1N). So molecular formula C9H11NO2.

Now, looking back at the NMR data. Let's go step by step.

In the 1H NMR, 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → this is the CH3 of an ethyl group. So probably OCH2CH3 somewhere.

At 4.0 ppm, a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad suggests perhaps an NH group. But 2H? So maybe a NH2 that is split into a singlet, but how? Alternatively, maybe a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom, like oxygen, but as a broad peak.

At 4.5 ppm, a quartet (q, 2H). Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So if it's a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl ester: OCH2CH3. The CH2 closer to the oxygen would be a quartet because it's next to the CH3, which is a triplet. Wait, but in an ethyl group, the CH2 connected to the O would be a quartet (split by the adjacent CH3). So 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) is probably the OCH2 in an ethyl group. So, that's matching with the 1.20 t for the CH3.

So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) might be the NH2 group. Wait, but for an amine, the NH2 is usually a broad signal, but how would that account for being 2H? Wait, maybe it's an NH adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the NH2 would be a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's 2H as a broad singlet. Wait, but in reality, NH2 protons are usually broad, and for a secondary amine, perhaps a triplet or something else. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be part of a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. But if the 4.5 ppm is OCH2CH3, then where's the 4.0 ppm?

Looking at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the benzoate part would have the ester OCH2CH3 at 4.5 ppm (the OCH2). The NH2 is adjacent to the ring, so maybe its protons are in the aromatic region? No, aromatic protons are at 7 and 8 ppm. So the NH2 protons would appear elsewhere, but in this case, the NMR doesn't show any peaks in the 1-5 ppm region except 4.0.

Wait, in D's structure, the NH2 is at para position, so the protons are on the amine. They might give a broad signal. But where? They are usually in the range of 1-5 ppm, but in the NMR data, the only peaks in that range are 4.0 and 4.5, and 1.20. So the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) could be the NH2 group. But wait, an NH2 would typically show up as a broad peak, but as a singlet. So 2H in a singlet, broad. So maybe that's the case.

But wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H. If it's an NH2 group, each H would be a singlet, but since there are two Hs, it's a singlet. So the 4H is a singlet for 2H, which would make sense for an NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to oxygen. For example, if the structure is OCH2COOEt, then the CH2 might be around 4 ppm.

Wait, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. The NH would be adjacent to the carbonyl, so its protons would be deshielded, but how many H? The formamide group is HCONH2. If it's substituted, it becomes HCONHR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So it's HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. The NH would have two Hs. So the NH protons would show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H. So could that be the NH group? But NH2 would be a singlet, but perhaps as a broad peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the formamide's NH is split into a singlet, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: look at the integration. The 1.20 is 3H, which is the ethyl's CH3. 4.0 is 2H, 4.5 is 2H, and then the aromatic part is 4H (2 each at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm). So the molecule has 3+2+2+4=11 H? Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So 11 H in total. Let's check each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the ethyl group is OCH2CH3 (3 H from CH3, 2 H from OCH2). The NH2 has 2 H. The aromatic protons are 4 H in total (2 each in two doublets). So 3 (CH3) + 2 (OCH2) + 2 (NH2) + 4 (aromatic) = 11 H. Yep, matches.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. The formamide's formyl is HCO- connected to NH. So perhaps the NH has 2 H. The ethoxy has 3 H. The aromatic protons are 4 H. So 3 (CH3 ethoxy) + 2 (NH) + 4 (arom) = 9 H. But the formula requires 11 H. So that's not matching. Wait, unless I'm missing something. Wait, the formamide would be HCONH-R. R is 4-ethoxyphenyl (C6H4-OCH2CH3). So the structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the H's would be: ethoxy CH3 (3H), ethoxy OCH2 (2H), formamide's NH (2H), aromatic (4H). Total 3+2+2+4=11 H. Oh, that matches. So option B's formula is correct.

Wait, but formamide is HCONH2. When N-substituted, it becomes HCONHR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formula would be C (HCONR: R is C8H7O (since 4-ethoxyphenyl is C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H7O). Wait, HCONR is HCO-(NH-R). So H is 1, C is 1 (formyl) + R's C (8) → 9 C. H: HCONR is HCO (1 H) + NH-R (R is 8 H? Let me think: 4-ethoxyphenyl is C6H5-OCH2CH3. C6H5 has 5 H (since one H replaced by OCH2CH3). OCH2CH3 has 3 H. So R is C8H7O. So HCONR would be HCO-NH-C8H7O. So H count: 1 (HCO) + 2 (NH) +7 (from R) → 10 H. Plus ethoxy's 3 H (but wait, R includes the ethoxy). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O), so molecular formula would be C9H12NO3? Wait, wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2 → C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would add 2 C, 5 H (wait, OCH2CH3 has 3 H in CH3 and 2 H in CH2). So when we add OCH2CH3 to benzamide at position 3, the formula becomes C7 + 2 = C9, H: 7 (from benzamide) + 5 (from OCH2CH3) = 12 H, but wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2. Add OCH2CH3: so C7 + C2 = C9, H: 7 (C7H7) + 5 (C2H5) = 12 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So this would make it C9H12O3? Because benzamide is NO2, adding O (from ethoxy) makes O3. But the question's formula is NO2, so option A would have O3. But the compound is given as C9H11NO2, so option A doesn't match. So option A is out.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Let's compute the formula. Formamide is HCONH2. Replacing one H on NH2 with 4-ethoxyphenyl group (C8H7O). So the molecule becomes HCONHC6H4OCH2CH3. So the formula is C (1 from HCO) + C8 (from phenyl and ethoxy) = C9. H: HCO has 1 H, NH has 1 H (since the other is connected to R), R has (6H from benzene? Wait, no. 4-ethoxyphenyl is C6H5-OCH2CH3, which has 5 H on the benzene and 3 H on the ethoxy. So R has 8 H (5 + 3). So HCO (1H) + NH (1H) + R (8H) → 10 H. But wait, the ethoxy contributes 3 H, the benzene contributes 5 H, and the formamide contributes 1 H (from HCO) and another H from NH. So total H is 1 +1 +5 +3 = 10? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So 10 H doesn't match. So option B's formula is C9H10NO2? Because HCONR is HCONR. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as:

HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3.

HCONH: that's 1 (HCO) + 2 (NH) → 2 H? No, each group has their own H. Let's count:

- HCO: 1 H
- NH: 1 H (since it's attached to R)
- R: C6H4-OCH2CH3 → C6H4 has 4 H, OCH2CH3 has 3 H → 4 +3 =7 H.

So total H: 1 (HCO) + 1 (NH) +7 (R) = 9 H. Plus the H from HCO? No, wait, HCO has one H. So 1 +1 +7 =9. But the given compound has 11 H. So option B doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, formamide is HCONH2. When it's N-substituted, like HCONHR, R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So HCONHR → HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3.

Each H in HCONH comes from the HCO and the NH. But in the substituted form, the NH has only one H because the other is connected to R. So the H's in the molecule are:

- HCO: 1 H
- NH: 1 H
- R: C6H4-OCH2CH3 → C6H4 has 4 H (since one is replaced by OCH2CH3), OCH2CH3 has 3 H. So R contributes 4 +3 =7 H.

Total H: 1 +1 +7 =9. Plus any H from the substituents? No, because R is already accounted for. So total H is 9, but the given is 11. So option B is out.

Wait, maybe I messed up the structure. Let me think about option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the formula would be:

Benzoate: C7H5NO2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, replacing one H with NH2 makes it C7H7NO2). Then the ethyl ester replaces the -OH with OEt, which adds C2H5O. So the formula would be:

C7 (from benzoate) + C2 (from ethyl) → C9.

H: benzoate is C7H7NO2 → 7 H. Ethyl adds 5 H (since OEt is -OCH2CH3, which has 3 H in CH3 and 2 in CH2). Wait, but in the ester, OEt is -OCH2CH3. The benzoate is O-C6H4-O-CO-OEt? No, wait, the structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the ester is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the H count is:

OEt: 3 H (CH3) + 2 H (CH2) =5 H.

C6H4-NH2: the benzene has 4 H (para substitution, so two substituents, each taking one H place), and NH2 has 2 H.

So total H: 5 (OEt) +4 (C6H4) +2 (NH2) =11 H. Which matches the formula C9H11NO2.

So option D's H count is correct.

Now, looking back at the NMR data.

In option D, the structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2.

The NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → this is the CH3 of OEt.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → could be the NH2 protons. But NH2 is usually broad, and in the range of 1-5 ppm. So 2H as a broad singlet. That would fit.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → the OCH2 in the ethyl group. The quartet suggests coupling with the adjacent CH3, which is correct. So 4.5 ppm for OCH2CH3.

Then the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). For a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, like OEt and NH2 in para positions. Wait, but in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents are OEt and NH2 on the benzene ring in para positions. So the ring would have two substituents, each para.

Wait, no. The structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. Wait, no, benzoate ester is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the benzene ring has two substituents: one OEt and one NH2, para to each other. So the ring would have two substituents, each in para positions. Wait, but that would mean the ring has substituents in the 1 and 4 positions. So the aromatic protons would be at the 2,3,5,6 positions. But in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each in the 1 and 4 positions, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (ortho to substituents), and protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent (meta to substituents). Wait, no, perhaps the substituents are at 4 and something else. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the benzene ring has OEt and NH2 groups at the para positions (1 and 4). So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

So the protons on the ring would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to the OEt and para to NH2. Protons at 3 and 5 are meta to OEt and ortho to NH2.

But in such a case, would the protons at 2 and 6 be equivalent? Yes, because of the ring's symmetry. Similarly, protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent.

The chemical shifts would depend on the substituents. The OEt group is an electron-donating group (via O), which would deshield the ortho and para protons, causing their shifts. The NH2 group is a strong electron-withdrawing group (due to resonance), which would also deshield the adjacent protons.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are in para positions. So the OEt is at position 1, and NH2 at position 4. So the protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to OEt and meta to NH2. The protons at 3 and 5 are meta to OEt and ortho to NH2.

The OEt group (electron-donating) would cause the ortho protons (2 and 6) to be deshielded, appearing downfield. The NH2 (electron-withdrawing) would deshield the ortho protons (3 and 5), which are ortho to NH2.

So the two doublets in the NMR: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Let's think: the protons ortho to OEt (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded than those ortho to NH2. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, OEt is an electron-donating group, which would cause the adjacent protons (ortho) to be more deshielded, so they appear downfield. NH2 is a strong electron-withdrawing group (due to resonance), which would also deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield as well.

Wait, but in this case, the protons ortho to OEt (positions 2 and 6) are near an electron-donating group (OEt), which would make them less deshielded (wait, no, more deshielded). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Electron-donating groups like OEt increase the electron density around the ring, which would cause the adjacent (ortho and para) protons to be more shielded, appearing upfield. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing this up. Electron-donating groups activate the ring, making the ring more electron-rich. This would cause the ortho and para protons to be more deshielded because the electrons are more available to stabilize the ring, making the protons less likely to be shielded. Hmm, not sure. Let me think: when a substituent is electron-donating, it donates electrons through resonance or inductive effect. For example, -OCH3 is an activating group. When attached to benzene, it donates electrons, making the ring more reactive. The ortho and para protons are next to the substituent. The substituent's electron-donating nature would lead to increased electron density around the ring, which might cause the protons to be less shielded, hence appear downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compare with known shifts. For example, in nitrobenzene, the protons ortho to the nitro group (a strong deactivating, meta-directing group) are at higher ppm (around 8.2 ppm). In methoxybenzene, the ortho protons are around 6.8 ppm. 

In our case, the substituents are OEt and NH2. OEt is an activating group (electron-donating), while NH2 is a strong activating group (but as a substituent, it's more like a strong electron-donating group through resonance, but wait, amines are actually deactivating because of the lone pairs on N delocalizing into the ring, making the ring less electron-rich? No, wait. NH2 is a strong activating group because it's a strong electron-donating group through resonance. Wait, no, actually, the amine group is a strong activating group, ortho/para-directing. So in this structure, the presence of OEt and NH2 as substituents would affect the chemical shifts of the ring protons.

In this case, the substituents are in para positions. So the ring protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to OEt and meta to NH2. The protons at 3 and 5 are ortho to NH2 and meta to OEt.

The OEt group is electron-donating, which would cause the protons adjacent to it (2 and 6) to be more deshielded, appearing downfield. The NH2 group is also electron-donating, causing the adjacent protons (3 and 5) to be more deshielded, but perhaps more so because NH2 is a stronger activating group than OEt. Or maybe it's the opposite. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the shifts. In the NMR, the two doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Higher ppm (more downfield) suggests more deshielded. So the protons ortho to the NH2 group (positions 3 and 5) would be more downfield (higher ppm) than those ortho to OEt (positions 2 and 6).

So in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons ortho to OEt (positions 2 and 6), and the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons ortho to NH2 (positions 3 and 5). That makes sense.

So putting it all together:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): CH3 of ethyl ester.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2 group protons.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 of ethyl ester.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): protons ortho to OEt.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): protons ortho to NH2.

Now, looking at the options, option D's structure would produce this NMR. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but looking back at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. The aromatic protons would be ortho and para to the substituents. Let's consider the substituents: formamide group (HCONH) and OCH2CH3 at para positions. The aromatic protons would then be in positions 2,3,5,6. The protons in positions 2 and 6 are ortho to the formamide group and meta to OEt, while positions 3 and 5 are meta to formamide and ortho to OEt. The formamide group is an electron-withdrawing group, so the ortho protons (2 and 6) would be deshielded, appearing downfield. The OEt is electron-donating, so the ortho protons (3 and 5) would be deshielded as well but perhaps not as much as those near the formamide. So the NMR would show two doublets, one downfield and one less so. But in the given data, the aromatic protons are 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Would that match?

Alternatively, in option B, the substituents are HCONH and OCH2CH3. So the formamide is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which would cause the adjacent protons (2 and 6) to be more deshielded, hence higher ppm. The OCH2CH3 is electron-donating, so the adjacent protons (3 and 5) would be more shielded, appearing upfield. So the doublets would be at higher ppm for the protons near formamide, and lower ppm for those near OEt. So perhaps in the NMR, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the H near formamide, and 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) near OEt. That would fit.

But in option B's case, the NH would be a singlet. Wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If the structure is HCONH-R, the NH would have 2H. So the 4.0 ppm could be the NH protons, appearing as a broad singlet because of hydrogen bonding or rapid exchange. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet with 2H. That would fit.

So for option B, the aromatic protons would be at 7.0 and 8.0, as in the data. The ethyl group's CH3 would be at 1.20 (t), and the OCH2 would be at 4.5 (q). The NH group would be at 4.0 (bs, 2H). That could fit as well.

But earlier, when I checked the molecular formula, option B's formula didn't add up. Wait, let's recheck that. 

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Molecular formula: HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. Breaking down:

HCO → 1 C, 1 O, 1 H.

NH → 1 N.

C6H4 → 6 C, 4 H.

OCH2CH3 → 2 C, 3 H, 1 O.

So total C: 1 (HCO) + 6 (C6H4) + 2 (OCH2CH3) = 9 C. Correct.

H: HCO has 1 H. NH has 1 H (since it's attached to R). C6H4 has 4 H. OCH2CH3 has 3 H. So total H: 1 +1 +4 +3 =9 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So 9 H doesn't match. So option B's formula is C9H9NO3? Because HCONH-R would have O from HCO and O from ethoxy. So O count: HCO has 1 O, ethoxy has 1 O → total 2 O. Plus the O from the amide? Wait, HCONH-R is an amide, which has another O in the carbonyl. So, O count is 3. So the formula would be C9H9NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option B doesn't fit the formula. So option B is out.

So the correct answer must be option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which fits all the data.


To identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given data, we analyze the IR, 1H NMR, and the molecular formula for each option.

### IR Analysis:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Medium to strong bands, indicative of N-H stretching, likely from an amine or amide group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong band, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from an ester or amide.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, consistent with the methyl group (CH3) of an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, likely from an NH2 group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, corresponding to the methylene group (CH2) of an ethyl group adjacent to oxygen.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, indicative of a para-substituted aromatic ring.
