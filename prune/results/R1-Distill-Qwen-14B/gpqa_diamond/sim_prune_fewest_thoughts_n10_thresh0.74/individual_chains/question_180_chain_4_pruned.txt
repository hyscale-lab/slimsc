Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Hmm, let's read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Wait, so the setup is like this: There's a central point P with a fixed charge, and 12 other charges each at a distance of 2 meters from P. Since all charges are identical, I'm thinking about electrostatic interactions between them.

First, I need to figure out the potential energy of the system. Because the system is isolated, we're only considering electrostatic potential energy here, right? Since the particles are stationary, kinetic energy isn't a factor.

I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, when considering a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Oh right, because each charge interacts with every other charge.

So the system has 13 charges. Let's break it down into parts. There are two groups here: the fixed charge at P (let's call this charge Q) and the 12 charges at 2 meters away (each charge q).

So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from Q. So each of those 12 contributes a potential energy term with Q. Additionally, the 12 charges are each 2 meters from P, but what about their distances from each other? Since all 12 are at the same point (well, same distance from P), but I'm assuming they are arranged symmetrically, perhaps on a sphere around P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but how far apart are they from each other?

Wait, the problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P
