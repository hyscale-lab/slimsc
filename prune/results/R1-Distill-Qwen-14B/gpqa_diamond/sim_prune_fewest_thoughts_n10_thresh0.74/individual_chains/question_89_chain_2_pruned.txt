Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a very rigid structure, kind of like a diamond lattice but in a molecule. It's a polycyclic structure, so I think it's something like four cyclohexane rings fused together in a chair-like conformation. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions of this structure.

Then, the first reaction is heating this with excess KOH at 240°C, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think indicates a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester.

So, what happens when dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH? I remember that when vicinal dihalides (where the halogens are on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Hmm, so maybe this is a dehydrohalogenation, but not elimination across two adjacent carbons. Or perhaps it's a different mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH acts as a base, causing the two bromides to leave, but wait, that would require a strong base and maybe a good leaving group. But in this case, the product formed has a carbonyl group. Oh wait, another possibility is that KOH could cause elimination, but since the starting material isn't a vicinal dihalide, perhaps it's a different process. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, I think I remember something called the Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Alternatively, when two bromides are present on the same molecule, maybe a double elimination occurs, but that usually forms an alkyne if two H
