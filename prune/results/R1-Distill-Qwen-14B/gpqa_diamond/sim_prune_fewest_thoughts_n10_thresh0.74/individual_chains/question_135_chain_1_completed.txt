Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given its mass and the interaction Lagrangian. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, right, the interaction term probably involves the fermion fields coupling to the boson X. So, the boson X is interacting with these fermions, which suggests that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find which fermions X can decay into, considering the mass. Oh right, because for a decay X → f f̄, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f. So, the allowed fermions are those with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, since 6 GeV /2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, wait, but which fermions have masses around that range? Let me list the known fermion masses. I remember the masses of the quarks and leptons.

Leptons: electrons (0.511 MeV), muons (105.7 MeV), taus (1777 MeV, about 1.777 GeV). Oh wait, but wait, the tau is about 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So tau pairs are possible.

For quarks: up and down are light, around a few MeV each. Strangeness is about 100 MeV. Oh, but wait, the charm quark is around 1.2-1.5 GeV, and bottom is around 4.5-5 GeV. Oh wait, X has a mass of 6 GeV. So X's mass is 6 GeV. So for a decay into a quark-antiquark pair, each quark must be less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, so let's list the quarks. Up, down: very light, so 2m < 3 GeV. So u and d are definitely allowed. Strange is about 100 MeV, so also allowed. Charm is about 1.5 GeV, so 2m_c=3 GeV, so X can decay into c c̄, because 1.5 *2=3 GeV, which is equal to 3 GeV. But wait, X's mass is 6 GeV, so X's mass is twice m_c, so it's allowed. So c is okay.

Wait, but bottom is about 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b would be about 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b̄. Similarly, top quark is way heavier, so no.

So allowed fermions for decay are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but what about the interaction term in the Lagrangian? The interaction term is -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I should think about the structure here. The interaction term seems to be something like Yukawa coupling, where X is a boson coupling to a fermion ψ_f. So f is the flavor index? Or perhaps it's a typo, and perhaps it's something like ψ_f and ψ_f? Maybe the correct form is something like X ψ_f ψ_f, so that X couples to fermion pairs of the same flavor.

Wait, let me re-express the Lagrangian. It's written as:

L(y) = -λ f f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, I think perhaps f and f are the same fermion? Or maybe it's a typo and should be ψ instead. Alternatively, perhaps the term is ψ_f^dagger (ῡ + X) ψ_f, which would make sense as a Yukawa coupling. But I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps it's a Yukawa interaction where X couples to a fermion ψ_f.

Assuming that X couples to each fermion ψ_f, the decay X→ f f̄ would be possible if the mass allows.

So, for each fermion f, the decay X→ f f̄ is allowed if m_X ≥ 2 m_f.

So let's list the fermions and their masses:

Electron: ~0.511 MeV → way below 3 GeV → allowed.

Muon: ~105.7 MeV → allowed.

Tau: ~1.777 GeV → allowed (since 2*1.777=3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV? Wait, no, wait. Wait, m_X is 6 GeV. So 2*m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So for tau, 2*1.777 is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, X is 6 GeV. So 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So for tau, 1.777 GeV is below 3 GeV, so allowed.

Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV → 1.5 ≤3 → allowed.

Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → not allowed.

Top quark: way heavier, so no.

So the allowed fermions are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the decay channels would be X → e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e−. But wait, b is 4.5 GeV, 2*m_b is 9, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b̄. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. Wait, option B says c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed fermions except for the tau. Wait, but wait, tau is allowed because 1.777 GeV is less than 3 GeV. So option B includes tau. Let me check what the decay modes are.

Wait, option B says c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all the allowed. So that would be allowed. But let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all except for the charm quark? Wait, no, the option B includes c. So that's correct.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t (no, t is too heavy), tau, mu, e. Also includes t which is not allowed. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which isn't allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but looking again, option B is 'c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e'. So all the allowed fermions except for the tau? No, wait, tau is included. Yes, so B is correct.

Wait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me recount:

For X → f f̄, m_X ≥ 2 m_f.

Check each fermion:

e: yes.

mu: yes.

tau: 2 * 1.777 = ~3.554 GeV <6 GeV → yes.

u: 2 * ~2 MeV <<6 → yes.

d: same.

s: 2 * ~100 MeV → yes.

c: 2 *1.5 GeV = 3 GeV <=6 GeV → yes.

b: 2 *4.5=9>6 → no.

t: even heavier, no.

So the allowed are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. So all of these except for b, t.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes all except for b and t, but includes c.

Option B is X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So that's correct.

Wait, but option B includes c, but the problem is, the Lagrangian: is X coupling to the charm quark? Because the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = ... well, perhaps the interaction term is written as -λ f f(y) (ῡ + X) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the notation here is a bit confusing. Oh, maybe f and ψ_f represent different fermions. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is flavor-universal, meaning that X can couple to any fermion.

Wait, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So X interacts with all fermions f, so the decay channels are all possible f f̄ pairs where 2m_f <= m_X.

So the correct decay channels are all the allowed ones I listed, which correspond to option B.

Wait, but looking at option B: "c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ^{+}τ^{-}, μ^{+}μ^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}". So yes, that's correct.

Thus, the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The decays \( X \to f \bar{f} \) are allowed if the mass of \( X \) is at least twice the mass of the fermion \( f \), i.e., \( m_X \geq 2m_f \). 

### Step 1: Analyze the fermion masses
The masses of known fermions are approximately:
- \( e \) (electron): \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( \mu \) (muon): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( \tau \) (tau): \( 1777 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \))
- \( u \) (up quark): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( d \) (down quark): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( s \) (strange quark): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( c \) (charm quark): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \) (bottom quark): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \) (top quark): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

For \( X \) to decay into \( f \bar{f} \), \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). This eliminates \( b \) and \( t \), as their masses are too large.

### Step 2: Identify allowed decays
The allowed fermions for \( X \to f \bar{f} \) are:
- \( e \), \( \mu \), \( \tau \) (leptons)
- \( u \), \( d \), \( s \), \( c \) (quarks)

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays are:
\[
X \to e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}, \, s \bar{s}, \, c \bar{c}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which matches the allowed decays. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B
