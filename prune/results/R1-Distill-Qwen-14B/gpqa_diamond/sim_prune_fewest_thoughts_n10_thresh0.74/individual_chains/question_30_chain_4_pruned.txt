Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when a compound absorbs light, it emits light at a different energy, right? Oh wait, but wait—no, I think when something emits light, it's usually because it's releasing energy. So if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, what does that mean about the energy it absorbed?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh right! The energy of the emitted photon must be less than the energy absorbed. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon with lower energy. So the absorbed light has higher energy than the emitted one.

So the question is about the absorbed light color. The emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I need to find out the energy of the absorbed photon. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, when a compound absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state to a higher one. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon with lower energy than the absorbed one. So the emitted photon is at lower energy than the absorbed one.

So the energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. That's the energy of the photon emitted when the molecule returns to its ground state from an excited state. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that.

But wait, what's the relationship between energy and wavelength? Oh right, E = hc/λ. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths
