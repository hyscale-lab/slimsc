Okay, so I've got this physics problem to tackle. Let's see what it's about. The question is about comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism involves the interaction of magnetic fields with electrons, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The situation is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, and for hydrogen, the possible values of m depend on the orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Small values of m, so maybe m is much smaller than l or something like that. But I'm not sure how that plays into the problem yet.

The problem says to compare the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value, which I think is the energy shift due to the magnetic field, with the transition energy ΔE. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that's the Balmer series wavelength for hydrogen, the H-alpha line, which corresponds to the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, Balmer is from n=3 to n=2, right? Wait no, Balmer alpha is n=3 to n=2, which is about 656 nm, but wait, 0.486 micrometers is about 486 nm, that's the H-beta line, n=4 to n=2. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm getting the series confused. Let me think: Lyman series is n=2 to n=1 (121 nm), Balmer is n=3 to n=2 (656 nm), and H-alpha is the first line of the Balmer series. H-beta is n=4 to n=2, which is 486 nm. So the transition here is ΔE corresponding to wavelength 486 nm.

So the energy ΔE can be found using the photon energy formula: ΔE = hc/λ. Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = let's calculate that. Let me compute the numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = approx 4.089e-18 J.

Wait, that's the energy in joules. To get it in terms of eV, I can divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV. So 4.089e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 25.5 eV. Wait that can't be right because the energy levels of hydrogen are much smaller. Wait, wait, I think I messed up a calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 is indeed 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 486.1e-9 meters: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx 4.089e-19 J. Because 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18, but 486.1 is about 5e2, so 1.9878e-25 / (4.861e-7) = 1.98
