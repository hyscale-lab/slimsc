Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about naming a benzene ring with multiple substituents. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question describes a benzene ring with several groups attached: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is like an aldehyde group), and a cyano group. All three of these are meta to each other. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (OH) group and a dimethyl amino group. Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Also, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano) group. And the main chain is a benzoic acid, so the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group.

Hmm, I remember that when naming benzene derivatives, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. The principal functional group (in this case, the carboxylic acid) gets the lowest possible number, which is usually position 1.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. The benzene ring has a COOH group. Let's fix that as position 1. Then, the carbaldehyde (CHO) is meta to COOH. Since COOH is 1, meta would be position 4. Wait, no. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If COOH is at position 1, then the meta positions would be 3 and 5? Wait, no. Let me think: in a benzene ring, positions 1, 3, 5 are all meta to each other? No, each substituent is meta to another if they are two carbons apart. So if COOH is at 1, a meta substituent would be at 3 or 4? Wait, no. Wait, each substituent has two meta positions. For example, substituent at position 1 has meta positions at 3 and 5. Wait, no, because moving two positions in either direction. So 1 → 3 (two positions clockwise), and 1 → 6 (two counterclockwise?), no, wait, maybe I'm confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the ring as a hexagon with positions 1 through 6. Let's say position 1 is the COOH. Then, meta positions would be positions 3 and 5. So the carbaldehyde (CHO) and the cyano group (CN) are both meta to COOH. So they must be at positions 3 and 5.

Wait, but the question says all three are meta to each other. Wait, the COOH, the CHO, and the CN are all meta to one another. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. Because if COOH is at position 1, then the other two substituents (CHO and CN) must each be at a position that's meta to each other as well. So if COOH is 1, then one substituent is at 3, and the other at 5. Because 3 and 5 are meta to each other (since they are two positions apart from each other as well). So that way, all three substituents are meta to each other.

So COOH is at 1, CHO at 3
