Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again. 

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. 

Hmm, wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is [CaEDTA]^2-, right? So the formula of the complex would be something like CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA part.

The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So the complex dissociates a bit, releasing some Ca^2+ ions. But because the formation constant is so large (5x10^10), the complex is very stable, meaning not much dissociation. So the free Ca^2+ concentration should be really low.

I think the formula for the formation constant K is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA]). But wait, in this case, the solution is of the Ca-EDTA complex, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaY^2-] as 0.02 M.

Assuming that the complex dissociates as follows: CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. Wait, but EDTA is usually in a deprotonated form in such complexes. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe the concentration of free EDTA is not an issue here? Or perhaps the EDTA is present in excess, so that [Y] is approximately equal to the initial EDTA concentration? Hmm, not sure. Wait, no, the [CaY] is 0.02 M, and we're assuming that all the Ca and EDTA are tied up in the complex. Or wait, no. Because if EDTA is in excess, then the [Y] is approximately constant, but the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, meaning the concentrations are in a 1:1 ratio. Oh wait, but if it's stoichiometric, then the
