Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various power laws based on 1 over plx raised to some exponent. Let me think step by step.

I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller. Like, plx = 1/distance, right?

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, I guess I need to find out how the number of stars depends on parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their spatial density is uniform. Wait, no, the question says they are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, maybe the density is uniform in space, but how does that translate to parallax?

Wait, no. Uniformly distributed in the sky doesn't necessarily mean uniformly distributed in space. Wait, the question says "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." Hmm, so perhaps they're spread out evenly on the celestial sphere. But when considering their distance, which affects parallax, that might change how many we observe in a certain parallax range.

Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a certain volume depends on their density. If the density is uniform, then the number of stars should be proportional to the volume. But how does that translate to parallax?

Parallax relates to distance. The formula plx = 1/d (in arcseconds and parsecs, respectively). So, as d increases, plx decreases. So, if I have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx (a small change), what's the corresponding distance?

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's imagine that the number of stars per unit volume is n (a constant because uniform distribution). So the number of stars in a small volume element dV would be n*dV.

But how does dV relate to parallax? Let's think in terms of distance. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π d^2 dd, I think. So, for a given distance d, the volume element is 4π d² dd. But wait, that's the volume of a thin shell at distance d with
