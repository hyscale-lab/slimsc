Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says that there are three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3—each with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I don't think that's directly relevant to solving this problem, so maybe I can set that aside for now.

The important data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and their masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So, Planet2's equilibrium temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet1. Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is 2.3. So Planet3's temperature is 2.3 times Planet2's. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when it says the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, that would mean Planet2 is hotter, right? Because if Planet2 were the same as Planet1, the ratio would be 1. So Planet2 is hotter by 0.4 times Planet1's temperature. Similarly, Planet3 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet2, so Planet3 is even hotter.

The mass ratios are also given. Planet1 and Planet2 have a mass ratio of around 1.15. So Planet2 is 15% more massive than Planet1. Then, the mass ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet3 is 35% more massive than Planet2, which makes Planet3 the most massive of the three.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. And all three have the same albedo, which is 0.3, similar to Earth's. I think albedo affects the equilibrium temperature, but since it's the same for all, maybe it cancels out in the ratios.

Hmm, so I'm trying to think about the factors that determine the orbital period. I remember Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. The formula is usually given as P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star, and a is the semi-major axis. Since all planets orbit the same star (I assume), M is constant for each planet. So the period depends on the semi-major axis.

Wait, but in this problem, we don't have any information about the semi-major axes of the planets. Hmm. But perhaps we can find the ratio of the periods based on the given temperature and mass ratios.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature formula is something like T = [(L(1 - A))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star (semi-major axis for circular orbits). Since albedo A is the same for all planets, L and D must vary to give different temperatures.

So, the equilibrium temperature (T) is proportional to sqrt(L) / D^(
