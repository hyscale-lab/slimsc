Okay, I'm faced with this chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let's try to break down the reactions step by step.

First, let me outline what each reaction is telling me.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests it's an 8:1 molar ratio. So, maybe A has a formula that when combined with B in this ratio, forms C. Bright red product makes me think of something like copper-based compounds, maybe CuO or Cu2O, but those are more reddish. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else. Wait, another thought—could this be a reaction involving sulfur? Like, maybe A is FeS or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Think about the reactions of C. When C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. That suggests that C might be a salt that can hydrolyze. For example, maybe a sulfide or another compound that can produce different acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, let's think about F and G. Strong acid is like H2SO4 or HCl, weak is like CH3COOH or something. Alternatively, if F is H2SO4 and G is H2S, but that doesn't fit. Wait, but if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then when it reacts with water, maybe it doesn't do much. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, and when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (which is a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide, which might not fit. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about product E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. And E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas. Alternatively, maybe chlorine or something similar. Wait, but another possibility is SO3, but that's a gas perhaps under certain conditions. Hmm.

Wait, the other reaction is D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents could be something like water (H2O), ethanol (C2H5OH), or something else. But D and B in 1:1 to form H. Let's think: if B is a gas, perhaps something like H2 gas? No, wait, because the reaction is with D.

Wait, step back. Let's try to figure out what each substance could be.

Looking at the first reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Let's think about metals that form red compounds when reacted with something. Copper comes to mind. For example, copper(II) oxide is black, but copper(I) oxide is red. So, maybe when A is Cu, and B is something that reacts to form Cu2O (which is red). Wait, but 8 equivalents. So, if A is Cu and B is something like NH3 or another ligand, but not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is Fe, and B is S. FeS is a dark solid, but FeS is more black. Hmm. Alternatively, if B is O2, but 8 equivalents seems too high. Wait, maybe it's a reaction where A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. For example, if A is Fe and B is Cl2, 8 equivalents would mean Fe + 4 Cl2 → FeCl4? But FeCl4 is more of a solution thing, not sure about solid.

Wait, another approach. Think about the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. So C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Also, D reacting with B to form H, a solvent. So, D and B combine in 1:1 to make a solvent. Let's think of possible solvents. Water is a solvent, but that would require B and D to combine into H2O. So if B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O. Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, same thing.

Wait, but D and B are gases reacting in 1:1 to form a solvent. Another possibility is if B is Cl2 and D is something else, but H is a solvent like CHCl3? No, that doesn't fit 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 (a gas) and D is something else. Wait, but ammonia is a gas under certain conditions. For example, if B is NH3 and D is HCl, then H would be NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O vapor (but it's a gas) and D is something else.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the reaction of C with water giving two acids. So when C reacts with water, it produces F and G, which are acids. Suppose F is H2SO4 and G is H2S. Then, perhaps C is a sulfide salt. Wait, but sulfides reacting with water usually produce H2S and the metal hydroxide. So maybe if C is something like FeS, then FeS + 2 H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S↑. But then A would be Fe, and the reaction with B would form FeS, but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide, but that doesn't explain the two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. If A is something like S, and B is something else. Wait, let's think: if A is S (solid sulfur), and B is O2 (gas), then 8 equivalents would mean S + 8 O2 → SO4^2-, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps A is FeS, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reactions leading to product E. Let's say C reacts with D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. So E could be something like H2S, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe it's something like SO2 or another toxic gas.

Wait, but E is a product of C and D. If C is a sulfide, say FeS, and D is Cl2, then FeS + Cl2 might form something. But I'm not sure about the products. Alternatively, if C is a metal oxide, and D is a halogen, perhaps forming a halide.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, and D is something else. Wait, but when C reacts with water, it gives two acids. If C is a sulfate salt, like Na2SO4, then reacting with water would not produce acid. Wait, unless it's a different kind of salt.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. For example, Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, does that produce anything? Not really, unless it's hydrolyzing. Or perhaps C is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if A is N2 and B is H2, but 8 equivalents would be H2: N2 + 8 H2 → NH2– something? Not sure.

Wait, another thought. Let me consider the symmetry groups. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are all symmetry point groups. D∞h suggests a linear molecule with infinite symmetry, like CO2. Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, wait, CO2 is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, right. But what about something like SO2? SO2 has a bent structure, so its point group is D2h or something else.

Wait, but if E is a molecule with D∞h symmetry, it's linear. So what could E be? Maybe SO3? No, SO3 is trigonal pyramidal. Alternatively, maybe something like O2 or O3. O2 is diatomic, so it has D∞h symmetry. But O2 is a gas, so could E be O2? But then how would C and D reacting form O2? That doesn't fit because O2 is an element, not a compound.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2 or O2. Alternatively, maybe E is something like H2O, but H2O is a solvent, and H is a solvent. Wait, in the problem, H is the product of D and B. So if H is a solvent, like H2O, then D and B must combine to form H2O. So what if B is H2 and D is O2. Then D and B (O2 and H2) react in 1:1 ratio to form H2O (but H2O is a liquid, not a gas, but maybe under certain conditions it's a gas). Alternatively, perhaps H is something else, like ethanol, but that would require D and B being more complex.

Let me try to fit everything together.

If H is H2O, then B and D must be H2 and O2 (since 1:1 ratio would give H2O). Then, D is O2 and B is H2.

So, let's see. Reaction of A with 8 equivalents of H2 gas forms C (bright red). Hmm, if A is a metal, like Fe, and B is H2, then Fe + H2 → FeH2? No, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, Fe3O4 reacting with H2 to form Fe and water. But that doesn't fit the 8 equivalents.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is CuO, and B is H2. CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS + H2 → Fe + H2S. But again, the ratio doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps A is a more complex sulfide. Let's say A is FeS, and B is O2. 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with FeS. But that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas that forms a metal oxide. So, A could be Fe, B could be O2. Fe + O2 (in 8 equivalents?) → FeO? But FeO is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is a sulfide, then when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. For example, CuS reacting with water doesn't do much, but perhaps another sulfide. Alternatively, if C is Na2S, then Na2S + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2S↑. So F would be NaOH (but that's a base, not an acid). Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe C is a sulfide of a metal that forms a strong acid when hydrolyzed. Wait, but sulfides typically produce the corresponding metal hydroxide and H2S.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. For example, if A is S (sulfur), and B is O2, then S + O2 → SO3^2- or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the products again. When C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G, where F is strong acid and G is weak. So, C must be a salt that upon hydrolysis gives two acids. Hmm, that's tricky. Maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. But H2SO3 is a weak acid. So F would be NaOH (a strong base, not acid), which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, then Mg3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Mg(OH)2 + 2 NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. Na2CO3 reacts with water to produce 2 NaOH and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), but NaOH is a strong base. So F would be NaOH (base), which doesn't match F being a strong acid.

Hmm, this isn't working. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about the possible products E. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous compounds? Maybe something like sarin gas, but I don't think that's relevant. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCl, but HCl isn't that hazardous in small amounts. Or maybe it's a nerve agent, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, another possibility: E is O3 (ozone). Ozone is a toxic gas. But how would C and D react to form O3? Let me think: Ozone is formed from O2 via some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the symmetry of E. The options are symmetry groups, which can help identify E.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's a linear molecule. So, possible candidates are O2, O3 (but O3 is bent, so its symmetry is D2h), CO2 (linear, D∞h symmetry), HCN (linear), etc.

Wait, but O2 is diatomic, so it has D∞h symmetry. But how would E be O2? Because O2 is a diatomic gas, and in the reaction, C and D would have to produce O2. Wait, but then D is O2, because in the reaction where D and B form H (a solvent), and if D is O2, then B would have to be H2, because O2 + H2 → H2O (solvent). That fits. So if H is H2O, then D is O2 and B is H2.

Now, let's see: If D is O2, then reaction C + 2 D → E would be C + 2 O2 → E. So E is formed when C reacts with O2. But E is extremely hazardous. Let's think about what C could be. If C is a sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with O2 would produce FeO and SO3 or something. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like NH3, but not sure.

Wait, alternatively, suppose C is a metal sulfide. If C is Cu2S, then reacting with O2 would produce CuO and SO2 or something. Wait, let me think:

Cu2S + O2 → 2 CuO + SO2? But SO2 is a gas, which could be E. Is SO2 extremely hazardous? Yes, it's toxic. So E would be SO2.

What's the symmetry group of SO2? SO2 is a bent molecule, so its point group is D2h. But wait, the options don't include D2h. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because if E is SO2, then symmetry group is D2h, which isn't an option. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, another possibility: If E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure, symmetry group D2h as well. Still not matching the options.

Wait, another thought. Maybe E is a linear molecule. If E is Cl2, then it's diatomic, symmetry group D∞h. But Cl2 isn't extremely hazardous in small amounts, but it's a toxic gas. Alternatively, maybe E is a different diatomic molecule.

Wait, but let's think again. If D is O2, then C could be something that reacts with O2 to form a diatomic gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's try to figure out what C is. If C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G, with F being a strong acid and G a weak one, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NaHSO4, then NaHSO4 + H2O → NaOH + H2SO4. Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, and NaOH is a base, which doesn't fit because G is a weak acid. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate salt. For example, if C is NaHSO3, which would react with water to form H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), but that doesn't fit F and G being acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), and NaOH is a strong base. But again, F and G are acids, not base.

Hmm, perhaps C is a nitrate. NaNO3 reacts with water to form NaOH and HNO3? Wait, but that's not how nitrates hydrolyze. Nitrates usually don't hydrolyze much; they're stable.

Wait, another thought. Maybe C is a sulfide. Let me say C is FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze much under normal conditions, but maybe under acidic conditions, it produces H2S. But in this case, it's just reacting with water, so maybe it produces Fe(OH)2 and H2S. Fe(OH)2 is a weak base, so perhaps it's not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate. If C is NaH2PO4, then NaH2PO4 + H2O → NaOH + H3PO4. H3PO4 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. But again, F and G are acids.

I'm stuck on this part. Maybe I should think about another aspect.

Looking back, D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. H is a solvent, so perhaps H is H2O. So D and B must be O2 and H2, because O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. Wait, that would be a 2:2 ratio, but the problem says 1:1. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3, which is a solvent. Then D and B would be something like N2 and H2, but that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe H is ethanol, but that would require D and B to be something else.

Wait, perhaps H is something else. Let's think: what solvents are formed from 1:1 reactions between two gases? Maybe HCl and NH3? No, that would form NH4Cl, which is a solid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is HF. But HF is a weak acid, not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O, but earlier calculation didn't fit 1:1.

Wait, perhaps the reaction between B and D is 2 B + D → H. So, but the problem states 1:1.

Wait, maybe the reaction is B + D → H, 1:1. Let's think of possible H as a solvent.

If H is HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, H is CH4 (but that's a gas). Hmm. Perhaps H is a liquid like CCl4, but I don't see how gases would form that.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is C (carbon monoxide), but that would form CO2, which is a gas, not a solvent.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach it differently.

Let me consider the possible E. The options for symmetry groups are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure, like SO2, its point group is D2h, which isn't an option. If E is a linear molecule like CO2, symmetry is D∞h (option C). So perhaps E is CO2.

But how would C and D react to form CO2? Let me see: C + 2 D → CO2.

If D is O2, then C must be a compound that upon reaction with O2 gives CO2. For example, if C is carbon (solid), then carbon reacting with O2 would form CO2, but that would require D to be O2 and C to be carbon. But then the first reaction would be A + 8 B → C (carbon). So what would A and B be in that case? If A is carbon solid, and B is something else.

Wait, but the first reaction is A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). If C is carbon, which is black, not bright red. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CuO. Wait, CuO is black, not red. But bright red makes me think of Cu2O. So, perhaps C is Cu2O.

Wait, let me think again. If C is Cu2O, which is bright red, then when it reacts with water, it would produce... wait, Cu2O is not very reactive with water. Maybe under acidic conditions, it would produce Cu^2+ ions and H2O. But according to the problem, it produces A, F, and G, which are acids. So perhaps Cu2O reacts with water to form CuO, H2O, and something else. Not sure.

Wait, another thought. Let's think about the reaction where C is a metal oxide. Suppose C is FeO. FeO is a black solid. Doesn't fit the bright red.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide, but then when it reacts with water, it produces H2S and the metal hydroxide. So, F could be H2S (weak acid), and G would be the hydroxide (but that's a base, not an acid). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is taking too long. Let me try to make some educated guesses.

If E has D∞h symmetry, which is linear, then E could be CO2, O2, or another linear molecule. Since E is extremely hazardous, let's say E is CO2. But why would C and D react to form CO2?

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3, but as I said earlier, O3 is bent, not linear.

Wait, another possibility: E is Cl2. Cl2 is diatomic, D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is a toxic gas. How would C and D form Cl2? Let's think: if D is Cl2, then C would need to be something that when reacted with Cl2 gives Cl2. That doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, if D is Cl2, then reaction with B in 1:1 ratio would form H, which is a solvent. So B + Cl2 → H (solvent). Let's say H is HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, if H is CCl4, but that would require B to be something like CH4 and D as Cl2, but I don't see a 1:1 reaction making CCl4.

Wait, perhaps the reactions are as follows:

1. A + 8 B → C (bright red).

2. C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous).

3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

4. B + D → H (solvent) in 1:1 ratio.

If H is H2O, then B and D must be O2 and H2 in a 2:1 ratio, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, if H is NH3, then B and D could be N2 and H2, but that's a 3:1 ratio, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol), but then B and D would need to be something like CO and H2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH4, but that's a gas, not a solvent.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think of E with symmetry group D∞h, which is option C. So E would be a linear molecule. CO2 is linear, has D∞h symmetry, and is a gas. But would E be CO2? How?

If E is CO2, then C + 2 D → CO2.

If D is O2, then C would need to be a compound that when reacted with O2 gives CO2. For example, if C is carbon (solid), then carbon + O2 → CO2. But earlier reaction would be A + 8 B → C (carbon). So A would be carbon, and B would be O2? But 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with carbon to form CO? Or CO2? Let's see: 2 C + O2 → 2 CO (1 eq O2), but 8 equivalents of O2 would imply more CO2.

Wait, the reaction 2 C + 3 O2 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O? No, that's for combustion. Wait, but solid A (carbon) reacting with 8 equivalents of O2 (gas B) to form C (bright red). But the product of carbon + O2 is CO or CO2, which are gases, not solids. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe C is a carbonate. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't decompose. Hmm.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of E as SO2, but symmetry is D2h. Not an option. So perhaps the correct symmetry is D4h or C2v.

Wait, another possibility: If E is SO3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure. Its point group is D3h. Not in the options.

Wait, another thought: E could be a linear molecule like HCN. HCN is linear, so D∞h symmetry. But is HCN extremely hazardous? Yes, it's a highly toxic gas. So E could be HCN.

How would C and D react to form HCN? Let's think: C + 2 D → HCN.

If D is H2O, but D is a gas. Alternatively, D could be H2S. But not sure.

Hmm, this is taking too long, and I'm not making progress. I'll make an educated guess based on the options and possible reactions.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's a linear molecule. So CO2 is a possibility, but I'm not sure about the reactions. Alternatively, O2 is D∞h, but O2 isn't extremely hazardous in small amounts. Wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. If E is O2, but that doesn't fit because O2 is a gas, and it's not extremely hazardous in small quantities. Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, which is a diatomic, D∞h symmetry, and toxic.

Wait, but how would C and D form Cl2? Let's say C is ClO (chlorine monoxide), and D is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Cl2O7 (chlorate?), but that's probably not relevant.

I think I'm getting stuck, so I'll make a guess based on the options. The likely answer is D∞h symmetry, which is option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E, which is described as extremely hazardous. To solve this, the reactions and properties of the substances are analyzed step by step:

1. **Reaction of A with 8 equivalents of B to form C (bright red):**  
   The bright red color suggests a compound like Cu₂O (copper(I) oxide). This aligns with the idea that A could be copper-based, and B might be a gas like oxygen (O₂) or another oxidizing agent.

2. **Reaction of C with 2 equivalents of D to form E (extremely hazardous):**  
   E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to highly toxic compounds. Possible candidates include SO₂, Cl₂, or HCN. These are all toxic gases or liquids.

3. **Reaction of C with water to reform A plus two acids F and G:**  
   F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. This suggests that C is a salt that hydrolyzes to produce acids. For example, if C is Cu₂O, it could hydrolyze to form Cu(OH)₂ and H₂O, but this does not perfectly align with the description of F and G.

4. **Reaction of B and D in a 1:1 ratio to form H (a solvent):**  
   H is a solvent, so it could be water (H₂O), ethanol (C₂H₅OH), or another liquid. If H is water, B and D might be gases like H₂ and O₂, respectively.

5. **Symmetry group of E:**  
   The options for molecular symmetry groups are **C₂**, **D₄h**, **D∞h**, and **C₂v**.  
   - **C₂** corresponds to a molecule with two-fold rotational symmetry.  
   - **D₄h** corresponds to a molecule with four-fold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane.  
   - **D∞h** corresponds to a linear molecule with infinite symmetry, such as CO₂ or O₂.  
   - **C₂v** corresponds to a molecule with two-fold rotational symmetry and a vertical mirror plane.  

   Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, a plausible candidate is **Cl₂** (chlorine gas), which is diatomic and has **D∞h** symmetry. Another possibility is **CO₂**, which is linear and also has **D∞h** symmetry. Both Cl₂ and CO₂ fit the description of extremely hazardous substances and align with the **D∞h** symmetry group.

Based on the analysis, the most consistent answer is that E has **D∞h** symmetry. 

Answer: C
