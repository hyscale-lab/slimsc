Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ, and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants is important for determining renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. If any have a negative dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable, meaning it's effective only at low energies.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the mass dimension of κ here. 

I think I should start by recalling the mass dimensions of the fields involved. Let me list them:

- The Dirac field ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because ψ is a spinor, which is a fermion, and in four spacetime dimensions, the dimension is (3+1)/2 = 3/2. So [ψ]_M = 3/2.

- The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from electromagnetism or non-Abelian gauge fields. For a gauge field A, the field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ + ... (I think for Abelian it's just the first two terms). The dimension of F is [mass]^2 since A has dimension 1 (because it's a vector field in four dimensions; each derivative is mass dimension 1, so F is second order in derivatives).

Wait, no, actually, let me correct that. The gauge field A^μ has mass dimension 1 because it's a vector field, so each component is like a scalar with dimension 1. The covariant derivative Dμ = ∂μ + i e A, so A must have the same dimension as ∂μ, which is mass^1. Therefore, F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each term has two derivatives, so F has dimension 2. Correct.

Now, what about σ_{μν}? The problem states σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γμ, γν]. The gamma matrices γμ are dimensionless (they're just matrices), so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So [σ]_M = 0.

So putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ (which is the conjugate of ψ, so same dimension as ψ, 3/2), times σ_{μν} (dimension 0), times ψ (dimension 3/2), times F^{μν} (dimension 2).

So the entire term without κ is ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let me compute the mass dimension of that product.

Compute [ψ̄]_M [σ]_M [ψ]_M [F]_M = (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, but wait—no, the product is the multiplication of the fields. So each field contributes its dimension, but I have to add them up correctly.

Wait, the Lagrangian is a scalar, so the entire term must have mass dimension 4 since the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions (since the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over four dimensions, so each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4).

So, the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4. Let's compute the dimensions of each part.

κ is the coupling we're interested in. ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. σ is dimensionless.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions: (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the product has dimension 5. But the entire term must have dimension 4, so κ must contribute a dimension of 4 -5 = -1.

So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, but wait, the product is without κ: [ψ̄] [σ] [ψ] [F] = (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the term without κ is dimension 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So κ must have dimension [4 -5] = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

So κ is dimension -1. Then, what about renormalizability? I remember that in renormalizable theories, the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≥ 0. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The mass dimension of the coupling in a renormalizable theory must have a non-negative dimension because otherwise, the interaction becomes more relevant (or irrelevant, but irrelevant is another term). Wait, no, the correct way is that each interaction term in the Lagrangian must have a dimension ≤ 4 (which they do, since the Lagrangian itself is dimension 4). But more precisely, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions (or are dimensionless) because that allows only a finite number of terms in the renormalization group equations. Wait, no, actually, the condition is that the coupling's mass dimension must be greater than or equal to zero. Wait, no—what's the exact condition?

Wait,
