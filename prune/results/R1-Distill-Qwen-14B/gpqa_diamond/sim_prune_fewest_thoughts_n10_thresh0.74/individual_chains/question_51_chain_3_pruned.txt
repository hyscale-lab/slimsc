Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: A charge q is placed at a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, potential energy in electrostatics... I remember that the potential energy of a charge in an electric field is the work done to bring it there. But here, there are two charges involvedâ€”the external charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, the sphere is grounded. So any induced charges on the sphere would be neutralized by the ground, right? Or does grounding affect the potential? Oh, right, a grounded conductor has its potential set to zero. So the conducting sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded.

When a charge q is placed near the sphere, charges will be induced on the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting, the charges will redistribute on the surface. But because it's grounded, the total charge on the sphere remains zero. So the induced charges are such that the sphere remains neutral overall.

Wait, but how does that affect the potential energy? The potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. So here, we're bringing charge q from infinity and placing it at distance d from the sphere's center. Then, the sphere's induced charges will contribute to the potential at the point where q is placed, and vice versa.

Alternatively, I remember that the potential energy when a charge is placed near a spherical conductor can be found using the method of images or by considering the induced charges
