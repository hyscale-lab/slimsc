Okay, so I've got this question about genetics and molecular biology. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using Chinese hamster ovary cells with a plasmid they transfected using Lipofectamine. They introduced a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. But when they try to express the protein, it doesn't overexpress as expected. They're looking into why and found that the plus strand of their construct has a specific sequence.

Looking at the options, the possible reasons for the failure of overexpression include a mutation in the antigenic determinant, early translation termination, proteolysis due to a missing linker, or a missing tRNA for a stop codon.

Hmm, the given DNA sequence is the coding (plus) strand. Let me think about how to analyze this. 

First, the construct includes a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence starts with that tag followed by the GADD45G sequence. If the issue is in the tag, maybe it's causing the ribosome to terminate early. Alternatively, maybe the stop codon is causing a problem.

Looking at the DNA sequence, I should check for in-frame stop codons. The plus strand is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. So I can translate the DNA into mRNA and then into protein to see if there are any stop codons.

Wait, but DNA is read in triplets, complementary to the mRNA. Let me pick a part of the sequence to check for stop codons. Let's see, the beginning of the sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA...

Wait, so the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC GGA...

ATG is the start codon (methionine). Then TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again, then GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAT (aspartic acid), TAC (tyrosine), GCC (alanine), AAA (lysine), TGA (stop codon). Oh, wait, TGA is a stop codon. So in the DNA, the coding strand has TGA at position... let me count.
