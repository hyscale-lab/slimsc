Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So, I need to check each compound to see if they have any chiral centers or some kind of other asymmetry like a planar chirality.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, this is an alkene with substituents on both carbons. The configuration is Z, which means the higher priority groups are on the same side. But for a molecule to be chiral, it needs a chiral center. Let me think. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but the double bond is from C1 to C2. So, C1 is Cl attached, and C2 has a methyl. Let me draw it: the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a CH2 and a CH3 group? Wait, no, but wait, wait. The formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, but actually, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl on C1, and
