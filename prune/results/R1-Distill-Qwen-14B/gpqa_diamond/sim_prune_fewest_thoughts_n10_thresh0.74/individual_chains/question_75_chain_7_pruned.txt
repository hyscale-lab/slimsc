Okay, I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. Let me think through what's happening here.

So, the setup is that the researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is overexpressed. They've introduced a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and used an antibiotic to select resistant colonies. But when they checked, the protein isn't being overexpressed as expected.

The problem is probably in the construct they made. The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand, which I'll need to analyze.

First, I remember that the coding sequence (CDS) starts with a start codon, which is ATG. Let me scan the sequence for that. Looking at the beginning: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTT... Hmm, the first part is ATG, so that's the start codon. So the reading frame should start there.

Wait, the first few nucleotides after ATG are TAC. Let's think about that. ATG is methionine, then TAC is tyrosine. So the next codon is TAC, which translates to tyrosine. But wait, the construct is supposed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus. The HA tag is usually a peptide derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. Commonly, the HA tag starts with a signal peptide or a specific amino acid sequence.

Wait a second, the first codon after the start is TAC (tyrosine), then CAT (histidine), then CGA (arginine). Wait, that doesn't look like the HA tag. Let me think about what the HA tag's DNA sequence would be. The HA tag is often encoded by the sequence YPYDVPVY, which in DNA would be TAC CAT CGA GTA CTA GTA TTA GTA. Wait, but maybe the actual HA tag is a specific sequence. Alternatively, perhaps the construct is designed to add the HA tag before the GADD45G start.

Wait, but the
