Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. So, let's think through this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be Li-6. Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons makes 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. But wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, another way: lithium has atomic number 3. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So yeah, X is Li-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The energy of the particles in the collider is related to their kinetic energy, but wait, in particle physics, when we talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Or is it just kinetic? I think in colliders, the energy given is the kinetic energy per particle, but I might be getting that mixed up. Wait, no—the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So gamma is the Lorentz factor.

The formula for the total energy E is E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, for a nucleus, the rest mass would be the mass of the entire nucleus, not just a single nucleon. Oh right, because the nucleus is moving as a whole. So the mass I use is the atomic mass, including all protons and neutrons.

So, to find the energy, I need to calculate gamma, then multiply by the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

The speed v is given as 0.96c. So I can calculate gamma using the formula:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Plugging v = 0.96c into that, v²/c² becomes (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.921
