Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde and going through several steps. I need to find out how many carbon atoms are in the final product, product 3.

First, let me break down each step.

The first step is treating trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide. Wait, methyl magnesium bromide is a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents usually add to carbonyl groups. So, trans-cinnamaldehyde has a carbonyl group. Let me visualize its structure.

Trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. Its structure is CH₂=CH-C(=O)H. The double bond is between the first and second carbons, and the configuration is trans. Wait, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Its structure is actually (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So, it's benzaldehyde with a CH₂=CH group attached. So structure: Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, I think it's Ph-CH₂-CH=O? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? Wait, no. No, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Prop-2-enal has the carbonyl at position 2. So, the aldehyde is at the end. So, it's CH₂=CH-C(=O)H, but with a phenyl group attached to the CH₂. No, wait, that's not right. Let me get this
