Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have entropy, right? It's related to the area of the event horizon or something like that.

The problem says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, with exponents ranging from 59 to 66.

Wait, how do I approach this? I think I should start by finding the radius of the event horizon. The angular size θ is given, and distance d. I remember that the formula for angular size is θ ≈ (size) / distance, but I need to get the units right.

Oh right, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size (s) divided by the distance (d). So, s ≈ θ * d. But θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first because the formula requires radians.

Let me do the unit conversions. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 10^-17 degrees * (π/180) radians/degree. Let me calculate that: 10^-17 * π ≈ 3.14e-17 * 1e-17? Wait, no, 10^-17 multiplied by 3.14/180. Let me compute 3.1416/180 is approximately 0.01745 radians per degree. So θ_rad = 10^-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the size s is θ_rad * d. The distance d is 10^10 parsecs. Oh, wait, I need to convert parsecs to meters because the standard units for physics are meters, kilograms, seconds. How many meters are in a parsec? I recall that 1 parsec is approximately 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So s = θ_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.0857e26 m. Let's compute that: 1.745e-19 * 3.0857e26 = (1.745 * 3.0857) e7. Let me compute 1.745 *3.0857. 1.745 *3 is about 5.235, and 0.0857*1.745 is about 0.15. So total is approximately 5.385. So s ≈5.385e7 meters. Wait, 5.385e7 meters is 5.385e4 kilometers, which seems reasonable for a supermassive black hole—like, I think the event horizon radius is on the order of millions of kilometers perhaps, but maybe this is a small one? Hmm, not sure, but let's proceed.

Wait, actually, I think I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me recalculate: 1.745e-19 *3.0857e26 = (1.745 *3.0857) * 1e7 (because 1e-19 *1e26 is 1e7). So yeah, 1.745 *3.0857 is about 5.385, so 5.385e
