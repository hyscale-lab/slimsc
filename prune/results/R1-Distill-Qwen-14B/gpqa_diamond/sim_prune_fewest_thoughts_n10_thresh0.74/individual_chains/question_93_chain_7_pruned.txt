Okay, so I have this question about qPCR, and I'm a bit rusty on my knowledge, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He did three technical replicates for each of the serially diluted samples. The efficiency was 100%, RÂ² was 1, which means the curve fits perfectly, right? And the slope was -3.3. Hmm, wait, the slope in qPCR is usually negative because higher target amounts lead to lower CT values. I remember that the slope is related to efficiency, but I'm not exactly sure about the formula.

Looking at the data, for each concentration, there are three CT values. Let me list them out:

- 100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5
- 10000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2
- 1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9
- 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6
- 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3

So each time the concentration is tenfold less, the CT goes up by about 3.3. Like, 100000 to 10000 is a tenfold decrease, and the CT goes from around 34 to 30.6, so an increase of about 3.4. Similarly, each subsequent dilution increases the CT by about the same. So the differences between each consecutive dilution are consistent. But within each concentration, the replicates have a variation of about 0.3 to 0.6. For example, the 100000 sample's CTs are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5, which is a range of 0.6. Wait, but the options mention something about deviation between technical replicates.

Wait, the question is about the discrepancies in the results. So what's the issue here?

The options are:

A) qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. Well, that's not right because qPCR is used for quantification, especially with calibration curves. So A is probably incorrect.

B) Ct values don't agree with target amounts. But the data seems to fit a curve. The Ct decreases as concentration increases, so they do agree. So maybe B is not the right answer.

C) Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Hmm, the slope is -3.3, which is per the formula. The slope in the equation Ct = -slope * log(conc) + intercept. So a tenfold dilution (log10(10) = 1) would give a change of 3.3 in Ct. Because slope is -3.3, so each log10 decrease in concentration increases Ct by 3.3. Wait, so tenfold dilution corresponds to a 3.3 Ct difference. So option C says "Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles." Wait, 3.3 is exactly the slope, so I think that's correct. But wait, the question says what explains the discrepancies in his results. So perhaps the issue is that the dilution factor isn't matching the expected Ct change.

Wait, the Ct values are going up by approximately 3.3 each time he dilutes 10-fold. So the data fits the expected change, which would imply that the calibration curve is working as intended. But the question is about discrepancies in his results. Hmm, maybe the issue is that the technical replicates are varying more than expected.

Looking at the options again, D says the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replic
