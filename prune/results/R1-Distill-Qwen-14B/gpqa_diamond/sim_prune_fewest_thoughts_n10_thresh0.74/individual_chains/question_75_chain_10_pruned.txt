Okay, so I've got this question here about a mouse model study and some genetic engineering issues. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The scenario is that someone is trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein in mice. They're using a transgenic approach, modifying the gene to include a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a plasmid and are having trouble getting the protein to overexpress. When they look at the plus strand of their construct, they've noticed an issue.

The options given are A to D. I need to figure out which one is the problem.

First, let's recap some basics. The construct is a DNA plasmid that's been modified. When expressed, it should produce a protein that starts with the HA tag (from the influenza hemagglutinin) followed by GADD45G. The person is using Lipofectamine, which is a common transfection reagent. They selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, so the plasmid probably has a resistance gene.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressing. So why isn't it working?

Looking at the sequence they provided. Let me think about the structure of a gene. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then comes the coding sequence. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be the first part of the sequence before the GADD45G coding starts.

Wait, wait. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA's coding (non-template) strand. So the coding sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then the HA tag is added before the GADD45G gene. So looking at the sequence: the first part after ATG is TAC, which is tyrosine. Hmm, but HA tag is a specific sequence. Maybe I should check that.

Wait, no. The HA tag is a short peptide, usually from the influenza HA protein. The most common HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, but that's the amino acid sequence. The DNA coding sequence for that would be something like TAC ATG CTT GTA etc. Wait, but in this construct, the HA is being added at the N-terminus, so the DNA sequence should include that before the GADD45G coding.

Wait, but looking at the given sequence: the very first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (tyrosine), then CC (proline?), but wait, no, each codon is three letters. Let me parse the sequence into triplets.

So:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA CAG ATT ACC ... etc.

Wait, the first codon is ATG (start). Second is TAC, which is tyrosine. Third is CCA (proline), then TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), G
