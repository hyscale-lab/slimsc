Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. But in this scenario, that's possible. So how would that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. There are four of them. Let me recall them. Oh right:

1. Gauss's Law for Electric Fields: The divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0. So that's about the electric field's divergence. I think this equation deals with electric charge distribution.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields: The divergence of B is zero. Oh, right! In our universe, magnetic monopoles don't exist, so the magnetic field lines are continuous loops. So divergence of B is zero, meaning no magnetic charges.

3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is proportional to the negative rate of change of B. So this relates changing magnetic fields to electric fields.

4. Amp√®re's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of H is equal to the time derivative of E plus the current density. Or in another form, the curl of B is mu_0 times (J + epsilon_0 dE/dt). This includes the displacement current.

Wait, so in our universe, the first equation relates to electric charge, the second to the non-existence of magnetic charge, the third to induced electric fields from changing B, and the fourth to how B and E interact with currents.

In the question, this parallel universe allows isolated magnetic poles, so magnetic monopoles exist. That would impact the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism. Because in our world, div B = 0 because there are no monopoles. But with monopoles, div B would be something like rho_m (magnetic charge density) over some constant, similar to how Gauss's law for E includes electric charge.

So in this case, Maxwell's equation number 2 (the divergence of B) would change. The other equations might also change if there are magnetic currents, but wait, the question is about isolated poles, not currents. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If there are isolated magnetic charges (monopoles), then the divergence of B would not be zero. So equation 2 would change. But what about
