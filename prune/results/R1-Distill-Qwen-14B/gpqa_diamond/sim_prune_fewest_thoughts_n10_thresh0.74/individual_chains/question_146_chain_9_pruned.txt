Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think. The question is about reacting 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene with maleic anhydride. What's the major product?

Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile. Diels-Alder reactions! Right, that's the one. So the diene would react with the dienophile in a [4+2] cycloaddition. Wait, but what's the structure of 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene?

Oh right, cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds at positions 1 and 3. So the structure is like a cyclopentadiene. But wait, it's 5-fluoro, so the fluorine is on the fifth carbon. Let me draw it out mentally. Numbering the cyclopentane ring: positions 1,3, etc. So the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4. The fluorine is on carbon 5, which is adjacent to the 4-5 and 5-1 bonds. Wait, maybe I should visualize the structure. In cyclopentadiene, the double bonds are conjugated. But wait, wait, cyclopentene has one double bond; cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have two double bonds? Wait, no, 1
