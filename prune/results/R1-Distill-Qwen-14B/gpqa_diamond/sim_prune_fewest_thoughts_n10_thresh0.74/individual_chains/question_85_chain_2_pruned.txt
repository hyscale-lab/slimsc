Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits.

The planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. Oh wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. So the shifts they mentioned must relate to the RV signals. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a 0.04 Å shift. But the question is about equilibrium temperatures, so I'm not sure how much that comes into play here. Maybe the RV shifts are just there to provide the mass information, which we already have their masses, so perhaps not directly relevant for temperature. 

The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Both have the same albedo. So, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, but we don't have the planets' orbital distances. Hmm, how do I proceed?

Wait, the RV method gives the mass, but maybe the RV semi-amplitude can be used to find the distance if we know the star's mass. Oh, right, the RV method relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1/(1+M_p/M_star))^(1/3)

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, K is given by:

K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) * (P)^(-1/3) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1
