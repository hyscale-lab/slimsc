Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not super familiar with this notation, but I think it's about the interaction between the boson X and some fermions.

So, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. I remember that kinematically allowed means that the energy of the boson must be enough to produce the particles in the decay. So, for a decay X → f f̄, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f because each fermion gets some energy, but the minimum is when they're at rest, so sum to the mass.

Wait, but fermions like electrons, muons, taus, and quarks have different masses. Let me recall their masses. Electrons are about 0.511 MeV, muons around 105.7 MeV, taus about 1.78 GeV. For quarks: up and down are very light, maybe a few MeV, strange is around 100 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.7 GeV, top is super heavy, like 173 GeV.

So X is 6 GeV. For X to decay into a pair of fermions, each must have mass less than 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV would be allowed.

Let me list possible fermions:

- e⁻: 0.511 MeV → way under 3 GeV. So e+ e- is allowed.
- mu⁻: ~105 MeV → allowed.
- tau⁻: 1.78 GeV → 3 GeV threshold? Wait, no: tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2 * 1.78 is 3.56 GeV. Oh wait, wait, because X is 6 GeV, so even if the fermion is 1.78 GeV, two of them would sum to 3.56, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait wait, no: the sum of the fermion masses needs to be less than the mass of X. So if X is 6 GeV, the sum 2m_f must be less than 6 GeV. So m_f must be less than 3 GeV.

So, tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2 * 1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

Quarks: Let's see.

- u and d: very light, so their pairs are allowed.
- s quark: mass around 100 MeV, so 200 MeV < 6 GeV → allowed.
- c quark: about 1.5 GeV, 3 GeV sum → wait, 2 * 1.5 is 3 GeV. Oh, but X is 6 GeV, so 3 GeV is okay because 6 GeV is bigger. So c c̄ is allowed.
- b quark: about 4.7 GeV. 2 * 4.7 is 9.4 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So b b̄ is not allowed. Because 9.4 >6, so X can't decay into b b̄. So any options that include b b̄ would be incorrect.

Top quark is way heavier, so decay into t t̄ is impossible.

So the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, up, down, strange, charm.

Wait, but wait: in the Lagrangian, the interaction term is written as -λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I'm not sure what the λ and the structure signifies, but perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction. So f is a fermion field, and ψ_f is perhaps the same? Maybe this indicates that the coupling is to fermions f. So the decay channels would be into any pair of fermions that the boson X can couple to, and for which the mass allows the decay.

Assuming that the coupling is allowed for all these fermions, then the decays would be to all possible fermion-antifermion pairs where the sum of their masses is less than 6 GeV.

So which options include these?

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, b is 4.7 GeV, so 2*4.7 is 9.4 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so this is not allowed. So Option A includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So c is 1.5 GeV → 3 GeV, which is less than 6. So allowed. So c c̄ is allowed. So B includes all allowed except b, which is correct.

Option C includes
