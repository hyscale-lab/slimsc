Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me see. Let me try to break it down.

First, I'll read through the question again to make sure I understand all the reactions.

So, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Then, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Wait, I think I need to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let's start by trying to identify each substance based on the reactions.

The first reaction: A + 8 B â†’ C. Let me think about possible reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with oxygen? Or maybe a metal reacting with a diatomic gas.

Wait, when a metal reacts with chlorine, like maybe aluminum with Cl2? But aluminum reacts in a 4:3 ratio? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe something like the formation of a compound with a higher ratio.

Wait, another thought: if C is bright red, that makes me think of something like iron(III) oxide, but that's a solid. Or maybe a compound like sulfur trioxide? No, that's a liquid. Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a compound like TiCl3 or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, Fe reacting with Cl2. But FeCl3 is a dark color, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The product C when reacted with water gives back A and two acids. One strong, one weak. So if C is a salt that can hydrolyze into a strong acid and a weak acid.

If C is, say, a nitrate salt, because nitrate can hydrolyze into nitric acid (strong) and maybe another acid, but wait, nitrate tends to hydrolyze into HNO3 and something else? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfate?

Wait, if C is Al2(SO4)3, but when it reacts with water, it would give H2SO4, which is strong, but that
