Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me try to break this down.

First, I'll visualize the target structure. It's a benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering the ring, it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, meaning they are adjacent to each other in a meta arrangement? Or maybe it's a para arrangement? Wait, no, because all three are adjacent. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me number the positions: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So they're all ortho to each other? No, in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent to two others. So 1, 2, and 3 would form a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, meaning each substituent is next to two others. So it's like a meta arrangement for two substituents and another in between.

Wait, but the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So the nitro is at 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So the order in the name is given as 2-(tert-butyl), then 1-ethoxy, then 3-nitro.

Hmm, so substituents are adjacent. So the benzene ring has groups in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So, how would one synthesize this?

I think the synthesis steps would involve electrophilic substitution reactions because benzene tends to undergo those
