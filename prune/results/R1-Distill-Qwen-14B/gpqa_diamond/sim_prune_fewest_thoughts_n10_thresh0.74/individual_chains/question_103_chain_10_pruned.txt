Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which reaction sequence leads to the desired product. Let me start by understanding what the target molecule is. The compound given is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, it's a substituted phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5. Wait, benzene rings can be a bit tricky with numbering. Let me visualize the benzene ring: if the ketone is attached to the carbon at position 1, then the substituents would be on positions 3 and 5 relative to that. So the structure should be a benzene ring with a ketone group (as a substituent at position 1), a bromine at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5.

Now, the starting material is benzene. So I need to figure out the sequence of reactions that would introduce these substituents in the correct positions. Let me think about the directing effects of each substituent and how the reactions proceed.

The target molecule has two substituents besides the ketone: bromo and nitro. Nitro groups are meta-directing and strong deactivating. Bromine is ortho/para-directing but deactivating as well. The ketone group (like an acetyl group) is an electron-withdrawing group and is meta-directing.

Wait a second, the substituents are on the benzene ring attached to the ketone. So the order in which we add these substituents matters a lot because each new substituent will direct the next substitution.

Let me outline the possible steps. Benzene would first undergo some substitution. Let's consider the substituents needed.

The product has a ketone group (from ethan-1-one) attached to the benzene. So perhaps that's the first stepâ€”introducing the ketone group. But wait, ketones are typically introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. Benzene itself isn't activated, so the first substituent needs to be something that activates the ring for Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but nitro groups deactivate the ring. So if I add
