Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

So, the question says there are five exoplanets in a system, and they're in orbital resonance with orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They used the TTV method to discover them, but I don't think that part matters for the temperature calculation. The key here is that they're in resonance, and their periods are in this specific ratio.

The planets are designated Planet_1 to Planet_5. The question is about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Oh right, equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were perfectly absorbing and emitting energy, right? It's calculated based on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( ( L / (16πσ) )^0.25 ) * ( (1 - albedo) / (d^0.5) ) )^0.5, wait no, maybe I should think of it more simply. Oh, right, the formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R / (2a)), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Alternatively, another way to express it is T = T_star * ( ( (1 - albedo) ) / ( (16 π σ a²) ) )^0.25 ), but I'm not sure if I'm getting that right. Wait, maybe the simpler form is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), assuming the star's luminosity is L = 4πR²σT_eff^4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall. The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and the planet's albedo. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)). But wait, more accurately, I think the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R / (2a)), where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is T_eq = T
