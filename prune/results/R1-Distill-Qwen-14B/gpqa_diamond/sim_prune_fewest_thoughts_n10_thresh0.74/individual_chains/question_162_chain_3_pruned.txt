Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like something I've seen before. Oh right, sometimes metrics are written in terms of spatial components, and maybe this is a 2-dimensional metric because it only has dx and dy terms. But the question is about a pseudosphere—so maybe it's a surface in higher dimensions?

Wait, no, pseudosphere is a term I'm a bit confused about. I think in two dimensions, a pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic surface, maybe with negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, a pseudosphere could refer to a surface with constant negative curvature, which is different from a regular sphere which has positive curvature.

Let me get back to the metric. The general form for a metric in 2D is often expressed as ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ², but this one is in terms of x and y, so perhaps it's using Cartesian coordinates instead. Alternatively, maybe it's a conformally flat metric because it's written as a multiple of (dx² + dy²). Conformal metrics often appear in problems involving conformal transformations or in certain spacetimes, like the Rindler metric or parts of the Schwarzschild solution.

So, I
