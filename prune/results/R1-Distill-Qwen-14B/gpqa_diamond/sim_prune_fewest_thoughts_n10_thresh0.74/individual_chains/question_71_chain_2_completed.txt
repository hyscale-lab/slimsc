Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, found using the TTV method. They are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All planets have the same albedo, and we're to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. Oh right, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), but wait, that's assuming they have the same albedo and other factors. Or wait, maybe the formula is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ a²))^½? No, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T = T_eff * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^0.5 * ( L / (16 π σ a²) )^0.5? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key thing is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. Since all planets are around the same star, the L and sigma and other constants can be considered the same for all. So the main factor is distance.

Wait, the formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), but I'm not sure about the exact factors. Wait, the more precise formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (R / (2a)) ), but wait, R is the star's radius, but maybe it's the planet's orbital radius a. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the correct formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (R_star / (2a)) ), assuming the planet reflects like a perfect blackbody and that the star's light is uniform. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The standard formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where R is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital radius. But wait, in our case, all planets are around the same star, so R is the same for all. So the ratio of temperatures would be based on the square root of the inverse of their orbital radii.

But wait, the problem gives us the periods in a ratio, but not the radii. So I need to relate the period ratio to the radii. Oh right, Kepler's third law. The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. Since the orbits are circular, that's just the radius.

So Kepler's law: (P)^2 ∝ (a)^3. So a ∝ P^(2/3). So for each planet, their radius (a) is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2, which is T4/T2, the formula would involve sqrt(a2/(a4)), because T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Because T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).

Let's break it down. T_eq is proportional to (1 / sqrt(a)). So, T4 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a4).

Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), a2 is (P2/P1)^(2/3) times a1. Wait, no, wait the periods are given in ratios. Let me think: the period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, for each planet, their period is P1, P2=2 P1, P3=2.5 P1, P4=3.5 P1, P5=5 P1.

So, for each planet, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So, a2 is (P2/P1)^(2/3) * a1. Because a1 is for P1.

So a2 = (2)^(2/3) * a1.

Similarly, a4 = (3.5)^(2/3) * a1.

So the ratio a2/a4 is (2^(2/3)) / (3.5^(2/3)) ) = (2 / 3.5)^(2/3).

So, T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) ). Hmm, let me simplify that.

Wait, (2/3.5) is the same as (4/7), because 3.5 is 7/2. So 2/(7/2) = 4/7.

So (a2/a4) = (4/7)^(2/3).

So T4/T2 = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Because sqrt(x^a) = x^(a/2). So square root of (4/7)^(2/3) is (4/7)^(1/3).

So let's compute (4/7)^(1/3). 4 is 2^2, 7 is prime. So cube root of (4/7) = (4^(1/3)) / (7^(1/3)).

Calculating the approximate cube roots:

4^(1/3) ≈ 1.5874.

7^(1/3) ≈ 1.913.

So 1.5874 / 1.913 ≈ 0.829. So about 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't get the ratio wrong. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) because a4 is bigger than a2, so T4 would be lower than T2.

Wait, Planet 4 has a longer period than Planet 2. Because P4 is 3.5 which is more than P2's 2. So a4 > a2. So a4 is larger, so T4 would be lower than T2.

So in the ratio T4/T2, which is 0.83, that would be about 0.83, which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, which would make sense. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the ratio.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is T proportional to (1/a^0.5), so T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) as I had.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact numbers.

Let me compute 4/7 ≈ 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714 is approximately? Let's think.

0.5714 is about 0.571. Let's compute 0.8^3: 0.512. 0.82^3: 0.82 *0.82=0.6724, *0.82≈0.551. 0.83^3: 0.83^2=0.6889, *0.83≈0.571. Oh, exactly! Because 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571. So the cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83.

So (4/7)^(1/3) is approximately 0.83. So the ratio is 0.83, which is option C.

So the answer should be option C, ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital radius. The equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius \( a \), i.e., \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), the orbital radius \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \).

For Planet 2 and Planet 4, their orbital periods are \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). Thus, their orbital radii are proportional to:

\[
a_2 \propto (2P_1)^{2/3}, \quad a_4 \propto (3.5P_1)^{2/3}.
\]

The ratio of their orbital radii is:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{2}{3.5} \), we get \( \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \). Substituting this into the ratio:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

To compute \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \), note that \( 4/7 \approx 0.5714 \). The cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately \( 0.83 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
