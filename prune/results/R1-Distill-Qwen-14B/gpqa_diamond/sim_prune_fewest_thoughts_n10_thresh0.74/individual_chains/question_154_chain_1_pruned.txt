Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures. 

Hmm, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and another at 158 with 32%. Wait, so the molecular ion is 156, but there's a peak at 158 which is about a third of the intensity. That might indicate something like a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has a common isotope at about 35Cl (~75%) and 37Cl (~25%). So if the molecular formula has one Cl, the molecular ion would have peaks at m/z = (156) and (156+2)=158. The intensity ratio would be about 3:1, since 75% to 25% is 3:1. But wait, in the data, the m/z 158 is at 32%, which is roughly a third of 100%. So that would fit with a 3:1 ratio. So that suggests the molecule has a Cl atom.

Next, the IR data. Broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. I know that a broad peak in that region usually suggests OH groups, like in alcohols or phenols. But wait, wait. Another possibility is an N-H stretch, but the options don't seem to have amines. So probably an OH. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl group. 1720 is in the range for a carbonyl, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H stretch around 3000 and a strong carbonyl around 1700. But in this case, the IR shows a broad peak from 3500 down, which could be an O-H from a carboxylic acid, especially considering the 1720 peak.

But wait, the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). So a singlet at 11 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, no, aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm, maybe up to 10.5. But 11 is a bit higher, but possible. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton would be around 10-12 ppm, as a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, maybe a deprotonated carboxylic acid? Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid in solution, it would be in the free form, but maybe in DMSO or another solvent, it might show as a sharp peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with Cl on position 3 and OH on position 2. So the aldehyde proton should be around 9-10 ppm, but here it's at 11. Also, the OH would be on the ring, but in NMR, it would be broad, but in the data, the 11 ppm is a singlet. Wait, in this case, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet as well. Maybe if it's an aldehyde, the 11 ppm is correct. But the OH in this case would be a phenolic OH, which is usually broad, but in the IR, the broad peak could be the OH. But the 1H NMR doesn't show a broad peak, only a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's not a phenolic OH but an aldehyde. Wait, but the aldehyde would be a singlet, but the OH would be elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl on the benzene ring at position 4, and a COOH group. So the COOH would have a proton around 11 ppm as a singlet (if the solution is acidic, maybe it's exchanged and not appearing, but in some cases, like if the solution is not strongly acidic, it could show up as a peak).
