Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. From what I learned, the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition where a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

The problem has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. Each part has reactants and conditions, and we need to determine the major products. Then, we have to choose the correct option (A to D) that gives the right products for each.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

**Part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ A**

Hmm, I think dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a diethyl malonate derivative, which is a known enolate precursor. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, in an E configuration. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon (but wait, no, wait: methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. Because acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-R. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. Wait, no, wait: I'm a bit confused. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-p-tolyl-CO-OCH3. No, wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the COOCH3 is on carbon 3, so the p-tolyl is on carbon 2? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3? No, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-CH3? No, that's not right either. Maybe the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOCH3. Wait, that would make the double bond between CH2 and C, which has a p-tolyl group attached. So the structure is CH2
