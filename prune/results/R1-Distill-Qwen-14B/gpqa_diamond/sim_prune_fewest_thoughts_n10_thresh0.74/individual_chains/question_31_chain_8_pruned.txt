Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, so I'll think through each step carefully. Let's see...

The question involves a series of reactions starting with toluene. I'll need to figure out what each product is and then determine the molecular symmetry group of the final product, product 3.

First, toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). I remember that nitration typically happens under these conditions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, and nitration adds a nitro group. The nitro group is a strong meta-directing substituent. So, the nitration of toluene would add the nitro group in the meta position relative to the methyl group. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, toluene is methylbenzene. The nitration would occur at the para position because the methyl is an activating group and directs incoming electrophiles to the para and ortho positions. Oh wait, no, nitric acid is a strong nitronium source, and in nitration, the methyl is an activating group, so the nitro group would enter either para or ortho positions. But usually, the major product is para nitrotoluene because of the activating effect and steric hindrance, but sometimes ortho can be a minor product. However, for the sake of this problem, I think the nitration would form m-nitrotoluene? Or wait, no, no. Wait, the methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So nitration would add nitro groups primarily at the para position and ortho as minor. So product 1 would be para-nitrotoluene.

Wait, no, wait. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. When you nitrate it, the nitro group is meta to the methyl. Wait, no, no. Wait, the methyl is an ortho/para director, so the nitration occurs at the ortho, para positions relative to the methyl. So product 1 is either para-nitrotoluene or ortho. Since the para position is more favored, the main product is para-nitrotoluene. So product 1 is 4-nitro toluene, which is para nitrotoluene.

Next step: product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. In acidic conditions, Mn
