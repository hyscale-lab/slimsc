Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN- ions, and the stability constants for four different complexes.

So, let's jot down what we know. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase as the complex becomes more stable, right? So higher β means more stable complex.

But wait, wait. The problem is about the dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached to the Co(II) ion. So the complex in question is [Co(SCN)_2]^n+.

Wait, but how are the complexes ordered? Because the stability constants are given as β1 to β4. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on. So what's each β corresponding to?

I think the stability constants are for the stepwise formation of the complex. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, β3 for Co(SCN)_3, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4. So each β is the constant for adding one more SCN- to the complex.

So the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of the β's up to that point. For example, the formation constant K1 would be β1 for [CoSCN]^+, K2 would be β1*β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, K3 is β1β2β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, and K4 is β1β2β3β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-} or something like that.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the charge. Let me think. Co is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So [Co(SCN)] would be +1
