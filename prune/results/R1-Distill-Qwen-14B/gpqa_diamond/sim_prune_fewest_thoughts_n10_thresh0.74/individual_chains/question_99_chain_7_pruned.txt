Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown organic compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question provides four possible structures, and I need to pick the correct one based on the spectroscopic data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, I remember that a very broad peak in the 3000 region could also be due to N-H or maybe even C-H stretching, but O-H is more common. So I'm thinking maybe a carboxylic acid group is present because they have strong and broad O-H stretches. The other peak mentioned is a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which makes sense for a carboxylic acid as well because they have a carbonyl group. Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone, but since the broad peak suggests -OH, a carboxylic acid is more likely.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds (or at least no vinylic protons), which means the structure doesn't have any CH₂=CH groups. So any structure with a double bond would be out, but looking at the options, all the compounds given don't have double bonds. So that's not an issue here.

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. Splitting comes from neighboring protons. Each time a proton has adjacent Hs, it splits into a multiplet.

A quartet means four peaks, so a proton next to a CH₂ group. A triplet would be next to a CH group with two Hs. So maybe each of these signals is coming from a complex environment, perhaps vicinal coupling (like neighboring CH₂ groups) or maybe from geminal (same carbon) protons, but geminal coupling is usually not observed because the protons are
