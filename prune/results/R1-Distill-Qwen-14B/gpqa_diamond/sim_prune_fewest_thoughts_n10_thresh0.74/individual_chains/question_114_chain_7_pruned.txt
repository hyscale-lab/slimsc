Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for the reactions given. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones through the cyanide addition. But wait, how does that happen again? Oh right, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon.

But wait, the product here is a nitrile. So maybe it's a case of the ketone reacting with cyanide in some specific conditions. But I think when a ketone like butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. Oh right! A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with a cyanide nucleophile. But then, what's the role of reagent A here?

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me visualize that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the cyanide added to the carbonyl, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group. That fits the cyanohydrin formation.

Now, for the reaction conditions to form a cyanohydrin, I think you usually use an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the formation
