Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think about what I remember.

Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that parallax (plx) in parsecs is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/distance, meaning closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution—does that mean the same number of stars per unit volume in space? So, if we imagine the universe as a 3D space filled with stars uniformly, the number density is constant.

Now, the problem asks about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Parallax is a measure of distance, so as parallax increases, the stars are closer to us. We need to find how the number of stars in a small range of plx (say, from plx to plx + dplx) depends on plx.

So, let's model this. Let's think in terms of distance. Since plx = 1/d (where d is distance in parsecs), then d = 1/plx. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would depend on the volume of that shell.

The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dr. But since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell is proportional to the volume. So, N ∝ 4πd² dr.

But since we're looking for the number per unit plx, we need to express this in terms of plx. Let's change variables from d to plx. Since d = 1/plx, dr/dplx = d(1/plx)/dplx. Let's compute that.

d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Since we're dealing with absolute values for the range, the negative sign can be ignored. So, dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

Substituting back into N:

N ∝ 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * (1/plx²) dplx)

Let me calculate that:

(1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) = 1/plx^4. So,

N ∝ 4π * (1/plx
