Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom transitions. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the decay of the 3,0,0 state to the 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

So, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for dipole transitions. I think the main ones are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Because dipole transitions involve a change in the angular momentum, right?

Wait, so the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. The path has two steps, each a dipole transition. So first it goes from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state, and then from there to 1,0,0.

Let me think about the possible intermediate states. The initial l is 0 (s orbital), so for the first transition, Δl can be ±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1. Because Δl can't be -1 in this case since l=0 is the lowest.

So the first transition must be to a state with l=1. So the intermediate state will have l=1. Now, what about the m values? The initial m is 0. So for the first transition, m can change by 0, ±1. So possible m values after first transition are -1, 0, +1.

So possible intermediates are |2,1, m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1? Wait wait, but wait. The principle quantum number n has to be such that the transition is allowed. The initial state is n=3. So the next state must have n=3 ±1 = 2 or 4. But since the final state is n=1, the second transition must take n=2 to 1 because 4 would go too far. So the intermediate state must have n=2, l=1, and m could be -1, 0, +1.

So the possible intermediates are |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩.

Now, from each of these intermediates, can they transition to |1,0,0⟩? Let's check the selection rules again.

For the second transition, from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩.

The initial state of this transition is the intermediate, which is |2,1,m⟩, and the final state is |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, n goes from 2 to 1, which is Δn = -1, which is allowed because dipole transitions allow Δn = ±1. So that's fine.

Now for the l values: initial l is 1, final l is 0. So Δl = -1, which is allowed because the selection rule is Δl = ±1. So that's okay.

The m transition: from m_initial to m_final = 0. So the change in m should be 0, ±1. So m_initial can be -
