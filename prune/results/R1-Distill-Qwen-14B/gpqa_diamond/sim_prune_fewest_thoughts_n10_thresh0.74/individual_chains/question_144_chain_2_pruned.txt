Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I need to find the mean decay distance. Let me think about what I remember from my classes.

So, the question gives me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. I remember that the decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh wait, and the mean decay length formula is something like L = v * τ, where τ is the lifetime.

Right, so first I need to find the lifetime τ. I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ, and the uncertainty in time Δt is τ. So Γ ≈ ħ / τ, which gives τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Wait, but wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Let me get the value right. ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s, right?

Wait, but the units here are in GeV for energy. So I should convert everything to consistent units. Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Calculate that: 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, let me do that calculation again. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s. That's the lifetime.

Now, I need to
