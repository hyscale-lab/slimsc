Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, elastic scattering... right, that's when the incident particles (in this case electrons) collide with target particles (nuclei) and change direction but without any loss of energy. The phase shifts are given here: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest are ignored, so I guess we only consider these five phase shifts.

The scattering amplitude's imaginary part... I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) has both real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part relates to the absorption or the phase shifts in the scattering process. Oh right, the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the direction of the incident beam (θ=0°) is given by something involving the phase shifts.

Wait, when θ is zero, the momentum transfer is along the beam. So I think the formula is Im f(0) = (k/(2m)) * [1 + 2Σ (sinδ_l) ] where the sum is over the phase shifts for each l (the orbital angular momentum quantum number). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh right, for each partial wave l, the contribution comes from sin δ_l multiplied by something else.

Wait, the general formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) / (2ik) ) * [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] * P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But when θ is 0, cosθ is 1, so P_l(cos 0) is P_l(1) which is 1 for l=0 and 0 for l>0. So for θ=0, only the l=0 term contributes.

So Im f(0) is the imaginary part of the l=0 term. So let's compute that.

The l=0 term is (2*0 +1)/(2ik) [e^{2iδ_0} -1 ] * P_0(1). P_0(1) is 1, so it's (1)/(2ik) [e^{2iδ_0} -1 ].

So the imaginary part of this term would be Im [ (1/(2ik)) (e^{2iδ_0} -1) ].

Wait, since (1/(2ik)) is a complex number. Let me write it as (1/(2ik)) = (i/(2k)) * (1/i^2) )? Wait, no, 1/k is real, so 1/(2ik) = 1/(2
