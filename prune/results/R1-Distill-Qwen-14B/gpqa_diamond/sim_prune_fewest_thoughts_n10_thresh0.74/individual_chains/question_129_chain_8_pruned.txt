Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question involves a series of reactions leading from compound A to E. I need to identify what compound E is, given the reaction steps and some hints. Let's break it down.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd catalyst to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints provided. Let's look at hint a) and b).

Hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting aldehydes or ketones with ylides. So, compound A must be an aldehyde or ketone because it reacts with a ylide to form an alkene.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure. So cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group. Wait, the substituent is a propenylidene group attached at the 4 position.

Wait, the structure is a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. Then at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the structure would be cyclopentane with a double bond connected to that group.

But I'm a bit confused about how the Wittig reaction works here. So compound A is reacting with a ylide to form an alkene. So compound A must be an aldehyde or ketone. Let's think about that.

If the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, that suggests that the ylide added to a carbonyl group in compound A to form the double bond. So, where is the carbonyl in A?

Assuming that the carbonyl is in the cyclopentane ring. For example, if compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let's say it's 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Because, after the Wittig reaction, the carbonyl would be replaced by a CH2- group attached to the ylide's group.

Wait, let me think again. In a Wittig reaction, R2P=CH- group attacks the carbonyl carbon. So the structure would form a double bond between the former carb
