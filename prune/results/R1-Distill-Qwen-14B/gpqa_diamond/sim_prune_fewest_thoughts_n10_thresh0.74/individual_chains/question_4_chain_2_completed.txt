Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations... Right, there are four of them. Let me think about each one. The first equation is about the divergence of the electric field, Gauss's law for electricity. I think that deals with charge distribution. So if the magnet can have isolated poles, does that equation change? Probably not, because Gauss's law is about electric fields and charges, not magnetic monopoles.

The second equation is Gauss's law for magnetism. Oh right, in our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero because there are no isolated magnetic charges. So the equation is ∇·B = 0. But if in this universe, there are isolated North and South poles (like magnetic monopoles), then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. So that equation would change. So the second equation is definitely different.

What about Faraday's law, the third equation? It's about the curl of the electric field. Faraday's law in our universe is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. Does the existence of magnetic monopoles affect this? I'm not so sure. Wait, if there are magnetic charges, then Maxwell's equations might need to include them. Let me think. The original Maxwell's equations don't have magnetic charges. But if they did, how would that change things?

Oh wait, if magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. So the second equation would change from ∇·B = 0 to something else, maybe ∇·B = rho_m, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density.

Then, what about Ampère's law, the fourth equation? Ampère's law in our universe is ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. But if there are magnetic charges, would there be a term involving them here? Or in another equation?

Wait, I remember that when magnetic monopoles are introduced, the symmetry between electric and magnetic fields is enhanced. So both Gauss's and Ampère's laws would get modified. Or maybe Faraday's and Ampère's.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Maxwell equations with magnetic monopoles would have all four equations changed in a symmetric way. So in our universe without monopoles, the equations are:

1. ∇·E = rho/epsilon0
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

But with monopoles, the equations would be:

1. Same as before, since electric charge is still there.
2. ∇·B = rho_m (where rho_m is magnetic charge density)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (where J_m is magnetic current?) I'm not sure.
Wait, maybe not. Another approach: When introducing magnetic monopoles, two of Maxwell's equations get modified. The ones that describe the divergence of B and the curl of E.

Wait, in the standard treatment, the modified Maxwell equations with magnetic monopoles are:

∇·B = μ0 rho_m (or something like that)
∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m

So Ampère's law and Faraday's law would both change. Because Ampère's law would have a term for the magnetic current, and Faraday's law would have a term for the magnetic charge.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's law: Electric flux depends on electric charge.
2. Gauss's law for magnetism: In our case, divergence of B is zero, but with monopoles, it's non-zero.
3. Faraday's law: Curl of E is negative time derivative of B.
4. Ampère's law: Curl of H is current plus time derivative of D.

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the second equation changes (div B != 0). Also, the third equation (Faraday's law) would get an additional term because of the magnetic current.

Wait, I think that's right. So the third equation, which is the curl of E, would have a term involving the magnetic current. Similarly, the fourth equation would have a term for the electric current and maybe something else.

Wait, no, Ampère's law with Maxwell's correction already includes the displacement current. So when magnetic monopoles are added, I think the equations change in two places: the divergence of B, and the curl of E.

So in the question, the scenario is that magnets can have isolated North or South poles. So the divergence of B equation (second Maxwell equation) would change. And the curl of E (third equation) would also change, because Faraday's law would have a term for the time derivative of B and also the magnetic current.

Wait, but the options given are about which equations are different. Let me look at the options.

Options:
A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So that would be equation 2.
B) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So equations 3 and 2.
C) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. Hmm, not sure about that.
D) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equations 2 and 4? Wait, equation 4 is the curl of H.

Wait, no. The fourth equation is Ampère's law, which is curl H = J + ∂D/∂t. I'm not sure if the curl of H would change with magnetic monopoles. But I think that the presence of magnetic monopoles would modify Ampère's law as well, because the equation would have to account for magnetic current.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Without magnetic monopoles, the equations are:

1. ∇·E = rho / epsilon0
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

With magnetic monopoles, the equations become:

1. Same as before.
2. ∇·B = rho_m (some constant factor)
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m (assuming J_m is the magnetic current)
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t + something? Or maybe not. Hmm, maybe Ampère's law remains the same but another equation changes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the introduction of magnetic monopoles modifies both the second and third equations. So, the second equation (div B) is not zero, and the third equation (curl E) has an additional term.

So which equations are different? Both equation 2 and equation 3. Wait, but the options don't have an option that includes both divergence of B and curl of E.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field (which would be equation 3) and the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2). So option B is that both equations 2 and 3 are different.

Option D says the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equation 2 (div B) and equation 4 (curl H?), but I'm not sure if equation 4 changes.

Wait, equation 4 is about the curl of H. Do magnetic monopoles affect the curl of H? Let me think. Ampère's law with Maxwell's correction is about the curl of H. If there's a magnetic current, perhaps there would be an additional term in Ampère's law.

But wait, in the standard treatment, when magnetic monopoles are present, the equations are modified in two places. Let me look up the modified Maxwell equations with magnetic monopoles.

Wait, I can't look things up, but from memory, the modified equations are:

1. ∇·E = rho_e / ε₀ (unchanged)
2. ∇·B = rho_m μ₀ (so equation 2 changes)
3. ∇×E = - ( ∂B/∂t + J_m μ₀ ) (so equation 3 changes)
4. ∇×H = J_e + ε₀ ∂E/∂t + J_m / c² (not exactly sure, but Ampère's law would have an additional term for the magnetic current?)

Wait, or perhaps equation 4 would incorporate the magnetic current. Alternatively, maybe equation 3 gets a term involving the magnetic current, and equation 4 remains the same except for the displacement current.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 would change by the addition of a term involving the magnetic current density.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the symmetries. Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles are symmetric between electric and magnetic fields. So equation 2 and equation 3 would both have sources.

So equation 2 would have a divergence term for B (magnetic charge), and equation 3 would have a term for the time derivative of B and also a magnetic current.

So in that case, both equations 2 and 3 would change.

Looking back at the options, option B is: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equations 3 and 2. So option B would be correct.

Wait, but why would equation 3 change? Because without magnetic monopoles, equation 3 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there's a magnetic current, then Faraday's law would have an additional term. So ∇×E would also include a term related to the magnetic current.

So in this scenario, both equations 2 and 3 are different.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says those two equations, so that's the correct one.

Other options: option D is about the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equation 2 (div B) and equation 4 (curl H) perhaps? Not sure. But I think equation 4 doesn't change with the presence of magnetic monopoles. Or does it?

Wait, equation 4 is Ampère's law: ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. If magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps Ampère's law would have an additional term. Let me think. Suppose you have a magnetic current, similar to how we have electric current. Then, perhaps Ampère's law would have a term for the magnetic current, but I'm not sure how that would fit in.

Alternatively, maybe Ampère's law would have a term like J_m (magnetic current) in it. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. But I think that the main changes are in the divergence of B and the curl of E. So equations 2 and 3.

So the correct answer would be option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.


In a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles (magnetic monopoles), Maxwell's equations are modified to account for the existence of magnetic charge and current. In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero because magnetic monopoles do not exist. However, in this hypothetical scenario, ∇·B would no longer be zero; instead, it would depend on the magnetic charge density (ρ_m). This changes the second equation of Maxwell's set.

Additionally, Faraday's law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t) would also change. In our universe, this equation describes how the electric field circulates in response to a time-varying magnetic field. With magnetic monopoles, an additional term involving the magnetic current density (J_m) would appear, making the third equation different as well.

The other equations—Gauss's law for electricity (∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀) and Ampère's law (∇×H = J_e + ∂D/∂t)—remain largely unchanged because they pertain to electric charge and current, which are unaffected by the presence of magnetic monopoles.

Thus, the two equations that are different in this scenario are the ones related to the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2) and the circulation of the electric field (equation 3).
