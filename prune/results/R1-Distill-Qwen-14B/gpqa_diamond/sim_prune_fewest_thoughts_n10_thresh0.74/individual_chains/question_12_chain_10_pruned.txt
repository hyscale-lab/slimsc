Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is at rest, and I'm given the rest masses: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². Hmm, I think the neutrino is considered massless or at least negligible in mass compared to the other particles here.

So the pion is at rest, which means the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That's an important point.

I remember that in particle decays, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta, leading to some kinetic energy for each.

The problem asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles. The options give pairs of numbers, so I need to find the kinetic energy for both the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. In many cases, when dealing with neutrinos, we can approximate them as massless. So I think that here, the neutrino's rest mass can be neglected, making its energy purely kinetic. Or maybe, since it's a product, the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy plus any rest mass energy, but if its mass is zero, then all its energy is kinetic.

Wait, but the pion is at rest, so the muon and neutrino must share the energy and momentum in such a way that their momenta sum to zero.

Let me think about the energy and momentum conservation.

The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so I'll assume it's zero for this calculation.

So the initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy will be its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is zero).

So E_final = E_muon + E_neutrino = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

But energy is conserved, so E_initial = E_final. So,

139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

That's one equation.

Now, for momentum conservation. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the final momentum must also sum to zero. So the muon's momentum and the neutrino's momentum must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

The momentum of the muon is given by p_mu = gamma * m_mu * v, but that might be tricky. Alternatively, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So for the muon: E_muon² = (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)².

And for the neutrino: since m_nu ≈ 0, E_nu² = (p_nu c)².

But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), let's denote p as the magnitude of each momentum. So,

E_muon² = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2,

E_nu² = (p c)^2.

But since E_muon = m_mu c² + K_mu, and E_nu = K_nu.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe I can set up the equations.

We have two equations:

1) 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

2) From momentum conservation: p_mu = p_nu = p.

So,

E_muon² = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2,

E_nu² = (p c)^2.

But E_muon = 105.7 + K_mu,

E_nu = K_nu.

So,

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2,

(K_nu)^2 = (p c)^2.

Substituting the second into the first,

(
