Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Wait, identical particles mean they must obey either Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac statistics. Spin-1/2 particles are fermions, right? So they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two can occupy the same quantum state in the same system. 

The system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is what the problem states as E = pi² hbar²/(2mL²) multiplied by n squared. Oh wait, the E given is for n=1, so E_1 = E. So E_n is n²E.

Now, the task is to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four fermions. Since they are fermions, each must have a unique quantum state. Each state is determined by quantum numbers n and spin. But wait, in a 1D box, the quantum number is n, and for spin-1/2, each n can have two possible spin states: up and down. So for each energy level n, there are two possible particles that can occupy it because of the spin.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the particles are identical and fermions, so for each spatial state (n), you can have two particles with opposite spins. So each n can hold 2 particles.

So with four particles, how are they filled?

In the ground state, you'd fill the lowest energy levels first, each accommodating as many particles as possible. So let's think about the filling order.

Each energy level n can hold 2 particles.

So let's see:

n=1: can hold 2 particles.

n=2: can hold another 2 particles.

Wait, but we have four particles. So n=1 takes 2, n=2 takes 2. So the ground state would have all four particles filled up to n=2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total particles is 4. So n=1 can take 2, n=2 can take 2, but 2+2=4. So all four are filled in the first two energy levels.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 (with spins up and down) and two in n=2 (same thing).

But wait, are n=1 and n=2 each with two particles each? Or is it that each n can have 2 particles regardless of spin.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the spatial wavefunction. For fermions, the total wavefunction is antisymmetric. But in the case of non-interacting particles in a box, the spatial wavefunction is symmetric or antisymmetric depending on the spin state.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. For non-interacting fermions, the ground state is filled with the lowest possible energy levels, each with 2 particles (spin up and down). So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles (each with spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (same)
n=3: 0
n=4: 0

Wait, but wait, four particles, so n=1 and n=2 each have two. So the ground state energy would be sum of the energies of each occupied state.

Wait, but how do you calculate the total energy for the system? Each particle's energy is E_n, so the total is the sum of each particle's energy.

So for the ground state:

Each of the two particles in n=1 contributes E_1, and the two in n=2 contribute E_2.

So total energy E_ground = 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, E_1 is E, E_2 is (2²)E=4E.

So 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. No, no, wait the system's energy is the sum of the energies of all particles. So for each state, what is the total energy.

Wait, but the question is phrased as 'energies' of the system's states, which probably refers to the total energy of each state.

But let me think again. For the ground state, all four particles are in the lowest possible energy levels. So two in n=1, two in n=2.

So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So ground state is 10E.

Now, what about the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next possible arrangement when one of the particles is promoted to the next available energy level.

Wait, but for fermions, how does the state get excited? Once the ground state is filled, the next state would be where the highest particle is promoted to the next available level.

Wait, but since all four are filled, perhaps the first excited state involves moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, no because n=2 is already filled with two particles. So the next possible state would have one particle in n=3, but wait, how?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about how the states are filled.

In the ground state, all the lowest possible levels are filled: n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles).

The first excited state would be when one of the particles is promoted to the next available level. But since n=3 is the next level, and it can take up to two particles, so we can add one there. But how does that work when we have four particles?

Wait, but let me check: in the ground state, all four are in n=1 and n=2. To get the first excited state, perhaps one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but no, because n=2 is filled. So you can't have a particle promoted from n=2 to a higher n. Because the system is in the lowest state. So maybe the first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3, but since n=2 is already filled, the next possible would have the first particle in n=3 and the rest as in the ground state.

Wait, but that would mean three particles in n=1 and two in n=2? No, no, because each n can have two particles max.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the highest occupied level has a particle promoted to the next possible state.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's energy levels are considered as the sum of all particles, so the next possible state after the ground state is when you have three particles in lower levels and one in a higher level.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible states in order of increasing energy.

The ground state has four particles in the lowest two levels: n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). The total energy is 10E.

The first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So now, in n=3, there's one particle, but wait, no, each n can hold two particles. So perhaps in the first excited state, we have two particles in n=1, two in n=2, and zero in n=3. That's the same as the ground state. No, that can't be. So perhaps the system can't have a higher energy than the ground state without having particles in higher n. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but since we have four particles, perhaps the first excited state has three particles in n=1, one in n=2, and zero in n=3? No, that can't be because n=2 can take two. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the particles are arranged in the lowest energy states in a way that every possible state is filled in order. So for four particles, the ground state would have the two lowest n's filled: n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

The next possible state would have one particle promoted to n=3, but since each n can take two particles, the first excited state would have two in n=1, two in n=2, and zero in n=3. That's the same as ground state. So perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state would be when the number of particles in higher n increases. Wait, maybe I should think about the possible configurations.

Wait, for four particles, the possible configurations (n) are:

1. All four in the lowest possible n's: n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy 2E + 2*(4E) = 10E.

2. One particle in n=3. But wait, since n=3 can take two, perhaps in the first excited state, we have two in n=3. But wait, is that possible?

Wait, no, because if all four particles can't be in n=1 and n=2, perhaps the next state would have one particle in n=3. But how does that work.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would be when one particle is in n=3, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. But let me calculate the energies.

Wait, let's think about the possible states:

Ground state: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. Total energy 10E.

First excited state: perhaps the highest possible state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but since each n can have two, perhaps the first excited state has two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Wait, but no, because n=2 can have two. So perhaps it's better to think of it as the next possible configuration after all n=1 and n=2 are filled.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when all four particles are in n=1 and n=2, but arranged differently. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when the highest particle is promoted to the next available level, which is n=3. So perhaps one particle in n=3, and the rest as in the ground state. But let's see:

In that case, the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (2), and n=3 (0). Wait, that's same as the ground state. So perhaps the first excited state isn't changing that.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible states in terms of the number of particles in each level.

For four particles, we can have the following possible distributions:

1. (2,2,0,0,...) → n=1 (2), n=2 (2), others zero.

2. (2,1,1,0,...) → n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1).

3. (2,0,2,0,...) → n=1 (2), n=3 (2).

4. (1,1,1,1, ...) → n=1(1),n=2(1),n=3(1),n=4(1).

Wait, but for fermions, each level can hold up to two particles. So the first state is (2,2) with total energy 2E + 2*(4E)=10E.

The next possible state would be (2,1,1) → n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1. But wait, can n=2 have only one particle? Since each level can take up to two, yes. So the configuration would be (2,1,1), but wait, that's three levels, but we have four particles. Wait, 2+1+1=4, yes.

But wait, would moving particles to higher n's give a higher energy. So the first excited state would be when one of the particles is promoted to n=3. So the total energy would be 2E (from n=1) + 1*(4E) (n=2) + 1*(9E) (n=3) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but wait, in the ground state, n=2 has two particles, each contributing 4E, so 2 * 4E =8E. In this new state, n=2 has one, so 4E, and n=3 has one, 9E, plus n=1's 2E. So total is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

So that's the first excited state—energy 15E.

Then the second excited state would be another promotion. Let's see. What's the next possible configuration.

Possibly (2,0,2,0) → n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the energy is 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E=20E.

But wait, another possibility is (1,2,1,0), which would be n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1). So the energy would be 1E + 2*(4E) + 1*(9E) = E +8E +9E=18E.

Wait, so which has higher energy: 20E or 18E? 20E is higher. So the order of energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), then either 18E or 20E.

Wait, so which arrangement comes next in energy.

Wait, let's list possible states and their energies:

- (2,2,0,0, ...) → 10E
- (2,1,1,0, ...) → 15E
- (1,2,1,0, ...) → 18E
- (2,0,2,0, ...) → 20E
- (1,1,1,1, ...) → 1+4+9+16=30E

So the energies in order would be 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, 30E.

Wait, the question is asking for the ground state, first excited, and second excited states. So the first excited is 15E, the second would be 18E.

Wait, no. Because after 10E, the next lowest is 15E, then 18E, then 20E, etc.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 10,15,18. Option C is 4,10,15, but that doesn't fit because the ground state is 10E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second is 18E.

Wait, but wait, in the configuration (1,2,1,0), which gives 1E + 2*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 1+8+9=18E. So that's a valid state.

Alternatively, the configuration (2,1,1) gives 2E (n=1) + 1*4E (n=2) + 1*9E (n=3) = 2+4+9=15E.

So the order is 10E, then 15E, then 18E.

So the options are:

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Which would be the ground state (10E), first excited (15E), second excited (18E).

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the ground state would be 10E, which matches option D.

So the energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). So the correct answer would have those three numbers. Looking at the options:

Option D: 10E,15E,18E → that's the one.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in the Infinite Well**:  
   The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E \quad \text{(where \(E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}\))}.
   \]  
   For \(n = 1, 2, 3, \dots\), the energy levels are \(E_1 = E\), \(E_2 = 4E\), \(E_3 = 9E\), \(E_4 = 16E\), etc.

2. **Fermionic Nature and Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each quantum level \(n\) can hold up to 2 particles (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the lowest energy levels are filled first. For four particles:  
   - 2 particles occupy \(n = 1\) (energy \(E_1 = E\)),  
   - 2 particles occupy \(n = 2\) (energy \(E_2 = 4E\)).  
   Total energy of the ground state:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2(4E) = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \(n = 2\) to \(n = 3\). The configuration becomes:  
   - 2 particles occupy \(n = 1\) (energy \(E_1 = E\)),  
   - 1 particle occupies \(n = 2\) (energy \(E_2 = 4E\)),  
   - 1 particle occupies \(n = 3\) (energy \(E_3 = 9E\)).  
   Total energy of the first excited state:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted to \(n = 3\). The configuration becomes:  
   - 2 particles occupy \(n = 1\) (energy \(E_1 = E\)),  
   - 0 particles occupy \(n = 2\),  
   - 2 particles occupy \(n = 3\) (energy \(E_3 = 9E\)).  
   Total energy of the second excited state:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2E + 2(9E) = 20E.
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \(30E, 39E, 50E\) — Incorrect, as these values are too high.  
   - **Option B**: \(4E, 10E, 50E\) — Incorrect, as the ground state energy is \(10E\), not \(4E\).  
   - **Option C**: \(4E, 10E, 15E\) — Incorrect, as the second excited state energy is \(20E\), not \(15E\).  
   - **Option D**: \(10E, 15E, 18E\) — Correct, as it matches the calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

### Final Answer:
The ground state energy is \(10E\), the first excited state energy is \(15E\), and the second excited state energy is \(18E\).  

Answer: D
