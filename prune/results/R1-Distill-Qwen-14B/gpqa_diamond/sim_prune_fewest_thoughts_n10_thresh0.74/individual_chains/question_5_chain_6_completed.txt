Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's break it down. The operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the components of P are given. P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0 1) and second row (1 0). Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix with (0 -i) in the first row and (i 0) in the second. P_z is (ħ/2) times a diagonal matrix with (1, 0) and (0, -1). 

So, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. But the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Wait, because in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or π, so θ would define the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the operator for the component along n would be P·n. So the operator is P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z, since n has zero y-component. Because n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator P·n is a combination of P_x and P_z.

But wait, the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P (along n) with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P·n and specifically for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the spin operator along an arbitrary direction. Because the operator P seems to represent the spin-1/2 operator. Because for spin-1/2 systems, the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2 give the components of the spin operator.

Wait, let's see. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when each is multiplied by ħ/2, they become the spin components for spin-1/2 systems. So P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, and P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the operator P·n would be (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

The eigenvalues of a spin-1/2 operator along any direction are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvectors correspond to spin-up and spin-down along direction n.

So the problem is to find the eigenvector (for eigenvalue +ħ/2) of the operator (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Let me denote the direction vector n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle between n and the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, θ would be measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator becomes (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

Wait, but for finding eigenvectors, maybe it's better to ignore the (ħ/2) factor since we can factor it out. Let's write the matrix.

The matrix for the operator is (ħ/2) times [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σ_z is diagonal [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So adding them with coefficients sinθ and cosθ, respectively:

sinθ * σ_x = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ * σ_z = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding them together: [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the operator is (ħ/2) * this matrix.

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for eigenvalue +1 (since (ħ/2) * eigenvalue would be the eigenvalue of P·n. Wait, the eigenvalues of (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) are ±1 because σ matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So multiplying by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So for eigenvalue +ħ/2, we have the eigenvalue equation:

( (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] ) * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2), so we have:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * |v> = |v>

So the eigenvalue equation simplifies to the matrix multiplied by the vector equals the vector. So the matrix is M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. The eigenvalue is 1.

So to find the eigenvector, we solve (M - I) v = 0.

M - I = [[cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ - 1]]

So the equations are:

(cosθ - 1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

Let me write the first equation:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 --> equation (1)

The second equation:

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0 --> equation (2)

We can solve these two equations for v1 and v2.

From equation (1): (cosθ - 1) v1 = - sinθ v2 --> v1 = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] v2

Similarly, equation (2): sinθ v1 = (cosθ +1) v2 --> v1 = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] v2

Wait, but I have two expressions for v1 in terms of v2. So equate them.

From equation (1): v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2 [since (cosθ -1) is -(1 - cosθ) ]

From equation (2): v1 = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] v2

So [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ]

Multiply both sides by (1 - cosθ) sinθ:

sin²θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) )

But sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ, and (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) = 1 - cos²θ. So yes, equality holds. Which means the two equations are dependent, and we can use either to express v1 in terms of v2.

So let's pick one. Let me take v1 = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1 + cosθ, sinθ )

Wait, because v2 is a variable, let's set v2 = sinθ. Then v1 = (1 + cosθ).

Alternatively, let's see: if I set v2 = 1, then v1 = (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ.

But perhaps it's cleaner to express the eigenvector as (1 + cosθ, sinθ). To normalize it, we need to compute the norm.

The norm squared is (1 + cosθ)^2 + sin²θ. Let's expand that:

(1 + 2 cosθ + cos²θ) + sin²θ = 1 + 2 cosθ + (cos²θ + sin²θ) ) = 2 + 2 cosθ = 2(1 + cosθ).

So the norm is sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ (1 + cosθ), sinθ ] / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)).

Hmm, but I can factor out some terms. Let's write it as:

[ (1 + cosθ) / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) , sinθ / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) ]

Which simplifies to:

sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) , sinθ / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) )

Wait, sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) is equal to cos(theta/2) because of the double-angle formula: cos^2(theta/2) = (1 + cosθ)/2.

Similarly, sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ), but wait.

Wait, let me compute each component.

sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) * sqrt(2) ?

Wait, let me see:

The first component is sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) * sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) )^{-1/2} ?

Wait, maybe I should compute each component:

First component: (1 + cosθ) / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) ) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ) ) / sqrt(2) )

Because (1 + cosθ) = [sqrt(1 + cosθ)]^2. So (1 + cosθ) / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) ) = [sqrt(1 + cosθ)] * [ sqrt(1 + cosθ) ] / [ sqrt(2) sqrt(1 + cosθ) ) ] ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor the terms.

Wait, 2(1 + cosθ) can be written as 4 cos²(theta/2), because 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2). So 2(1 + cosθ) = 4 cos²(theta/2).

So sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) = sqrt(4 cos²(theta/2)) ) = 2 |cos(theta/2)|. Assuming theta is between 0 and pi, cos(theta/2) is positive, so it's 2 cos(theta/2).

So the first component is (1 + cosθ) / (2 cos(theta/2) )

But 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2), so this becomes (2 cos²(theta/2)) / (2 cos(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).

Similarly, the second component is sinθ / (2 cos(theta/2) )

But sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), so it becomes [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [2 cos(theta/2) ] ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait a second. The way I set v2, the components are [ (1 + cosθ), sinθ ] before normalization. After normalization, I get [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, another thing: the eigenvector is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the components are these multiplied by some factor, but in the options, option C just has those components.

But wait, the eigenvector is a vector, and it's normalized, so the answer should be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, let me check the other options. Option B is (cosθ, e^{iϕ} sinθ ), but that seems more like spherical coordinates, perhaps, but for a different context.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar terms, but I don't think hbar is part of the eigenvector components because eigenvectors are dimensionless (assuming the problem is written with ħ as a factor in the operator, but the eigenvectors are just coefficients).

Wait, but looking back, the operator P is given with each component multiplied by ħ/2, but the eigenvectors are just the spin-up states along direction n, which are unit vectors. So their components don't have ħ in them.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go through again.

The eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options:

Option C says exactly that: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the problem states that the operator is P. So is P defined as a vector operator? Because in the problem statement, P is a vector operator, so the eigenvector is for the operator P·n, which is a spin-1/2 operator along n.

Yes, so the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right),
\]
where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$, the operator becomes:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This simplifies to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0,
\]
\[
\sin\theta v_1 + (-\cos\theta - 1)v_2 = 0.
\]

From the first equation, we find:
\[
v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2.
\]
Using the trigonometric identity $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:
\[
v_1 = \cos(\theta/2) v_2.
\]

The eigenvector is then proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the norm:
\[
\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2)} = 1.
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))}.
\]

This corresponds to **Option C**.
