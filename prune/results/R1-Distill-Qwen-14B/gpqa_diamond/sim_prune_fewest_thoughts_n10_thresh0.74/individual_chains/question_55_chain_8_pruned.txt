Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's see, the compound is an organic one, and the options are some kind of propenyl or butenyl acetates. Hmm. I remember that NMR can give clues about the structure, especially the splitting patterns and the integration.

The NMR data given is: 7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), and 1.6 (3H, d). Let me think about each part.

First, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant of 16 Hz. That seems like a big coupling, which usually indicates a trans double bond or maybe a vinyl group. Because in trans alkenes, the coupling between the two protons can be around 16 Hz. So maybe this is a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen or something else.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets. Wait, no, it's a dq, which I think is doublet of quartets or maybe doublet of doublets. Hmm, but the exact splitting can tell me about the neighboring protons. Maybe this is a vinyl proton as well, but coupled to more than one proton.

The 2.1 ppm triplet is a singlet with 3H. That's probably the acetate group's methyl, like OAc. Because the acetate methyl is usually around 2.1 as a singlet because the three protons are equivalent and there's no splitting.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet with 3H. That's another methyl group. Since it's a doublet, it's attached to a CH2 group. Wait, but 3H as a doubletâ€”maybe it's a methyl adjacent to a CH, like in an isopropyl group or maybe a CH2 group. But wait, no, a doublet for a CH3 would imply it's next to a CH2 group. Wait, no, a CH3 group would be split by neighboring protons. If it's a doublet, that means the neighboring group has two protons (like a CH2). So maybe it's a CH2 connected to a CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is an acetate where the ester is attached to a propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, let me think about propenyl acetate. Propenyl would be CH2CHCH2. But wait, the substituents might be different. Let me think about the possibilities.

Let me list the possible structures:

Cis-propenyl acetate: CH2CH2C(O)OAc? No, wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2-OAc? No, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structures. Let's think about the options.

The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-butenyl acetate.

So, propenyl acetate would have an acetate group attached to a propenyl group. The propenyl group is CH2CHCH2, but actually, propenyl is CH2=
