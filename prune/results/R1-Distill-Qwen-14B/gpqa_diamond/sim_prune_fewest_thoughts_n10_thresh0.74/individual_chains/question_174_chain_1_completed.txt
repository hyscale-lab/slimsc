Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, each with a few MeV differences.

Wait, okay, so first, let's parse the given information.

Initial nucleus: rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV/c², but I might not need to use the actual value since everything is proportional.

After fission, two fragments: one is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the masses. Let me say m and 2m. But wait, the sum of their masses is 0.99 M. Because the sum is 99% of initial mass.

Wait, but the initial nucleus's mass is M, and after fission, the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. And m1 is twice m2? Or the other way around? Wait, the problem says one fragment is twice more massive than the other. So which is which? Let me read again.

"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other." So if one is twice the other, let's say m1 = 2 m2. Or the other way? Hmm, the wording says "2 times more massive than the other"—so if fragment A is twice as massive as fragment B, then m1 = 2 m2.

Wait wait, no. Let me think. If A is 2 times more massive than B, then A is 2B. So assuming m1 is the more massive, so m1 = 2 m2.

So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Also, m1 = 2 m2 → m2 = m1/2.

Substituting into the sum: m1 + (m1/2) = 0.99 M → (3/2) m1 = 0.99 M → m1 = (0.99 * 2/3) M → m1 = 0.66 M, and m2 = 0.33 M.

Wait that makes the sum 0.66 + 0.33 = 0.99 M. Yep, that's correct.

So the two fragments have rest masses of 0.66 M and 0.33 M. But wait, the initial mass was M, but their combined rest mass is 0.99 M. So there's some mass defect, which is 0.01 M. That would be converted into energy, which would be kinetic energy, I suppose.

But since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p1 = -p2. Since p = gamma m v, but since they're moving in opposite directions, their velocities are opposite.

Wait, but in the center-of-momentum frame, that's the case. But since the original nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total final momentum must also be zero. So, yes, the two fragments' momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So the momentum of fragment 1 (m1) is p, and fragment 2 (m2) is -p.

So the kinetic energy for each fragment would come from their respective gamma factors.

But this is a relativistic problem. So we can't just use classical KE = ½ m v². We'll need to use relativistic expressions.

But the question is about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation. So perhaps we can calculate T1 relativistically, find the kinetic energy, and then subtract the non-relativistic approximation of it.

Wait, but how do we approach this? Because we don't have velocities, but we can use conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The initial rest energy is Mc² = 300 GeV.

2. After fission, the rest energies of the fragments are m1 c² and m2 c², which sum to 0.99 Mc². So the total rest mass is 0.99 M, so the mass defect is 0.01 M. The energy released (Q) would then be (0.01 M c²) × c², but wait, no. Wait, the rest mass of the fragments is 0.99 M, so the total energy released is (M - 0.99 M) c² = 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV (since M=300 GeV/c² → (0.01 * 300) = 3 GeV).

Wait, but that's the total energy released as binding energy, which goes into kinetic energy of the fragments. So the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

But wait, no. In reality, the total energy of each fragment is their rest energy plus their kinetic energy. So the initial total energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2), which should equal the initial energy plus any other energies, but since it's an isolated system, initial energy is conserved. So:

m1 c² + m2 c² + K1 + K2 = M c².

But m1 + m2 = 0.99 M → m1 c² + m2 c² = 0.99 M c².

So 0.99 M c² + K1 + K2 = M c² → K1 + K2 = 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV.

So the sum of the two kinetic energies is 3 GeV.

Now, we need to find K1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1=0.66 M), and then find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the non-relativistic approximation.

So how do we find K1 and K2?

We have to use conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So:

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 = p
p2 = gamma2 m2 v2 = -p

So the magnitudes are |p1| = |p2| → gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since m1 = 2 m2 (as m1 is 2 times m2), then m1 = 2 m2.

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought m1 is 2 m2 because the fragment is twice more massive. So m1 = 2 m2.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses)". So if m1 is more massive, then m1 = 2 m2.

Wait, but earlier when I set m1 = 2 m2, I found m1 = 0.66 M and m2 = 0.33 M. So that's correct.

So m1 = 2 m2 → m2 = m1/2.

In terms of momentum:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But m2 = m1/2, so:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 (m1/2) v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Hmm. Also, the velocities might be in opposite directions, but their magnitudes affect the momentum.

Wait, but since momentum is a vector, I have p1 = +p, p2 = -p.

So, the magnitudes are |p1|=p, |p2|=p.

So:

gamma1 m1 v1 = p
gamma2 m2 v2 = p

Because p1 is positive and p2 is negative, but their magnitudes are the same.

Wait, but m1 is 2 m2, so substituting m2 as m1/2:

gamma1 m1 v1 = p → equation 1.

gamma2 (m1/2) v2 = p → equation 2.

So dividing equation 1 by equation 2:

(gamma1 m1 v1) / (gamma2 (m1/2) v2 ) ) = 1 → (2 gamma1 v1) / (gamma2 v2) ) = 1 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to write v1 in terms of v2. Alternatively, perhaps we can relate v1 and v2 via their gamma factors.

Alternatively, since the kinetic energies are involved, perhaps we can express gamma in terms of velocity.

Wait, let me think about the energies.

We have K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²

K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c²

And K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So, substituting m2 = m1/2,

K1 + K2 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c² + (gamma2 -1) (m1/2) c² = 3 GeV.

We can factor m1 c²:

m1 c² [ (gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) (1/2) ) ] = 3 GeV.

But m1 c² is 0.66 M c², which is 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.

Wait, M c² is 300 GeV. So m1 c² is 0.66 * 300 = 198 GeV.

So substituting,

198 GeV [ (gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) * 0.5 ] = 3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 198 GeV,

(gamma1 -1) + 0.5 (gamma2 -1) ) = 3 / 198 ≈ 0.0151515.

Okay, so that's equation A.

Now, from the momentum equations.

From equation 1 and 2:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But m1 = 2 m2 → m2 = m1/2.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 (m1/2) v2.

Cancel m1,

gamma1 v1 = (gamma2/2) v2.

But v2 is in the opposite direction, so perhaps we should write |v1| and |v2|?

Wait, no, because in the equations, the momentum vectors are opposite. So p1 = -p2.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write the magnitudes.

So, |p1| = |p2|

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since v1 and v2 are in opposite directions, but their magnitudes are the same because p1 and p2 have the same magnitude. Wait, no, because the direction is opposite, but the magnitudes are same.

Wait, no, it's |p1| = |p2|.

So, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But m1 = 2 m2 → m2 = m1/2.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 (m1/2) v2.

Divide both sides by m1,

gamma1 v1 = (gamma2 / 2) v2.

But because the fragments are moving in opposite directions, I think v2 is in the opposite direction, but when considering the magnitudes, perhaps we can take their absolute values.

So let's write |v1| and |v2|. So,

gamma1 |v1| = (gamma2 |v2| ) / 2.

Hmm. So,

gamma1 |v1| = (gamma2 |v2| ) / 2.

But we also have the energy equations.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c², and the total is 3 GeV, and the masses are fixed, perhaps we can find the ratio of the velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps using beta factors.

Beta is v/c, so beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

Then, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta1^2 )

Similarly for gamma2.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can express gamma in terms of velocity and use the momentum and energy equations.

Another thought: Let me define beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

So, gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta1^2 )

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta2^2 )

From the momentum equation,

gamma1 m1 beta1 c = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

Because p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

Since m1 = 2 m2,

gamma1 (2 m2) beta1 c = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

Divide both sides by m2 c,

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

So,

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1. → Equation B.

Now, from the energy equation (K1 + K2 =3 GeV):

K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²

K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c²

So,

(gamma1 -1) m1 c² + (gamma2 -1) m2 c² = 3 GeV.

With m1 = 2 m2,

(gamma1 -1) 2 m2 c² + (gamma2 -1) m2 c² = 3 GeV.

Factor m2 c²,

m2 c² [ 2(gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) ) ] =3 GeV.

But m1 + m2 = 0.99 M → m1 = 2 m2 → 3 m2 =0.99 M → m2 =0.33 M.

So m2 c² = 0.33 M c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

So,

99 GeV [2 (gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) ] =3 GeV → [2(gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1)] = 3 /99 ≈ 0.0303.

So,

2 gamma1 -2 + gamma2 -1 = 0.0303 → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Equation C: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Now, from Equation B: gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

But we need another equation to relate beta1 and beta2.

Wait, perhaps we can express beta2 in terms of beta1.

Wait, but I don't have another equation yet. Alternatively, perhaps considering the relationship between gamma and beta, since gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - beta^2)).

Alternatively, perhaps I can express gamma2 in terms of gamma1 and beta ratios.

From equation B,

gamma2 = (2 gamma1 beta1) / beta2.

But I don't know beta2 in terms of beta1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps using the relativistic velocity addition formula. But that's for when two objects are moving relative to each other, which may not apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find an expression for beta1 and beta2, but this might get complicated.

Another approach: let's assume that the non-relativistic approximation is a good starting point, but we know that when the velocities are low, gamma is approximately 1 + (1/2) beta². But in reality, for high energies, we can't ignore relativistic effects.

Wait, but the problem is to find the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic T1.

So perhaps we can first compute the non-relativistic case, then the relativistic case, and find the difference.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is given by (1/2) m v².

But let's proceed.

In non-relativistic scenario:

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Because the initial momentum is zero, so the momenta are equal and opposite.

So,

m1 v1 = m2 v2.

But m1=2 m2 → 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 v1 = v2.

So v2 = 2 v1.

Then, the kinetic energies are:

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1².

K2 = (1/2) m2 v2².

Sum K1 + K2 = (1/2)(2 m2) v1² + (1/2)(m2)(2 v1)^2.

= (m2 v1²) + (1/2 m2)(4 v1²) )

= m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1².

But from earlier,

K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

But m2 is 0.33 M, which is 0.33 * 300 GeV/c² = 99 GeV/c².

Wait, units are a bit tricky here, but since we're working in units where c=1 (GeV and GeV/c²), perhaps I can proceed.

Wait, in non-relativistic terms, energy is (1/2) m v², and m is in GeV/c², v in c units. So perhaps we can express v as a fraction of c, say beta = v/c. Then, v² = beta² c², so (1/2) m v² = (1/2) m (beta² c²) = (1/2) (m c²) beta².

But let me proceed.

We have m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

m2 is 99 GeV/c².

So,

(99 GeV/c²) * v1^2 = 1 GeV → v1^2 = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) * c^2 → v1^2 = (1/99) c² → v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1 c.

So, beta1 ≈ 0.1, and beta2 = 2 beta1 ≈ 0.2.

Thus, the non-relativistic KE for fragment 1 (T1_classical) is (1/2) m1 v1².

m1 is 198 GeV/c².

So,

T1_classical = 0.5 * 198 GeV/c² * (0.1 c)^2.

= 0.5 * 198 * 0.01 c².

But c² in GeV²/(GeV/c²)² → units would be GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it numerically.

0.5 * 198 * 0.01 = 0.5 * 1.98 = 0.99 GeV.

Wait, that's 990 MeV, which seems high. Hmm, but wait, the total KE is 3 GeV, so if T1_classical is ~1 GeV, then T2_classical is ~2 GeV, which sums to 3 GeV. But that can't be right, because in reality, the more massive fragment would have lower KE.

Wait, but wait, in the non-relativistic case, because m1 is larger, but v1 is lower. Let me recalculate.

Wait m1 is 198 GeV/c², v1 is (c / sqrt(99)).

So,

v1 = c * (1/√99) ≈ c * 0.1.

So,

v1^2 = c^2 / 99.

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) * (198 GeV/c²) * (c^2 /99) ) → (1/2) * (198 /99) GeV → (1/2)*2 GeV → 1 GeV.

So T1_classical is 1 GeV.

Wait, but the total KE is 3 GeV, and if T1 is 1 GeV, then T2_classical is 2 GeV. That's consistent.

But wait, in reality, the KE distribution is not the same as in the non-relativistic case because of relativistic effects.

So, now, let's compute the correct relativistic T1.

We have to solve for gamma1 and gamma2 using the equations we have.

From earlier, we have equation C: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

And equation B: gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

But we need another equation to relate beta1 and beta2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express beta in terms of gamma.

We know that beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So,

beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2 )

beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2 )

But from equation B,

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

So,

gamma2 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2 ) = 2 gamma1 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2 )

Hmm, complicated equation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make an approximation. Since the velocities are small (as in the non-relativistic case, v is about 0.1 c), maybe the relativistic effects are small. But wait, let's see. If gamma is about 1 + (1/2) beta^2. Let's assume gamma is near 1. Since beta is 0.1, gamma ≈ 1.005.

Wait, let's test that.

If beta is 0.1,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.01) ≈ 1/(sqrt(0.99)) ≈ 1.005.

So, the relativistic correction to gamma is about 0.5% or so.

But perhaps that's not enough to cause a 20 MeV difference. The options are in the range of a few MeV.

Wait, but let me proceed with the equations.

We have equation C: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Equation B: gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

Using the expressions for beta in terms of gamma,

beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2 )

beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2 )

So,

gamma2 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2 ) = 2 gamma1 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2 ).

Hmm. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

gamma2^2 (1 - 1/gamma2^2 ) = 4 gamma1^2 (1 - 1/gamma1^2 )

→ gamma2^2 * ( (gamma2^2 -1)/gamma2^2 ) ) =4 gamma1^2 ( (gamma1^2 -1)/gamma1^2 )

Simplify:

(gamma2^2 -1 ) =4 (gamma1^2 -1 )

So,

gamma2^2 -1 =4 gamma1^2 -4.

→ gamma2^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

But from equation C, 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303 → gamma2 =3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

So,

gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

We can substitute this into the equation gamma2^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

So,

(3.0303 - 2 gamma1 )^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Expanding the left side:

(3.0303)^2 - 2*3.0303* 2 gamma1 + (2 gamma1)^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Compute each term:

(3.0303)^2 ≈ 9.182.

-2 *3.0303 *2 gamma1 = -12.1212 gamma1.

(2 gamma1)^2 =4 gamma1^2.

So,

9.182 -12.1212 gamma1 +4 gamma1^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Subtract 4 gamma1^2 from both sides:

9.182 -12.1212 gamma1 = -3.

Bring all terms to left:

9.182 +3 -12.1212 gamma1 =0 →12.182 -12.1212 gamma1 =0.

So,

12.1212 gamma1 =12.182 → gamma1 ≈12.182 /12.1212 ≈1.00503.

Approximately 1.005.

So gamma1 ≈1.005.

Then, from equation C, gamma2 =3.0303 -2*(1.00503) →3.0303 -2.01006=1.01998≈1.02.

So gamma2≈1.02.

Now, let's find beta1 and beta2:

beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2 )) → sqrt(1 -1/(1.005)^2 )

1/(1.005)^2≈1/(1.010025)= approx 0.99005.

So 1 -0.99005=0.00995 → sqrt(0.00995)= approx 0.09975 → ~0.09975 c.

Similarly, beta2 = sqrt(1 -1/(1.02)^2 ) → 1/(1.0404)=0.9611 → 1-0.9611=0.0389 → sqrt(0.0389)=0.1972 → ~0.1972 c.

So beta1≈0.09975, beta2≈0.1972.

Now, let's compute the actual K1 and K2.

K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

m1 c²=198 GeV.

gamma1≈1.005 → gamma1-1=0.005.

So,

K1=0.005 *198 GeV= 0.99 GeV= 990 MeV.

K2= (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

gamma2≈1.02 → gamma2-1=0.02.

m2 c²=99 GeV.

K2=0.02 *99=1.98 GeV=1980 MeV.

Wait, but earlier the sum K1 + K2 was supposed to be 3 GeV. 990 +1980=2970 MeV=2.97 GeV, which is close to 3 GeV. So that's about right.

So, the relativistic T1 is 990 MeV, which is approximately 0.99 GeV.

Wait, but that's about the same as the non-relativistic T1 of 1 GeV. But wait, in the non-relativistic case, T1_classical was 1 GeV, and relativistic T1 is 0.99 GeV. So the difference would be about 10 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the non-relativistic gave T1_classical as 1 GeV, and the relativistic calculation gives T1_relativistic as 0.99 GeV. But wait, wait. Let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, earlier in the non-relativistic case, I found that T1_classical is 1 GeV. But in the relativistic case, it's 0.99 GeV.

So the difference is 0.01 GeV=10 MeV.

So the correct T1 is approximately 0.99 GeV, and the classical approximation is 1 GeV. So the difference is about 10 MeV.

Wait, but wait: in the non-relativistic approach, K1_classical is 1 GeV, and in reality, K1 is 0.99 GeV. So the difference is 100 MeV? No, no, wait. 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 1 GeV -0.99 GeV=0.01 GeV=10 MeV.

Ah, so the correct T1 is lower than the non-relativistic value by 10 MeV.

So the difference is 10 MeV.

So the correct answer would be option C, which is 10 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process and calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using both relativistic and non-relativistic approaches, then find the difference between the two.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial nucleus**: Rest mass energy = \( Mc^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \).
2. **Fission fragments**: 
   - Fragment 1 (more massive): \( m_1 = 2m_2 \).
   - Fragment 2 (less massive): \( m_2 \).
   - Total rest mass of fragments: \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \).
   - Mass defect: \( \Delta m = M - (m_1 + m_2) = 0.01M \), which is converted into kinetic energy.

### Step 1: Fragment Rest Masses
From \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \):
\[
m_1 = 0.66M, \quad m_2 = 0.33M.
\]
Thus:
\[
m_1 c^2 = 0.66 \times 300 = 198 \, \text{GeV}, \quad m_2 c^2 = 0.33 \times 300 = 99 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Total Kinetic Energy
The total kinetic energy of the two fragments is equal to the energy released due to the mass defect:
\[
K_1 + K_2 = \Delta m c^2 = 0.01 \times 300 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Non-Relativistic Approximation
In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is given by \( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \). Using conservation of momentum:
\[
m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_2 = 2v_1.
\]
The total kinetic energy is:
\[
K_1 + K_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 (2v_1)^2.
\]
Substituting \( m_2 = \frac{m_1}{2} \):
\[
K_1 + K_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + 2 m_1 v_1^2 = \frac{5}{2} m_1 v_1^2.
\]
Since \( K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\frac{5}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_1^2 = \frac{6}{5m_1}.
\]
Substituting \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \):
\[
v_1^2 = \frac{6}{5 \times 198} = \frac{6}{990} \, c^2.
\]
Thus:
\[
K_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 198 \times \frac{6}{990} = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Relativistic Calculation
In the relativistic case, kinetic energy is given by:
\[
K = (\gamma - 1) m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}.
\]
From conservation of momentum and energy, the relativistic calculations yield:
\[
\gamma_1 \approx 1.005, \quad \gamma_2 \approx 1.02.
\]
Thus:
\[
K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) m_1 c^2 = (1.005 - 1) \times 198 = 0.99 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 5: Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)
The non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \), and the relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} - 0.99 \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic values of \( T_1 \) is **10 MeV**.
