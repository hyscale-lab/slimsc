Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and whether certain stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking how many of the listed stars can be detected by ESPRESSO when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The condition is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. 

First, I need to understand what ESPRESSO is capable of. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for studying exoplanets and other astrophysical phenomena. It's mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. High resolution usually means it can detect fainter stars because it can gather more detailed spectra, but I'm not too sure about the specifics.

Each option (a to f) describes a star. Let me list them out:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star at 10 pc, V=15
d) Star at 200 pc, V=15
e) Star at 5 pc, V=15
f) Star at 50 pc, V=15

Wait, V magnitude is the apparent magnitude in the V band (visual). So absolute magnitude is given as 15 for options c, d, e, f. But wait, no: the 'absolute V magnitude' is 15 for each of those. So the absolute magnitude (M) is 15. The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

Wait no, actually the distance modulus is m - M = 5 log10(d) -5, so m = M + 5(log10 d) -5.

So for each of these stars (c, d, e, f), the absolute magnitude is 15. Let me calculate their apparent magnitudes for each distance.

Let's go one by one.

Option c: 10 pc.

m = 15 + 5 log10(10) -5 = 15 +5(1) -5 = 15+5=20-5=15? Wait wait, no, that wouldn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think.

The formula is m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1). Because d is in parsecs. Or is it m - M = 5 log10(d) -5? So, m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

Right, so for d=10 pc, log10(10)=1.

So m = 15 + (5 *1) -5 = 15 +5 -5 =15. So apparent magnitude is 15.

But wait, Canopus and Polaris are real stars, so I think they have known apparent magnitudes. Let me remember: Canopus is one of the brightest stars. I think
