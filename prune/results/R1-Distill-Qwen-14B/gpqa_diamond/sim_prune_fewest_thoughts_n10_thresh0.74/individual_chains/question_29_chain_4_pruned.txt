Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The approach is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and then they sequenced the gene in all mutants. Some changes are in the first exon area.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I think that would mean disrupting the gene's function so it doesn't produce the compound anymore. So, probably a mutation that disrupts the gene's coding sequence, like a nonsense or frameshift mutation.

Looking at the options, all of them have changes in the beginning of the sequence, the first exon. Let's look at each mutant and see what their changes are.

The intact gene is given as:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
I notice that the first three nucleotides are ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then follows TTT, which would be phenylalanine, then CTC, etc.

Now, let's check each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compare to the intact gene. Let's see where the changes are.

Original first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant 1: ATG T TCT ACG C... Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes occur. Let me break it down.

Original: positions 4-6: TTT, then positions 7-9: CTC, then 10-12: GCT

Mutant 1: positions 4-6: TCT, positions 7-9: ACG, then 10-12: GCT? Wait, maybe I should compare each nucleotide.

Looking at each triplet:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT (same?), no. Wait, the first part of the mutant is ATGTTCTACGCT...

Wait, perhaps I should line them up:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TT...
Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTC GCG...

Wait, maybe I'm getting the letters wrong. Let me look at the sequences.

Wait, the intact gene starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT...

Wait, first, the intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant 1 changes: first exon.

But perhaps it's better to look for the exact changes.

Let me write the sequences for each
