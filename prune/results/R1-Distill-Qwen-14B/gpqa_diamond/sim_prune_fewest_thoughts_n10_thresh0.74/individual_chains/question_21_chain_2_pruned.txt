Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about isomers, tautomerism, and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers can be constitutional or stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different structures but the same formula, while stereoisomers are about the arrangement in space, like cis-trans or enantiomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Let me start with part A. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, changing the structure. Like how keto and enol forms are tautomers. So which of the given compounds can't undergo this?

Benzoquinone. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone is a di-ketone, so maybe it can undergo some tautomerism. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, quinones are typically cyclic, and if the structure doesn't have adjacent H's, maybe tautomerism isn't possible. Let me think. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups opposite each other, I think in para positions. So each carbonyl is on a benzene ring, but for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. Wait, in a quinone structure, the carbonyl groups are attached to the benzene ring. So the adjacent carbons are part of the ring, which are spÂ² hybridized. So they don't have hydrogens attached. Because in a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to other carbons or substituents. So, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons (the ones in the ring) don't have hydrogens. So there are no alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism can't occur. So benzoquinone wouldn't show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait, cyclohexane-1,
