Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds—that means I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to think about special relativity here.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are given as A to D, each with different relative speeds and energies.

First, I need to tackle the relative speed. I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just add them like you would in classical mechanics. The formula for relative velocity is something like (v1 - v2) divided by (1 minus the product of their speeds over c squared). Wait, let me get that right. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait. Since both astronauts are moving in the same direction, their velocities are positive. So the relative speed of the slower one from the faster one's perspective would be subtraction. Let me assign astronaut A as 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B as 3m moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's the speed of B?

Actually, no. Wait, the question is asking for the relative speed between the two. So in the rest frame of astronaut A, the speed of astronaut B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, but I'm probably mixing up the frames. Alternatively, perhaps the relative speed is calculated from the perspective of one astronaut to the other. Let's say we're in the frame where astronaut A is at rest. Then astronaut B is moving. So using the velocity addition formula.

So v_rel = (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)).

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula for the relative velocity of B as seen from A's frame is (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, if the frame S is where A is at rest, then the speed of B in S is v_B' = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). So substituting the values:

v_A = 0.6c, v_B =0.5c.

So v_B' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: (0.5 -0.6)c = (-0.1)c. So the negative sign indicates direction. But since speed is magnitude, we can take the absolute value for the relative speed. 

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²) / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_B' = (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. But the speed is positive, so 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, which matches options C and D.

Wait, but the question is about the relative speed, so the magnitude is 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel =0.14c. So now the question is about the total energy.

Total energy of the system would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Because they're in different frames, but in the same initial frame, perhaps. Wait, the problem says what's the total energy of the system. So I think I should compute the relativistic energy for each astronaut in the same frame and add them together.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the frame for the total energy. Hmm, but in the rest frame of the system, perhaps? Or maybe the initial frame, which is the one where both are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c. Wait, no, I think each astronaut is in their own frame, but the question is about the total energy in the same frame where both are moving. Hmm, no, maybe it's in the lab frame where both are moving. Wait, but it's not specified, which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the frame in which the total momentum is considered, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So it's the sum of the energies of both astronauts in the same frame. Let's assume the frame is the one where the two astronauts are moving at their respective velocities, but wait, that frame doesn't exist because each is moving. Hmm, perhaps I should compute the energies in the lab frame. Or perhaps the frame where the combined system is at rest? No, that's the center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, but the question is about the total energy, which would be the sum of their energies as observed from a particular frame. But the problem doesn't specify the frame, so perhaps we're to compute it in the original frame where the two are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c. Or perhaps, wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous, but maybe the intended approach is to compute the energies in their own rest frames and add them, but I don't think so.

Wait, no. The total energy of the system from any frame would be the sum of their energies in that frame. So I think the question is asking, in the lab frame where both are moving, what's the sum of their energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is the rest frame of the combined system. Because when you add velocities, you might be considering the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the sum of their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies. But that seems unlikely because in their rest frames, their kinetic energy would be zero. No, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says, "the total energy of the system." Assuming that the system is the two astronauts, the total energy in a particular frame would be the sum of their energies in that frame. But which frame is that?

Wait, perhaps the initial frame (their own frame, but that's not possible unless they're at rest). Alternatively, perhaps the rest frame of the combined system, which is the center of momentum frame.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me perhaps approach this step by step.

First, find the relative speed between the two astronauts. We did that: about 0.14c.

Now, for the total energy, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of their energies in the lab frame where they are moving. Or perhaps, the sum of their rest energies. Wait, no, because that would be (2m +3m)c² =5mc², which is option D's E=5mc². But option C has E=5.96 mc², which is higher.

Wait, I think I need to compute each astronaut's relativistic energy in the same frame and sum them. Let me proceed.

In the lab frame, the two astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c. So their energies are:

E_A = gamma * m_A c²
E_B = gamma * m_B c²

Where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A (mass 2m, v=0.6c):

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) =1/0.8=1.25.

E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut B (mass 3m, v=0.5c):

gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) =1/sqrt(0.75)= approx 1.1547.

E_B= 1.1547 *3m c² ≈3.464 mc².

So total energy E_total = 2.5 +3.464 =5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc². Look at the options. Option C has E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is just the sum of their rest energies. So which is it?

Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So if the system is viewed in the same lab frame (i.e., the frame where both are moving as given), then the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies, which is 5.96 mc². So that would match option C.

But wait, another thought: the system's total energy in that frame would be the sum of their energies in that frame. So yes, E_total =5.96 mc².

So looking at the options, option C has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc^2. So that's the correct choice.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (for the astronaut with mass \(2m\)) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (for the astronaut with mass \(3m\)). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut (\(2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut (\(3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
