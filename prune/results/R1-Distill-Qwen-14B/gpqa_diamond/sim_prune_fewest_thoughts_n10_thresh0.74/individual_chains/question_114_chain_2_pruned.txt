Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Okay, the first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A giving 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually through a substitution. Oh wait, right! The Prins reaction? Or maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, cyanohydrin formation. So ketones reacting with CN- in an acidic condition.

So for cyanohydrin formation, the ketone (like butan-2-one) reacts with cyanide ions (from NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of a new alcohol and nitrile group.

So what's reagent A in this case? It's probably H3O+ because that's a common acid catalyst. Or wait, sometimes NaHSO3 is used. Oh wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. But in this case, maybe A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. It's reacting with reagent B in H2O to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Acidic hydrolysis usually involves using H2SO4 and H2O, often with heat. The nitrile converts to an amide first, then to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, sometimes HCl is used as a catalyst in such reactions.

Wait, but in this case, the reagent is B in H2O. So what's B? If the reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid, the conditions would be H2O and an acid. So perhaps B is HCl. Because when you have H2O and HCl, it can act as the acid catalyst for the hydrolysis.

Let me check the options. Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl
Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH
Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl
Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

Wait, so for the first reaction, if A is H3O+, that makes sense for the cyanohydrin formation. So option A or B would have A as H3O+. Then, for the second reaction, the reagent B in H2O is either HCl or something else.

But wait, in acidic hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, you typically use strong acid conditions. HCl is a strong acid, so B would be HCl. So looking at the options, options A and
