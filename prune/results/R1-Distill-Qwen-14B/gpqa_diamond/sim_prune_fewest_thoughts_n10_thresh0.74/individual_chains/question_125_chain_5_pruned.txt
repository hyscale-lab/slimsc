Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². They're asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

I remember that the 3D harmonic oscillator is a common problem. Oh right, in 3D, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed in terms of the total quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = ħω (n + 3/2). Or wait, maybe n is the sum, and each direction contributes n_i, so the total energy is (n + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, no, I think more accurately, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so the total energy is the sum. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

But wait, another way to think about it is in terms of the quantum number n, where n
