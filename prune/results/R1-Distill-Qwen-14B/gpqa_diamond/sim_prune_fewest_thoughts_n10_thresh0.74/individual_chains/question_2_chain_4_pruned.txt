Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Trans means the substituents are on opposite sides, but I'm not entirely sure how that affects the reactions yet. The structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde is probably something like an aromatic ring (benzene) with a propenal group attached, right? So, the aldehyde is at one end of the double bond.

The first reaction is treating this with methylmagnesium bromide. I think that's a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents typically add to carbonyl groups. So, adding methyl groups to the aldehyde. But wait, aldehyde is a carbonyl, so when Grignard adds, it should form a secondary alcohol, right? So, the aldehyde (RCHO) would become RCH(OH)CH2 after adding the Grignard. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Grignard adds twice to ketones, but aldehydes only once because there's only one R group. Oh wait, no, Grignard adds once to aldehydes and ketones. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me correct: Grignard reagents react with aldehydes to form secondary alcohols. Because the aldehyde is RCHO, adding the Grignard (like R'MgX) would give RCH(OH)R'. So in this case, methyl Grignard would add to the aldehyde, giving RCH(OH)CH3.

Wait, wait, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. Structure is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CH=O, but wait, no, that's not right. Let me
