Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound starting from benzene. The target compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, ethan-1-one is acetone, which is (propan-2-one, but wait, maybe I should just think of it as a ketone). So, the structure has a phenyl ring attached to the ketone group. The substituents on the phenyl ring are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5. Wait, wait, numbering in phenyl groups can be a bit tricky. Let me think: the ketone is at position 1, so the phenyl is attached to it. Then, the substituents are on the benzene ring. So, if the phenyl is attached to the ketone (position 1), then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to that point. Oh wait, no: when you have a substituent attached to the ring, the numbering starts from that point as position 1. Wait no, that's for substituents on the main chain. Wait, no, in the IUPAC nomenclature for phenyl groups, the substituents are numbered based on the attachment point.

Wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group is attached to the ketone at position 1 (so the ketone is at the end of a two-carbon chain, with the phenyl on one end and the carbonyl on the other). The substituents on the phenyl are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5. Let me draw this. The benzene ring has the substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So, looking at the ring, from the point of attachment (position 1), the next positions would be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, the Br is at position 3, which is two positions away from the attachment point, and the nitro is at position 5, which is four positions away. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that the substituents are at the meta and para positions with respect to each other, but I might be getting confused.

Wait, no, the benzene ring attached to the ketone has substituents at positions 3 and 5. So, the positions are arranged as follows: the ketone is at position 1 (where the benzene is attached). Then, position 2 is adjacent, position 3 is next, etc. So substituents at 3 and 5 would be in a way that they are meta to each other. Or wait, 3 and 5 are two positions apart in a six-membered ring. Let me imagine the benzene ring with the ketone at position 1. Then, position 3 would be two carbons away, and position 5 would be four away. Wait, but that's the same as position 3 on the opposite side. Hmm, maybe it's better to think that the substituents are at positions that are across from each other, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should focus on the synthetic steps instead.

The starting material is benzene, and we need to add substituents to get the target. So, the target has two substituents on the benzene ring: Br at position 3 and NO2 at position 5, and a ketone group (attached at position 1). Wait, no: the ketone is at the position where the benzene is attached. So the benzene has a substituent (the ketone group, which is part of the ethanone structure) attached at position 1, and then substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to that attachment.

Wait
