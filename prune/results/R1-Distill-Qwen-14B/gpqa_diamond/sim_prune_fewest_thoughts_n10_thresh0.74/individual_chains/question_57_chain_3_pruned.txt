Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electron scattering and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed using the partial waves. The formula is something like f(θ, φ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) ) ), where δ_l are the phase shifts. But wait, since we're looking for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which would be when θ is 0 degrees, right? Because the incident beam is coming straight in, so the scattering angle θ is zero.

So, for θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1) = 1. That simplifies things a lot. So the amplitude becomes f(0, φ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * 1 ). 

But wait, we're only considering the imaginary part of f. So, let's write e^{iδ} as cosδ + i sinδ. The imaginary part of f would then be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term in the sum. 

Each term's contribution to the imaginary part is (1/k) * (2
