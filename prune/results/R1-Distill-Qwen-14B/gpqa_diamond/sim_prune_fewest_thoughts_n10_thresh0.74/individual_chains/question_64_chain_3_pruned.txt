Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each part.

So, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200Â°C without air. Heating them produces a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes.

The tubes are filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (tube 1), Ca(OH)2 solution (tube 2), and red-hot copper (tube 3). The results are:

- Tube 1's weight increased by 3.60g.
- Tube 3's weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed.
- Tube 2's weight didn't change.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose to form gases. The gases pass through the tubes, and each tube reacts with specific substances.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, but since it's anhydrous, maybe it's absorbing moisture? Or perhaps it's reacting with something else. Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is used as a desiccant, so it probably absorbs water. But if the gas is a mixture, maybe it's absorbing a hydrated gas or a gas that can form hydrates. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a water-containing vapor. Wait, but when heated, salts usually decompose. So maybe the salts A and B decompose into gases like NH3, CO2, H2O, etc.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas reacts with Ca(OH)2, that would mean it's a gas like CO2, NH3 (which is basic), or maybe H2S. But if the weight didn't change, perhaps the gas wasn't absorbed by Ca(OH)2. So maybe the gas that passed through didn't react with Ca(OH)2, meaning it's a neutral gas like N2 or something inert.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. If the gas reacts with copper, it's probably a gas that can reduce CuO, like H2, CO, or maybe NH3? Or perhaps it's oxygen, but oxygen wouldn't react with copper unless it's in a different state. Wait, but the copper is red-hot, so maybe it's reacting with a gas to form CuO. So, for example, if the gas is H2, it might reduce CuO when heated. Wait, no, the problem says that CuO is formed in tube 3. So the gas must have reacted with copper to form CuO. So perhaps the gas is water vapor? No, because water wouldn't react with red-hot copper
