Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, so let's break this down.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. Since it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, the two substituents are in positions that make the compound either ortho, meta, or para. But wait, the compound also has 8 carbon atoms in total. Let me think: the benzene ring itself is 6 carbons. So the two substituents contribute 2 more carbons, but wait, that would make 8. But wait, substituents can have more than one carbon each. Hmm, wait, maybe each substituent is a single carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is a group with more carbons. Let me do some math.

Wait, the benzene ring has 6 carbons. The molecule has 8 carbons, so the substituents account for 2 additional carbons. So each substituent is probably one carbon, or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, wait, the substituents have to be present because it's a di-substituted. Oh, wait, maybe one substituent is a methyl group (1 carbon) and the other is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or something), but wait, carbonyl doesn't add a carbon necessarily. Wait, no, the substituents are attached to the ring, so each substituent contributes their number of carbons. Let me think again.

Wait, the molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. So the substituents could be two methyl groups (each adding one carbon, but wait, 6 + 2 =8, but then each substituent is a methyl group. But wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. So one substituent is a carbonyl group. Carbonyl groups can be like a ketone (like a CO group attached), but that wouldn't add a carbon. Wait, no, wait: if the substituent is an acetyl group (like CH2CO-), that would add more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone (CO attached directly to the ring), which would only add one carbon in that substituent? No, wait, the substituent would be CO something. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Because the FTIR shows both a carbonyl peak and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, like a ketone (C=O), and the other is a halogen (like Cl or Br). But wait, the carbonyl group would be part of the substituent attached to the ring. So, if a substituent is a carbonyl group, like in acetophenone (where the substituent is a
