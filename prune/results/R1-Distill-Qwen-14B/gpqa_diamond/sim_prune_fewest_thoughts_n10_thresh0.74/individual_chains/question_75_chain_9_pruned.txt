Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, specifically about creating a transgenic mouse model. The person is trying to overexpress a protein called GADD45G, but it's not working as expected. They've modified the gene to add a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are using antibiotic resistance to select the cells. But when they test the expression, the protein isn't overexpressing. The question is why.

So, the plus strand sequence they provided is given, and I need to look for any issues in the construct that would prevent proper expression. Let me think about what each part of the construct needs.

First, the construct should have a promoter, the coding sequence with the HA tag, and a selection marker (like an antibiotic resistance gene). But since the problem is about expression, I'm focusing on the coding sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then comes the HA tag sequence. But wait, the HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The HA tag sequence is usually added at the N-terminus, so the coding sequence should start with the HA sequence followed by the GADD45G sequence.

Looking at the provided sequence, the very beginning is ATG, which is methionine. Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but the HA tag is a peptide sequence, which would require specific codons. Oh, but wait, the HA tag is added as a DNA sequence encoding the protein. So the construct should have the HA tag coding sequence right after the start codon.

Let me recall the HA tag's amino acid sequence. The HA tag is typically YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA sequence for that would be something like TAC TTT CTT GTA TTA TAT TTA TAT (but I can't remember the exact sequence, but I know TAC is tyrosine, which is the start of the HA tag).

Wait, looking at the given sequence, the first few codons after ATG are TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline
