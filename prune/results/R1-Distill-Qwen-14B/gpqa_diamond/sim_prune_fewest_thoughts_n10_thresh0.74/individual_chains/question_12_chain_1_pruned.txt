Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me see. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) plus a neutrino. Oh wait, the neutrino is usually denoted as nu, but in this case, it's written as nu. So the equation is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu.

The problem states that the Pi(+) is stationary, which probably simplifies things because then the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That makes sense because the law of conservation of momentum says that the total momentum before equals the total after. Since Pi was at rest, the products' momenta must cancel each other out.

The rest masses given are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but the neutrino is a lepton, and I remember that neutrinos have very tiny masses, but for these kinds of problems, sometimes they're approximated as massless. Or maybe not? Hmm, I think in beta decay problems, we often neglect the neutrino's mass because it's negligible. But I'm not entirely sure in this case. The problem doesn't specify the neutrino's mass, so I might assume it's zero. Or maybe it's included in some way.

So, the initial energy is the rest mass energy of the Pi(+) since it's stationary. Its energy is just m_pi c squared, which is 139.6 MeV. The products are the muon and the neutrino. So the total energy after the decay has to account for both particles' rest energies and their kinetic energies.

Wait, but the neutrino doesn't have rest mass (assuming), so its energy would just be its kinetic energy. But if the muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, then its energy would be rest energy plus kinetic. So total energy after decay is m_mu c² + K_mu + E_nu.

But the initial energy is m_pi c², so m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + E_nu.

But also, since the Pi is at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me write that as p_mu
