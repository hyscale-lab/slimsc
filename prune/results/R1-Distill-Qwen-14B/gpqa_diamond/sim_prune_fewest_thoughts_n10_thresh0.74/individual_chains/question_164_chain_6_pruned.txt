Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and their periods are given as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Then, there's some spectroscopic data about radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. Each star orbits the common center of mass. The radial velocity amplitudes (K) are related to the mass ratio. The more massive star will have a smaller RV amplitude because it's moving less around the center of mass.

Wait, right. The formula I think is K1 / K2 = (M2 / M1). Or is it the other way around? Let me think. If M1 is larger, M2 is smaller, so M2/M1 is less than 1. So K1 would be larger than K2 if M1 is more massive than M2. Because the less massive star moves more, right?

So for system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. So K1 is 10, K2 is 5. Therefore, the ratio K1/K2 is 2. So M2/M1 = 2, which means M1/M2 = 1/2. So M1 is half the mass of M2? Wait, no. Wait, K1 is star 1's velocity, right? So K1 is proportional to M2, and K2 is proportional to M1. Because the more massive star moves less. So K1 = (2Ï€ G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), something like that. So the ratio K1/K2 = M2/(M1). So if K1 is 10 and K2 is 5, the ratio is 2. So M2 = 2 M1.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if K1 is larger than K2, then M2 is larger than M1. Because K1 is inversely proportional to M1. So yeah, K1 is proportional to M2.

So in system_1: K1=10, K2=5. So K1/K2=2= M2/M1. So M2 = 2 M1. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1. So the mass of system_1 is
