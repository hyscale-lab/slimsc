Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of reactions. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about two different reactions leading to products A and B, and I need to select the correct options from the given choices. Let's break it down.

First, the first reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi and then H+. I remember that BuLi is a strong base, a good nucleophile, and often used in deprotonation reactions. Maybe it's doing a conjugate addition or something like that.

Looking at the starting material, ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene... Let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring attached to a CH2-O- group. The oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me see: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but wait, 3-methyl would make it (CH2)2C=CH-? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached to the oxygen? Wait no, 1-yl is the substituent on position 1. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that's not right. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2? No, perhaps I should count the positions.

But-2-en-1-yl: the double bond is between C2 and C3. So structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, starting from the point of attachment. Wait, when it's 1-yl, the point of attachment is the first carbon. So for but-2-en-1-yl, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- group, but attached via the first carbon. So
