Okay, so I've been given this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The question asks how many of the listed stars would be detectable based on a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

First, I need to understand what factors determine whether ESPRESSO can detect a star. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph designed for observations across a wide range of wavelengths. It's used for things like detecting exoplanets, studying stellar populations, and more. 

The key here is figuring out the S/N ratio per binned pixel. I think the S/N depends on several factors: the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the spectrograph's efficiency and noise characteristics.

The formula I recall for S/N is something like S/N = (flux) * sqrt(exposure time) / noise. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Alternatively, I think that the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the brightness of the object. 

Wait, another approach: for a given signal, the S/N increases with the square root of the exposure time. Since the exposure is fixed at 1 hour, the S/N depends on the star's apparent brightness. 

But how do I relate the absolute magnitude to the apparent magnitude, which affects the flux? Oh right, the distance modulus relates absolute magnitude (M) and apparent magnitude (m). The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs.

Each option gives the absolute V magnitude (M) and the distance. The V magnitude is related to the star's brightness as seen in the visual spectrum. 

So for each star, I can compute the apparent magnitude (m), then find the flux, calculate the S/N, and see if it meets the threshold of 10.

Let me go through each option:

Option a) Canopus. I know that Canopus is a bright star. Its apparent magnitude is around -0.7. So that's very bright. 

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star, and its apparent magnitude is about 2. I think. So it's visible to the naked eye, but not extremely bright.

Options c, d, e, f have stars with the same absolute magnitude (15 mag) but different distances. So their apparent magnitudes will vary based on distance.

Wait, for the options c, d, e, f: all have M = 15, V band, varying distances (10, 200, 5, 50 pc).

I remember that a higher apparent magnitude (m) means a fainter star. The scale is inverse, so lower m is brighter.

The formula for distance modulus is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), which simplifies to m = M + 5*(log10(d) - 1) = M +5 log10(d) -5.

So, for each distance d:

Option c: d=10 pc. Then log10(10)=1. So m =15 +5(1) -5=15 +5-5=15. So m=15.

Option e: d=5 pc. log10(5)=0.69897. So m=15 +5*(0.69897) -5 = 15 +3.495 -5=13.495, approximately 13.5.

Option f: d=50 pc. log10(50)=1.69897. So m=15 +5*(1.69897) -5 =15 +8.4949 -5=18.4949â‰ˆ18.5.

Option d: d=200 pc. log10(20
