Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum has peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. So, the molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, no, wait. Wait, di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, I think that's a benzene ring (6-membered) with two substituents. But the total number of carbons is 8. Wait, benzene has 6 carbons; with two substituents, each substituent is probably adding some carbons.

Wait, the substituents. Let's see. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group, which is a C=O. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so like a halogen attached to the ring. So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Or wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and another is a halogen. But wait, di-substituted means two substituents, so two groups attached to the benzene.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. So, if the molecule has a carbonyl group, that's probably an acyl group or maybe a ketone. But since it's attached to the benzene, perhaps it's a ketone substituent, like a benzophenone structure or something similar. But wait, no, benzophenone is two aryl groups attached to a ketone.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. So, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), and another is a halogen (like Cl or Br). But wait, how many carbons would that add?

Wait, the benzene has 6 carbons. The substituents are two in total, but each substituent's size will vary. If one substituent is a carbonyl group, like maybe a methyl group attached via a carbonyl.
