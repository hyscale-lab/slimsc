Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the setup is that there's a spin-half particle in a linear superposition of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The problem asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. And they mention that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. Right, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product of the state and the operator. So, ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator in question.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. I think expectation value is linear, so I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Wait, but wait. Since σz and σx don't commute, I can't just compute them separately and add, but wait, no, expectation values are linear regardless of whether the operators commute. Oh right, because expectation values are linear operators themselves. So yeah, I can compute each part separately.

So first, let's find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write that as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Wait, I should check if this is normalized. The sum of the squares should be 1.

Compute |a|² + |b|²: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. 0.25+0.75=1. So yes, it's normalized.

Now, σz is the Pauli z matrix, whose eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. So when you measure σz on |↑⟩, you get +1, and on |↓⟩, you get -1.

So the expectation value of σz is the probability of being in |↑⟩ times 1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times (-1). Or more formally, ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩.

But since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is actually a²*(1) + b²*(-1). Because when you apply σz to |↑⟩, you get |↑⟩*1, and similarly for |↓⟩.

So:

⟨σz⟩ = |a|² * (+1) + |b|² * (-1) = (0.5^2)*1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2*(-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 =
