Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying compound D based on a series of reactions. Let's break it down.

First, compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us the number of protons, and the splitting gives information about neighboring protons. 

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these protons are probably in a methyl group (since CH3 has three Hs, but here we have 6H) attached to something that has two neighboring protons. Like maybe they're adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but a triplet would mean they have two neighboring protons. So if each of these 6H is a methyl group attached to a CH2, then each methyl would be next to a CH2 group that has two protons. But wait, the other signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet implies each of those protons has three neighboring Hs. Because a quartet (n=3) comes from coupling with three equivalent protons.

Wait, let me think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H: Maybe it's a group where each H is adjacent to two others. So for example, two equivalent methyl groups (each CH3) attached to a central CH2. Like in neopentane, but that's 2,2-dimethylpropane. But the NMR would look different. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ethyl group. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think about the splitting. The triplet would have a neighboring group with two equivalent protons. So if the 6H are two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, that would give the triplet. Because each CH3 is next to a CH2 which has two Hs. So each CH3 would split into a triplet. The integration is 6H, so two CH3 groups.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. That's four Hs, each of which is next to three Hs. So maybe a CH2 group next to a CH that's connected to another CH
