Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons producing electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Wait, so the process is gamma plus gamma annihilating into e+ and e-. The reaction is γγ → e+ e-. I think this is a process that would have some energy threshold. Because for pair production to happen, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least enough to create the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. Oh right, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So each pair requires at least 1.022 MeV in total, but since they're photons, their combined energy has to be at least that. 

But wait, in this case, one photon is the high-energy gamma, and the other is the CMB photon. So the sum of their energies has to be at least 2 * m_e c², which is 1.022 MeV. So the condition is that E_gamma + E_cmb >= 1.022 MeV. But since the CMB photon is low energy, about 1e-3 eV, which is way less than 1 MeV. So for the reaction to happen, the gamma's energy must be around 1.022 MeV, right? Because E_cmb is negligible compared to the gamma's energy. Wait, but wait, that's not the case. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because the CMB photon's energy is not negligible for the threshold. Oh, because the threshold condition for pair production in two photon collisions is that the center-of-mass energy must be at least twice the electron mass. The formula for the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(2 E1 E2 (1 + cosθ)), but the maximum occurs when the photons are moving in the same direction, so cosθ is 1. So the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(2 E1 E2 * 2 ), which equals sqrt(4 E1 E2) = 2 sqrt(E1 E2).

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of invariant quantities. The invariant squared energy is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are massless, E = |p| c. So let me compute s:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/c) c + (E2/c) c )^2 ) * c²? Wait, no, units might get me confused. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1.

In natural units, E = |p|, because photons are massless. So the invariant squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 + p2)^2. 

Assuming the two photons are moving in the same direction, p1 and p2 are in the same direction, so p1
