Okay, so I have this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors: the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that factor cancels out when taking the ratio. Good, that simplifies things a bit.

The formula for equilibrium temperature (Te) is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Wait, no, wait. Let me get the exact formula right. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature equation is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25 

Wait, no, wait wait. I think I messed up the formula. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature is derived from the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The star emits energy as L = 4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4. The planet intercepts a cross-sectional area of π R_planet^2, but the planet emits from its entire surface, which is 4π R_planet^2. So the flux at the planet's orbit is (L / (4π a^2)), and the power absorbed is (1 - albedo) * (L / (4π a^2)) * π R_planet^2.

The planet emits as a blackbody: 4π R_planet^2 σ Te^4.

So setting them equal: (1 - a) * (L / (4π a^2)) * π R_p^2 = 4π R_p^2 σ Te^4.

Simplify this. The π R_p^2 cancels out on both sides. The 4π a^2 in denominator and the 4π in numerator of Te^4. Let's see:

(1 - a) * (L) / (4 a^2) = 4 σ Te^4.

But L is 4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4. So substitute that in:

(1 - a) * (4
