Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and jot down what I remember from my studies.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength for a black body, which relates to temperature via Wien's Law. Then, their radial velocities are given—Star_1 is not moving, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is about the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, and the options are A to D.

Hmm, so I think the first thing I need to do is figure out the temperatures of the two stars. Because luminosity depends on both radius and temperature, right? The formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but since we're looking for the ratio L1/L2, the constants will cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5, so R1²/R2² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that part handles the radius part.

Now, the temperatures. Since the peak wavelengths are the same, by Wien's Law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same, then T should be the same as well, right? Because if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says they have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So that's the peak emission, which is λ_max. So that would mean T1 = T2.

But wait, but the stars are moving. Oh, right, the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving towards or away. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So does that affect the observed wavelength? Because of the Doppler effect.

Oh, right! So the observed wavelength would be different due to the Doppler shift. But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual emitted λ_max is different because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The peak wavelength is determined by the star's temperature. But if the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted. So the actual emitted λ_max depends on the star's temperature, but we observe a shifted version because of the star's motion.

So the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1, since it's not moving, its observed λ_max is equal to its emitted λ_max. For Star_2, which is moving at 700 km/s, the observed λ_max is λ_emit,2 *
