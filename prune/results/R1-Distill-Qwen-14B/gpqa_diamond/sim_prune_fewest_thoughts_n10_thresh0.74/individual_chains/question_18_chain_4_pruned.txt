Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, let me read the problem carefully.

We have two stars: Star_1 with mass 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 with 1.2 solar masses. The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. They've provided some logarithmic abundance ratios.

The given values:

Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

We also have the solar photosphere composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

Wait, but what do these numbers mean? Oh right, the notation [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, is it [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun? So for any element, the abundance ratio is relative to the Sun.

Let me get the basics straight.

The [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of elements X and Y relative to their solar ratio. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X^sun / n_Y^sun) = log10( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X^sun / n_Y^sun) ) )

Alternatively, it's log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X^sun/n_Y^sun) ) ) = [X/Y]

Which can be rewritten as [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y) ) - log10( (n_X^sun / n_Y^sun) )

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means:

log10( (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) ) - log10( (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so:

log10(n_Fe1 / n_H1) - log10(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) = 0 → log10(n_Fe1 / n_H1) = log10(n_Fe_sun
