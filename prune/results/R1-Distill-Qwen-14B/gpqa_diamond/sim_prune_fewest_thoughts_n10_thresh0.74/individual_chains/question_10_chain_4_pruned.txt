Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density among the options given.

Let me read the options again carefully.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So this would be similar to Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I remember that from school. So if it's Earth-like, same mass and radius, then its density is 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Hmm, wait. The density here is given as 5.5. So does that mean it's the same as Earth's? But if the mass is twice Earth's, how does that affect the radius and density? Density is mass/volume. If the planet is more massive but the same density, I think the radius would be larger. But since the density is the same, the density here isn't higher than Earth's. So option b's density is 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Oh, same composition, so same density as Earth, which is 5.5. Wait, but if the mass is higher, wouldn't the radius also increase? Because density is mass divided by volume. So if density is same (because same composition), then mass is proportional to volume, and radius cubed. So a 5x mass would make the radius larger (cube root of 5 times Earth's radius). But the density remains same as Earth's. So the density here is 5.5.

Option d: A planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. So again, same composition implies same density. So density is 5.5 here as well.

Wait, but the question is which one has the highest density. All options except maybe a and d have 5.5? Wait, no. Let me check each again.

Wait, option a is Earth's mass and radius, so density 5.5. Option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So that's same as Earth. Option c is same composition (so same density) but 5 times mass. So same density. Option d same composition, same density.

Wait, but
