Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to figure out the output for the input sequence ACAGTGACC based on the given examples. The examples are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA ->176. Hmm, let me think about how these sequences are being converted into numbers.

First, I'll look at the first example: AGG becomes 115. Let's break down the letters. A is the first letter in the DNA alphabet, then G, then G again. Wait, but how does that translate into 115? Maybe each nucleotide is assigned a value. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let me check that. So for AGG:

A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. So adding them up: 1 +4 +4 =9. But the output is 115, which is way higher than 9. So that can't be it.

Hmm, maybe it's not just the sum. Let me think differently. Perhaps it's the product of the individual values. Let's see: 1 *4*4 =16. No, that's not 115 either. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe each nucleotide's value is multiplied by a power based on their position. Like the first letter is A (1) times 10^2, the second G (4) times 10^1, and the third G (4) times 10^0. So 1*100 +4*10 +4*1 =144. Still not 115. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of each nucleotide's value multiplied by their position. So for AGG, position 1 is A (1), position 2 is G (4), position 3 is G (4). So (1*1) + (4*2) + (4*3) = 1 +8 +12 =21. No, that's not 115. Hmm.

Wait, maybe each letter is converted to its ASCII value or some other numerical code. Let's check. The ASCII value for 'A' is 65, 'G' is 71. So AGG would be 65 +71 +71 =207. No, that's
