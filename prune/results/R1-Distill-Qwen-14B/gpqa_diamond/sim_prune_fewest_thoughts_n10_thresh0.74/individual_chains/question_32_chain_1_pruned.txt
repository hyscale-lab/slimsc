Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to accelerate a nucleus to a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, I think. So the mass number A is 6, so the atomic mass is about 6 atomic mass units (u).

Wait, but when dealing with relativistic speeds, I remember that the energy isn't just the kinetic energy but the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. Oh right, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So I need to calculate gamma for the given velocity and then multiply by the rest energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v=0.96c. So v² is 0.9216c². 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus X. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass. I think the mass can be approximated using the atomic mass. Each atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So wait, 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 MeV. Let me calculate that: 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the rest energy E_rest is 5.589 GeV. Then the total energy E is gamma multiplied by E_rest. So E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.589. Hmm, let's do 3.5714 *5 =17.857, 3.5714 *0.5=1.7857, 3.5714 *0.08=0.2857, 3.5714 *0.009=0.0321. Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply the two numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute
