Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives six substances, all substituted benzene rings, and asks about the para-isomer yield when they react with excess bromine. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are A to D, each a different order.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Depending on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's meta or para directing, the product distribution changes.

So each substituent's directing effects will determine where the bromine adds. For each compound, I'll need to figure out if the substituent is activating or deactivating, whether it's meta or para directing, and how that affects the major product.

Let me list each compound with their substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3 → substituent is methyl (CH3)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → substituent is ethyl ester (COOEt)
3) C6H5-Cl → substituent is Cl
4) C6H5-NO2 → substituent is nitro (NO2)
5) C6H5-C2H5 → substituent is ethyl (C2H5)
6) C6H5-COOH → substituent is carboxylic acid (COOH)

Wait, wait. Wait, in the problem statement, each substituent is attached to the benzene ring, right? So each is a monosubstituted benzene.

Now, for each substituent:

1) Methyl (CH3): It's an activating group because it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons via the inductive effect. It's an ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the major products would be the para and ortho isomers, but since it's a mono-substitution and bromine is in excess, but the question is about the para isomer's yield.

But wait, wait, the reaction is with excess bromine. So it's a di-substitution? Or mono? Hmm, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed, which suggests that each molecule adds one Br. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood. Oh, no, wait: the question states that each undergoes an electrophilic substitution to form a mono-bromo derivative. So each ring adds one Br substituent, making a di-substituted bromobenzene.

Wait, that might complicate things because substitution on a di-substituted ring is more about the position relative to the existing substituent. So for each substituent, the incoming Br will add either ortho, meta, or para to it.

Wait, but the substituent could be a strong deactivating group which might deactivate certain positions. Let me think again.

Each substituent is on the benzene ring. When bromine adds, the Br adds in position ortho, meta, or para to the existing substituent.

So the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer in each case. We need to arrange the six compounds based on how much para product each gives, from least to most.

Wait, but wait, the weight fraction. So if more para is formed, the higher the fraction. But the question asks for order of increasing weight fraction, so from least para to most.

Now, for each substituent:

1. Methyl (CH3): Activating, o/p director. So the major products are para and ortho. Which is more? For mono substituent, o and p are equally favored? Or is para more? Wait, activating groups often lead to para being major because the para position is more accessible, but in some cases, the ortho might be more hindered. Wait, I think that for substituents that are o/p directors, the para isomer is more favored than ortho because the ortho positions are less accessible (steric hindrance). So, for methyl, the para isomer would be the major product. So the weight fraction of para is high.

2. COOEt (ester group): That substituent is deactivating because ester is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). So it's meta directing. So the incoming Br would add meta to the ester group. So in this case, the para isomer won't form much. Wait, but wait, wait—no. Wait, the substituent is COOEt. So when Br adds, it's adding to the ring. The existing substituent is COOEt. So, where does the Br go?

Esters are meta directors because they are deactivating. So Br would add meta to the ester group. So the major product would be meta, not para. So for compound 2, the para isomer's yield is low.

3. Cl: Cl is a substituent that's ortho/para directing but deactivating. It's a deactivating because it's an EWG (due to being more electronegative), but it's still ortho/para director because it can donate electrons through resonance, but in reality, it's deactivating because the inductive effect dominates.

Wait, the substituents like Cl are deactivating but ortho/para directing. So when Br adds, the para position relative to Cl would be possible. So the para isomer would form, but Cl is deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive, but since it's o/p directing, so para is a possible major product.

Wait, but wait, when the substituent is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but the directing effect still holds. So in the case of Cl, the major product would be para (and ortho, but para has less steric hindrance), so more para than ortho. So the para fraction is significant.

4. NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta directing group. So the Br would add meta to the nitro group. So the para isomer won't form. So the para fraction is very low here.

5. C2H5 (ethyl): Similar to methyl, it's an activating, o/p director. So para is the major product. So a high para fraction.

6. COOH (carboxylic acid): It's a strong deactivating, meta directing group. So Br adds meta to the COOH group. So the para isomer isn't formed much, so its fraction is low.

Wait a minute, no, wait
