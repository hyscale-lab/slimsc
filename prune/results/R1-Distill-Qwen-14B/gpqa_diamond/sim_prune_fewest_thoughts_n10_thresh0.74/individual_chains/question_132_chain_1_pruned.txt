Okay, so I've got this question about NMR spectroscopy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that the 1H NMR spectrum of a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, each with the molecular formula C10H14, shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four pairs of compounds, and I need to figure out which pair is the correct mixture.

Hmm. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene derivative because the molecular formula is C10H14. Wait, benzene has six carbons, so four methyl groups would add four CH3 groups, making the formula C10H14 (since each methyl is CH3, adding 3*4=12 H, but wait, benzene has 6 H, so 6 - 4 (since each methyl replaces a H) = 2 H? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Adding four methyl groups (each is -CH3) would make it C10H14? Let me check: C6H6 + 4*(CH3) = C6 +4C = C10. H: 6 +4*3=18. But wait that's 18 H. But the molecular formula is C10H14, which has 14 H. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Oh wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, wait, maybe the molecular formula is correct because each methyl group replaces a hydrogen on the benzene ring. So for each methyl, you lose one H from the ring. So benzene has 6 H. Adding four methyl groups would reduce the H by four, so 6-4=2 H on the ring. Each methyl contributes 3 H. So four methyls contribute 4Ã—3=12 H. Plus the two H on the ring: 12+2=14 H. That adds up to C10H14. So each compound is a tetramethyl benzene, so each has four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring.

Now, the NMR spectrum. The aromatic region shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each integrating to 1:1 ratio. Wait, but each compound is present in 1:1 ratio. So each of the two signals corresponds to one compound, and each has a certain number of equivalent aromatic protons.

Wait, but each compound has a certain number of aromatic protons. Let's think about each option.

First, the aromatic signals. In para-disubstituted benzene rings, the protons are usually equivalent and can be a singlet if they are all the same. For example, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have symmetry. Let me think: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl would have two adjacent methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and another two
