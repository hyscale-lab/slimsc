Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, and it's asking about tautomerism and optical isomerism in two different compounds. Hmm, a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, the question mentions two parts: part A and part B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which of the given compounds will show optical isomerism.

The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A. Then for part B, it's between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Let me start with part A: which compound doesn't show tautomerism. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift in the position of a double bond. For that to happen, the compound must have a conjugated system allowing such a shift. Benzoquinoneâ€”wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. So its structure is like O=C6H4=O, but wait, no, actually, benzoquinone can have two carbonyl groups, but in a para arrangement. So, does it have any acidic protons that can lead to tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism usually occurs in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups, like in diketones. For example, in 1,2-diketones, you can have keto-enol tautomerism. So, if a compound has two carbonyl groups next to each other, it can show tautomerism. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on the benzene ring but are they adjacent? I think benzoquinone has the two carbonyl groups either in para positions (like 1,4) or maybe ortho as well. Wait, no, benzoquinone is usually 1,4-diketone. So, the carbonyls are across the ring, not adjacent.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4O, but actually, I'm getting a bit confused.
