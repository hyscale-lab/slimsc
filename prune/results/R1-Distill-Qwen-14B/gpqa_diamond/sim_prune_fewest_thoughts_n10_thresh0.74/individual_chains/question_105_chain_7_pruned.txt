Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm. The question is about a star with dark spots and how their effect on brightness compares to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The goal is to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as the spots.

First, let's parse the problem. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star = R_sun. The dark spots cover one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor, I think, refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, but wait—the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Or wait, no, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. Because the star is a sphere, so a hemisphere would be half the star's total surface area. If the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, then the total area of spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4π R²) = 0.4π R². Wait, no, wait. Let's think again.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². If the filling factor is 20%, that means 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R² is covered by spots. So the total area of spots is 0.4π R².

Now, the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star is 1000 K. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K. Wait, the problem says a temperature difference of 1000 K. So spots are cooler or hotter? Well, usually, sunspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so I'll assume the spots are 5000 K. But wait, the problem says "temperature difference of 1000K"—so it's either +1000 or -1000. But since it's dark spots, likely cooler. So spot temperature T_spot is 5000 K.

The question is about photometric variations. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing changes in brightness. But the star isn't covered by spots, so the brightness variation is due to the spots being visible as the star rotates. Alternatively, if the spots were on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible would change, hence the light curve would vary.

Wait, but the setup says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is determined by the spots, and we need to find the planet's radius that would cause the same variation.

Wait, no. The star's brightness variation due to the spots is compared to the variation caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of that dip depends on the area blocked. Similarly, the spots cause a variation as the star rotates, but here the problem states that the situation resembles an exoplanet, so the photometric variations are periodic due to rotation, similar to a planet transiting. But the question is, what exoplanet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Wait, the problem says, to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots), what would the exoplanet's radius be.

So I think we need to calculate the relative brightness variation caused by the spots and compare it to the variation caused by a planet transiting.

First, let's compute the brightness variation due to the spots. How much does the total
