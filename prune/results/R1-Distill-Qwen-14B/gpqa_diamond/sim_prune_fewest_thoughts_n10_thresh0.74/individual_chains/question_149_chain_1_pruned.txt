Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me read it carefully and think through what's going on here.

The question says that there's a small peptidic compound that's chemically synthesized. When they look at the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound, everything seems to match what's expected except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals that add up to one proton. So each is about 0.5H? Or maybe small variations but together they make 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So the mass is the same for both, but there are two separate peaks.

What does this mean? Well, the NMR and MS data are pointing towards some sort of isomerism, right? Because the molecular mass is the same, but there are two different peaks. So possible options could be enantiomers, diastereomers, or something else.

Looking at the options given:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different molecular weight. But the question says the mass is consistent with the expected, so that's probably not it. Unless the analysis is at elevated temps, but LC-MS usually can tell mass differences. So A is unlikely.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in chiral compounds, you get two peaks in chromatography because they might elute at different times. But wait, in NMR, enantiomers would show the same spectrum because they're mirror images. Unless the NMR is run in a chiral environment, but the question says the NMR is consistent except for these two peaks. So if it were enantiomers, the NMR would show a singlet for each proton. Wait, but in the NMR, these two peaks for the same alpha-proton are present. So perhaps it's not enantiomers because enantiomers would have the same NMR. So B might not fit because the NMR shows an issue.

Wait, but if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR should look the same as the pure compound because the peaks would overlap. Unless there's some diastereotopicity or something
