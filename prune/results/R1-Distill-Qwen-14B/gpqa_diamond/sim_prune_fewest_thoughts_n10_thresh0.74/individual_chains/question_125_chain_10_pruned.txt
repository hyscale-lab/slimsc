Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = ½ m ω² r², which is similar to the 3D version of the harmonic oscillator. So the force here follows Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -mω² r.

The question is asking two things: the value of the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for the same energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D, so I'll need to figure out both parts to choose the correct answer.

First, I should recall how the energy levels work for a 3D harmonic oscillator. I think in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, in 3D isotropic HO, the energy depends on the principal quantum number n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction: n = nx + ny + nz. Or wait, no, wait. I think it's that each direction has a quantum number, and the energy depends on the sum. Let me think more clearly.

In 3D, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total number of quanta, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, wait. No, no, that's not exactly right. Let me correct that. Each direction (x, y, z) contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so the total energy is the sum. So E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. So n = nx + ny + nz, and thus E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but for the harmonic oscillator in 3D, n is actually the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, but each is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So the ground state is when n=0 (nx=ny=nz=0), first excited state n=1, second n=2, third n=3, etc. So the third excited state would be n=3, because ground state is n=
