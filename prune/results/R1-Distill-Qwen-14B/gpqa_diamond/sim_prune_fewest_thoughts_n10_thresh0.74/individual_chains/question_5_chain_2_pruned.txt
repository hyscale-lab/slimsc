Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read the question carefully again.

The operator is P, a vector operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator's components are given: Px, Py, Pz. Each is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, so the operator P is actually the spin operator for a muon, right? Because the eigenvalues of spin components are ±ħ/2. So we're dealing with spin-½ particles here.

The problem is to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n must have components (nx, 0, nz), because it's in the x-z plane. So, the operator P along n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the respective directions.

But wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so the operator along n would be P·n, which is nx P_x + nz P_z. Because n is in x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so Py is not involved here.

So, the operator we need to diagonalize is P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Wait, but each of these components (Px, Py, Pz) are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So let me write those down.

Px is ħ/2 multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, Pz is ħ/2 multiplied by [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Py is [[0,-i],[i,0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So, our operator P along direction n is (nx * Px) + (nz * Pz). Plugging in the matrices, that would be:

(nx * ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (nz * ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. Let's factor out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) * [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Adding the matrices inside:

The (1,1) element is nz * 1, since nx's first row starts with 0.
The (1,2) element is nx * 1.
The (2,1) element is nx * 1.
The (2,2) element is nz*(-1).

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Hmm, so the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, but wait no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So,

( (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] ) * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no, because the eigenvalue is for the operator. Let me write it correctly.

The operator is P = (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

So, P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So, the eigenvalue equation is:

( (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] ) * |v> = (ħ/2) * |v>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] * |v> = |v>

So, the matrix equation is:

[nz, nx;
nx, -nz] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives us the eigenvalue equation where the matrix multiplied by the eigenvector equals the eigenvector times 1.

So, writing the equations:

nz * a + nx * b = a

nx * a + (-nz) * b = b

Let me rearrange the first equation:

nz a + nx b = a → (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0

Second equation:

nx a - nz b = b → nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

So, we have two equations:

1. (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0

2. nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Hmm, these are homogeneous equations. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Let me write the coefficient matrix:

[ (nz -1), nx ]

[ nx, (-nz -1) ]

The determinant is (nz -1)(-nz -1) - (nx^2) = 0

Let me compute that:

(nz -1)(-nz -1) = -(nz -1)(nz +1) = -(nz^2 -1) = -nz^2 +1.

So determinant: (-nz^2 +1) - nx^2 = 0 → 1 - nz^2 - nx^2 = 0 → but since n is a unit vector, nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So 1 - nz^2 - nx^2 = 0 → 0=0. So this holds, so the equations are dependent.

So, from equation 1: (nz -1) a + nx b = 0 → (nz -1) a = -nx b → a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b

But let's think about this. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me pick one equation. Let's take equation 1:

(nz-1) a = -nx b → a = [ -nx/(nz-1) ] b

But let me think about possible relations. Since the direction vector n is in x-z plane, let me define it in spherical coordinates. Maybe it's easier to parameterize n.

Let me parameterize the direction vector n as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) because it's in x-z plane. Wait, no, wait: the x-z plane can be parameterized as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal) is zero or π, but since n is arbitrary, perhaps we can just let n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, nx = cosθ, nz = sinθ.

Wait, no, wait. The direction vector can be represented as (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² =1.

So, let me set nx = cosθ and nz = sinθ, with θ being the angle between n and the z-axis. So, when θ=0, direction is along +z; θ=π/2, along +x.

So, substituting nx = cosθ and nz = sinθ into equation 1:

(sinθ -1) a + cosθ * b = 0

So, (sinθ -1) a = - cosθ b → a = [ - cosθ / (sinθ -1) ] b

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Let me factor denominator as -(1 - sinθ). So,

a = [ - cosθ / ( - (1 - sinθ) ) ] b = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ] b

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ) to rationalize:

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] b

Denominator becomes 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So, a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] / cos²θ * b → a = [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ] * b

So, a = (1 + sinθ) / cosθ * b.

But 1/cosθ = secθ, and (1 + sinθ)/cosθ is equal to secθ + tanθ.

Alternatively, perhaps write this as a = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ
