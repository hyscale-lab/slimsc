Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period.

So, the problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key here is the shift in spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, but how does the shift relate to the period? I think the RV method's Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K = (v) which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. Oh, right, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ ( (P) * (1 + M_p/M_*) ) ) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_*, maybe we can ignore M_p. So M_* is the mass of the star, which is the same for both planets since both stars are like the Sun.

Wait, M_p is the planet's mass. Oh, but both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So M_* is same, M_p is same. But the velocity semi-amplitude K is different for the two planets. K is inversely proportional to the orbital period, I think. Because the formula for K is something like K = ( (G * M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) * (1/P^(1/3)) ), but since M_* is much larger than M_p, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3)) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ), wait no, let me get that right.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude formula. The formula is K = ( ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ). Since the planets are in circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, since the planets have the same mass and the stars have same mass, M_p is same, M_* same, so the only variable here is the orbital period P.

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3) because let's see, K ~ (1/(P^(1/3))) ), since P is in the denominator inside the cube root. So if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, but in our case, the two K's are different. Planet #1 has K1 = 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has K2 = 7. So since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^3. Alternatively, P2 / P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let's make sure. Let's write the proportionality:

K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But M_p
