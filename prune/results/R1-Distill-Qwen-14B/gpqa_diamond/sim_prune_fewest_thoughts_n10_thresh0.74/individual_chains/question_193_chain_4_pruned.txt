Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled but let me try to figure it out. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a certain region of the sky. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, wait. So, the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance, right? Oh wait, wait. Parallax is measured in arcseconds and it's inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Or maybe it's plx = 1/(distance in parsecs). So, the distance r is, in this case, probably the same as d, which is 1/plx.

So, if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and since plx = 1/r, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Because plx is 1/r, so (plx)^5 is (1/r)^5. So 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait, that's the number of stars in the region as a function of r. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, so maybe it's the differential, like the change in N with respect to r.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential calculus. Let's say N is proportional to r^5. Then, the derivative of N with respect to r would be proportional to r^4. Because dN/dr = 5 r^4. But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. Or wait, the problem says 'how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r).' Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me read it again.

Oh, the question is about the change in the number of stars per unit range of distance. So, like, for each incremental change in r (distance), how much does the number of stars change. So that's the derivative dN/dr. Because the number of stars varies with r^5, the derivative would be 5 r^4. So
