Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. It says this acid was dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR spectra. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: a major and a minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3. 

The key part is about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Alright, let's break it down.

First, the initial reaction: dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene dehydrated to an anhydride. So dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride, which would have two carbonyl groups. The structure of the anhydride probably depends on where the cis-alkene was. Since the alkene is cis, the dehydration would form a bridge or a ring maybe? Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. In 1H NMR, a singlet at around 7 ppm is usually aromatic protons. But wait, anhydrides don't have aromatic rings unless they're cyclic, right? Wait, maybe the anhydride is cyclic. If the original acid had a cis diene, dehydrating it would form a cyclic anhydride. For example, like maleic anhydride, which is a cyclic structure with two double bondsâ€”no, wait, maleic is a five-membered ring with two ester groups. But in any case, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, which is probably from two equivalent protons in a conjugated system.

Then the 13C NMR of the anhydride has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about typical carbon shifts. 165 ppm is probably an ester carbonyl group (like in an anhydride). 137 ppm could be a carbon attached to an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen or something else. Alternatively, for a cyclopentene ring, the carbons would be around 120-140 ppm. Wait, but 137 is a bit high for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl or an sp2 carbon. Hmm.

Wait, the anhydride likely has two carbonyl groups. So maybe the 165 is the carbonyl, and 137 is another sp2 carbon, perhaps a CH that's part of a conjugated system.

So the anhydride probably has a structure with two carbonyl groups and a conjugated double bond. Maybe it's a cyclic structure, like a five-membered ring with two ester groups and a double bond.

Next, the anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Wait, that's a diene. So the reaction is probably a Diels-Alder reaction, which is between a diene and a dienophile.

Anhydrides can act as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. So the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. Let me imagine that structure. It's a cyclopentadiene (five-membered ring with two double bonds?), but wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would be a conjugated diene. The 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl substitution would mean four methyl
