Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space that absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Lyman alpha is the transition of an electron in a hydrogen atom from the second energy level to the first, which emits a photon at about 121.6 nm (which I think is 1216 Angstroms since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm). So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is indeed in the ultraviolet.

But wait, if these clouds are absorbing light at Lyman alpha, that would be absorption lines. So quasars emit light, and the hydrogen clouds in between absorb some of that light at the Lyman alpha wavelength. This is called the Lyman-alpha forest, right? And this is commonly seen in quasar spectra, where you see lots of absorption lines blueward (at shorter wavelengths) of the quasar's own emission lines.

Now, the question is about the redshift. Redshift (z) tells us how much the wavelength of the light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. So if an object is moving away (or the universe expands while the light travels), the wavelength increases. The formula I remember is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z).

But wait, in the case of absorption lines, the absorption occurs at the rest wavelength of the hydrogen, which is 1216 Angstroms. So if the cloud is at a redshift z, the wavelength we observe the absorption line would be 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

But the question is about detecting these clouds using optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes typically observe in the range of about 400 nm (violet) to
