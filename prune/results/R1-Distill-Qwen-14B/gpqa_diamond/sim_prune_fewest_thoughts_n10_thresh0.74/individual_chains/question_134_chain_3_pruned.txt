Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve an acid and a base reacting to form water and a salt. But wait, there are three solutions here. So I need to figure out which ones are reacting with each other.

Wait, HCl and H2SO4 are acids, right? And Ba(OH)2 is a base. So maybe the acids are reacting with the base. But I should think about how much of each acid and base is present.

First, I should calculate the moles of H+ from each acid. For HCl, which is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+. So moles of HCl = Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters). HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and since it's diprotic, each mole contributes 2 H+ ions. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Adding them together, total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ reacts with OH- in a 1:1 ratio. So the available H+ is 0.28 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles. So which is the limiting reactant here?

The OH- is 0.2, which is less than 0.28, so OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left.

So the amount of neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but what about the enthalpy of neutralization? I remember that the enthalpy change for neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ reacting. For strong acids and bases, the enthalpy is around -57 kJ/mol, but sometimes the value is taken as -100 kJ/mol? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, no, I think for each mole of H+ neutralized, the enthalpy
