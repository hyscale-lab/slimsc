Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they have chiral centers, meaning the molecule isn't symmetrical enough to have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. 

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which ones can show optical isomerism. Let's take each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, what's that structure like? Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring, I think. So, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester group. Since the ester groups are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and the nitro groups are at 6 and 6', the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are symmetrical, then maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but wait. If the substituents are in the same positions on each ring, does that create a plane of symmetry? Because if the two rings are mirror images of each other, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement is such that the molecule doesn't have a symmetry plane, then it might be chiral. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. If the substituents are on both rings at positions that are across from each other, maybe there's a plane of symmetry down the middle. So, if you have a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2 on each ring, and the rings are connected, would that allow a plane of symmetry? Alternatively, if the arrangement is such that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral. I'm not too sure. Maybe I should move on and come back to this one.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is OCH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester form. So the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3, with methyl as the ester group. Does that molecule have a chiral center? Let's see: the carbon chain is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate structure: the propanoate would be CH2-COOCH3, and the 2-hydroxy would be on the adjacent carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure
