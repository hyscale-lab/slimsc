Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to solve. Let me read it again and try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data includes their radii, masses, the wavelengths where they appear brightest, and their radial velocities. The task is to find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Let me jot down the given information:

- Radius of Star_1 (R1) = 1.5 * R2 (where R2 is Star_2's radius)
- Mass of Star_1 (M1) = 1.5 * M2
- Wavelengths where they appear brightest (λ1 = λ2)
- Radial velocities: Star_1 is 0 km/s, Star_2 is 700 km/s
- Compute L1 / L2 ratio.

Hmm. So they want the factor by which L1 is greater than L2. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. But since we're dealing with ratios, I can ignore the constants.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, that part is straightforward. So R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor from radius is 2.25.

Now, the tricky part is finding the temperature ratio, T1/T2. The stars appear to have the same wavelengths at which they are brightest. Wait, what does that mean? Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). 

So if λ1 = λ2, then their temperatures must be the same? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think. Because if λ_max is the same, then T1 = T2. Because from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, T must be same. So T1 = T2?

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ1 = λ2. So according to Wien's law, λ_max = b / T. So if λ_max is same, then T1 = T2. So the temperature ratio T1/T2 is 1. So the luminosity ratio would just be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer would be option A or D?

Wait, but wait, no. Because the radial velocities are given. Oh, right! The radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, the wavelengths we observe are shifted. 

So, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. But Star_2 has a
