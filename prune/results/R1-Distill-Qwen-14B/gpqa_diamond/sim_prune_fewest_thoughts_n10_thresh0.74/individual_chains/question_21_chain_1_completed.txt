Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, I remember that the question is about isomers and some specific properties like tautomerism and optical isomerism. So let me break it down step by step.

First, the question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different structures, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that, the compound must have both an acidic hydrogen (like alpha to a carbonyl) and a suitable site to accept the lone pair.

Benzoquinone—benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic di-ketone. So, maybe it's similar to benzene with two ketone groups. But wait, more specifically, benzoquinone can be 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone. Either way, the structure has two ketone groups attached to the benzene ring. Do they have alpha hydrogens? Let me think. The carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons of the benzene. The alpha carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl) would be the ones attached to the ring. But in a benzene ring, each carbon is part of the ring, so maybe the carbonyl groups are on carbons that are each connected to two other ring carbons. So the alpha positions are the ring carbons. Wait, but those are part of the aromatic ring, so maybe they don't have hydrogens attached. Or wait, maybe they do. Wait, no, in the case of benzoquinone, the carbonyl is on the benzene ring, so the structure is like O=C6H4-C=O (but in the correct positions). So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are the ones in the ring. Do those have hydrogens? Well, for example, looking at benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen when it's mono-substituted, but when it's substituted with a carbonyl, like in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons (ortho and para) would have hydrogens. Wait, but wait: the carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons in 1,2-benzoquinone. So each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's connected to another ring carbon. So those positions (like the carbon next to the carbonyl) would have hydrogens? Hmm.

If benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, then it can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but tautomerism usually requires a conjugated system. Let me think about an example. For example, cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, but if the ring is rigid, maybe it's less likely. But benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Wait, but wait, if they are in positions where the alpha hydrogens are present, then it can tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens because the carbonyl group is directly attached to the benzene ring, which is aromatic. So the carbonyl is at a position where the adjacent carbons are part of the ring, and perhaps don't have hydrogens. Wait, no. Wait, the benzene ring in benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups opposite each other. So each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's connected to two other carbons in the ring. So for 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So the carbons next to the carbonyl are each connected to two ring carbons and a hydrogen. For example, the structure is O=C6H4-C=O, but that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring where two opposite (para) positions have carbonyl groups. So each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is bonded to two other carbons in the ring and one hydrogen. So, each of those carbonyl carbons is attached to a CH. So, that would mean that each carbonyl has an alpha hydrogen. Therefore, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but wait: in the case of benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are conjugated through the ring. So, if the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, it would form an enol form. But because the ring is aromatic, maybe the enol form would disrupt the aromaticity. Hmmm. That's a good point. Benzene is aromatic, and if you form an enol, you'd have a conjugated dienol, which might not be possible because that would create a non-aromatic structure. Alternatively, maybe the tautomerism isn't possible because the enol form would not be stable. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. So, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2- and then connected in a ring. Wait, no, the numbering is 1,3,5, so each is separated by a single carbon. So each of those carbonyls is attached to a CH2 group. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha carbons) are CH2 groups. So they have two hydrogens each. So, those alpha hydrogens can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the tautomerism is not possible because there's no suitable position for the hydrogen shift. Or maybe it can.

Wait, for tautomerism, the molecule needs to have an H on the alpha carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each alpha carbon (the ones next to the carbonyl) is a CH2 group. So each has two hydrogens. But can these hydrogens shift to form an enol? Wait, in a six-membered ring, the positions are 1,3,5, so each carbonyl is in a position that's across from each other. So each alpha carbon is a methylene group (CH2). So, if one of the alpha hydrogens shifts, maybe it could form an enol. But wait, in a ketone, the keto-enol tautomerism is possible when there's a lone pair available and when the structure allows for conjugation. But in a cyclic trione, would that be possible? Let me think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Each carbonyl is at 1,3,5, so the ring is symmetric. Each alpha carbon is a CH2.

So, if a hydrogen from the CH2 next to a carbonyl moves to the carbonyl oxygen, forming an enol. But wait, the ring would have to accommodate that. Let's imagine: each carbonyl is at 1,3,5. So, the ring alternates between carbonyl and CH2 groups. So, each CH2 is between two carbonyls. So, each CH2 is flanked by carbonyls. So, each alpha carbon is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Wait, that's a key point. Because each alpha carbon is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, maybe this promotes keto-enol tautomerism. So, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism, while benzoquinone doesn't.

Wait, but earlier I thought benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because the enol form would interfere with aromaticity. Let me think again. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4-C=O. So if it tautomerizes, perhaps the H from the alpha C (attached to the carbonyl) moves to the oxygen, resulting in an enol structure. But that would create a ring with conjugated double bonds, perhaps disrupting the aromaticity. So, the enol form would be less stable, making tautomerism unlikely. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. So the compound that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says, among the two compounds, which one does NOT show tautomerism. So, the question is, which one is the one that doesn't show tautomerism?

If benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does, then A is benzoquinone. So in the options, part A is either benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

So part A is about which compound doesn't tautomerize. So, if benzoquinone doesn't, then A is benzoquinone.

Now, part B: among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

Wait, optical isomerism (also known as enantiomerism) occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. So, the compounds need to have a carbon with four different substituents.

First, let's analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Its structure is: the ester group is OMe (methyl), the propanoate part is CH2-COOH, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COO−, but as an ester, it's OMe. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. As an ester, it would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the structure is CH3CHOHCOOCH3.

Wait, but wait, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon chain is: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The middle carbon (the one attached to OH and COOCH3) is the second carbon. So, looking at that middle carbon: what substituents does it have? The groups attached are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH (from the chain). So, wait, the substituents are:

- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen? Or wait, no, wait. Let me draw it:

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is the second carbon. Let's see: for the second carbon:

- It's connected to:

1. A CH3 group (from the first carbon),
2. An OH group,
3. A COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),
4. And a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH), so the structure is CH2 groups on either side? No, wait: Wait, wait. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon is bonded to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH (top),
- COOCH3 (right),
- and a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH), not C(OH)).

Wait, but wait, that would make the second carbon have four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So all four are different? Let's see: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Are any of these the same? No. CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H are all distinct. Therefore, that carbon is a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. It's a trans-dicarboxylic acid. So, dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. Structure: O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait no, that's not correct. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, that's maleic acid. No, wait, maleic acid is HO2CCHCH2CO2H, but that's the cis isomer. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so HO2CCH=CHCO2H.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, actually, no. The correct structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3, but no, that's not right. Wait, no: the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is CH2=CH, but each CH is connected to a COOCH3 group. So, (E)-CH2(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3) would be wrong because the double bond is between the two CHs. So the structure is CH2=CH, but each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, no, no. Let me think about fumaric acid correctly. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait: No, that's not correct. Fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, right? So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for maleic acid (cis), and HOOC-CH=CH-COOH for fumaric acid (trans). So, dimethyl fumarate would have two ester groups: OMe instead of OH on the COOH groups. So, the structure is OMeOOC-CH=CH-COOOCH3. Wait, but in the molecule, the double bond is between the two CH groups, each connected to a COOCH3.

So, the molecule is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, wait: Each end of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? No, no. Let's correct that. Each of the two carbons in the double bond (the central CH=CH) is connected to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group from the ester? No, wait. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3

 attached to a carbon that is part of a double bond. So, the structure would be O=C-OCH3 attached to each of the two carbons in the double bond. So, the molecule is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Wait, but that would mean each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH2? No, perhaps it's more accurately:

The structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3, but that's not right because that would imply a single bond. Wait, no, it's CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. So each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group? No, wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2(COOCH3))–CH2–, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, the structure can be written as CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that would be if each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group. Wait, perhaps it's (COOCH3)2C=CH2, but that's not right either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

The key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Fumaric acid, in its (E) configuration, has a plane of symmetry. Because the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but the molecule itself is symmetrical. When you esterify both COOH groups into COOCH3, you end up with a symmetrical molecule. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester, which has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral, meaning it does not have a chiral center and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure again. If each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group attached, would that make the molecule symmetrical? For example, in the (E) configuration, the two COOCH3 groups would be on opposite sides of the double bond. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't show optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism. Therefore, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The middle carbon (CH(OH)) has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So yes, that's a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism.

So, part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Putting it all together: A is the compound that does not show tautomerism, which is benzoquinone. B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So option B would be the correct choice.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the properties of the compounds in parts (A) and (B):

### Part (A): Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen atom and a lone pair of electrons between two atoms, resulting in different structural isomers (e.g., keto-enol tautomerism). For this to happen, the compound must have an acidic hydrogen (e.g., alpha to a carbonyl group) and a suitable site to accept the lone pair.

1. **Benzoquinone**: Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha carbons) are part of the aromatic ring. These alpha carbons do not have hydrogens because they are fully conjugated in the aromatic system. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is not possible. Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups in a six-membered ring, with alpha carbons (CH₂ groups) adjacent to each carbonyl. These alpha carbons have hydrogens that can participate in keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.

From this, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part (B): Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. 

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)=CH(COOCH₃). The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the (E)-configuration of the double bond, making it achiral. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from parts (A) and (B), the correct option is:

- **A = benzoquinone**
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

ANSWER: B
