Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to work through it. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I need to understand what's happening here. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, which is a base. When we add a strong acid to it, they should react. The acid will donate H+ ions, and the base will donate OH- ions. The reaction between a strong acid and a hydroxide would typically produce water and the corresponding salt.

So the reaction equation should be something like Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O. Wait, more accurately, since Fe(OH)3 is a base, it will react with H+ ions from the acid. Each molecule of Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, right? So the reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

That makes sense because each OH- from Fe(OH)3 would react with an H+ from the acid. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need three moles of H+.

Now, the problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I should calculate how many moles that is. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)) → 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation: 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.00093598, so 9.36e-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid used is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule, like HCl. So the volume of acid needed can be found using the formula: moles = Molarity * Volume → Volume = moles / Molarity.

So Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L → 28.08 cm³. Wait, 0.02808 liters is 28.08 milliliters, which is 28.08 cm³ because 1 cm³ is 1 mL.

Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³. Hmm, that's very close. So maybe that's the correct volume needed.

But wait, the question asks for the minimum volume of the acid. Did I do that right? Oh, because each Fe(OH)3 requires 3 H+ ions, so I think I did that correctly.

Now, about the pH of the resulting solution. After dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions and some excess H+ from the acid, right? Because Fe(OH)3 is only a base, but the acid is in excess, or perhaps exactly the needed amount?

Wait, no. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but the acid is strong. So when the acid is just enough to react with all the Fe(OH)
