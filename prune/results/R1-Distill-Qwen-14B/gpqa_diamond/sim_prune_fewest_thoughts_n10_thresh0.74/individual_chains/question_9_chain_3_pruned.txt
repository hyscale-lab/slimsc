Okay, so I've got this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h is a type of symmetry in molecules, right? It's one of the point groups in molecular symmetry. So C3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane, I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh, right, C3h is a group that includes a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). So the molecule should have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two others with long names. Let's list them out.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Option C: triisopropyl borate.

Option D: quinuclidine.

I need to figure out which of these has C3h symmetry.

Let me think about each option.

First, triisopropyl borate. Structure-wise, I think it's something like (i-Pr)3BO. The structure of triisopropyl borate: each isopropyl group is attached
