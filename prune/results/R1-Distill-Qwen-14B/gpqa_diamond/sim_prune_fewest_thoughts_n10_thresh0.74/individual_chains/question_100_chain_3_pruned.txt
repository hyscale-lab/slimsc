Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, what's that? C3H6 has a degree of unsaturation. Let me calculate that. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, (2*3 +2 -6)/2 = (8-6)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. So possible structures: propene (propylene), or cyclopropane. But more likely propene since it's a common starting material.

So Compound A is propene, C3H6. Then it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, I remember that when alkenes react with bromine (Br2) in CCl4, it's a diaddition. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add bromine across the double bond, making dibromide. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Let me think. When propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with Br2, it adds across the double bond. So the structure becomes BrCH2-CHBr-CH3? Wait, that's 1,2-dibromopropane. So yes, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Oh, that's an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent bromines) are treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. So the dihalide would lose HBr from adjacent carbons. So in this case, 1,2-dibromopropane would lose two HBr molecules to form propene again? Wait, but wait, the dihalide is 1,2-dibromopropane, so elimination would form either 1-propene
