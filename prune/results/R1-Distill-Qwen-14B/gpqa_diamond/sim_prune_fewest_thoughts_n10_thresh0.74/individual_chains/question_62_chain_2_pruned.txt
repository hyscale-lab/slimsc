Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out what the structure of the target molecule looks like. The IUPAC name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Then, at the 1-position (which would be adjacent to the aldehyde), there's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl—so that's like CH2OH attached to a cyclohexane ring, right? So, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group on one carbon, and on the adjacent carbon, a CH2-OH group which is also connected to another cyclohexane ring. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me sketch it out.

Wait, no. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that would be a methyl group (CH2-) where one hydrogen is replaced by an -OH group, and the other is connected to a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So the target molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the adjacent carbon.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached to another carbon). So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so it's cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached. Or wait, wait, ethynyl is -C≡C- group. Wait,
