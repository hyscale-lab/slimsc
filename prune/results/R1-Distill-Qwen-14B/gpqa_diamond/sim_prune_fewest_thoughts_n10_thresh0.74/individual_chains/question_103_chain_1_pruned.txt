Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I need to visualize the target molecule. The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which means there's a ketone group (ethan-1-one) attached to a benzene ring. The substituents on the benzene are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would go such that positions 3 and 5 are adjacent in a meta arrangement. Let me draw that: the benzene ring has a ketone (maybe at position 1), a bromine at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is attached as a substituent on the benzene, making it a phenyl ketone.

Wait, the structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So ethan-1-one is acetone, which is (propan-2-one?), but in this case, the acetone is attached via the carbonyl carbon to the benzene. So the structure would be:

Ph-C(=O)-CH3, where Ph is the benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5: Br and NO2. So the benzene has substituents at ortho and para positions relative to the ketone group, I think. Wait, actually, the ketone is attached to the benzene at one position, say position 1, and then the bromo is at position 3 and nitro at 5. So positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2) would be the substituents. So the ring has three substituents: the ketone (as a substituent), Br, and NO2.

Wait, benzene can't have substituents at
