Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me try to understand what the given data is and how to approach this.

First, the problem states that each star has a certain mass compared to the Sun. Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2. But wait, I think the mass might not directly affect the abundance ratio here because the question is about the photospheric composition. Maybe the mass is a red herring or perhaps it's needed for something else, but I'm not sure yet. I'll keep that in mind.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW (equivalent width) method, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The values provided are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is higher than the Sun by 0.3 dex.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So, magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is higher than the Sun by 0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So, the iron abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Magnesium to hydrogen in Star_2 is same as the Sun.

I think I need to calculate the [Si/H] for both stars and then find the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given. For the Sun:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that correctly.

Wait, nFe/nH: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log
