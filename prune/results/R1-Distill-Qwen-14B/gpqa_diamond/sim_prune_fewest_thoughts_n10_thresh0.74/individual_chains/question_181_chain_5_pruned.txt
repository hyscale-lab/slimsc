Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops. Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? Oh right, the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-III branch involves triple-alpha reactions, but I think it's not the main contributor. Oh wait, no, the main proton-proton chain is the pp-I branch, right? The pp-III is maybe a minor part.

So if the pp-III suddenly stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? The question is about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the neutrino production changes when pp-III stops.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in different processes. The most common solar neutrinos come from the pp-I branch. The pp-I produces a lot of neutrinos through the decay of beryllium-7, I think. But wait, the pp-III branch... does that produce different types or energies of neutrinos?

I remember that the pp-III branch isn't a major part of the Sun's energy production, but maybe it's responsible for some specific neutrinos. Oh right, the pep (proton-electron
