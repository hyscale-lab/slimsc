Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by the process gamma-gamma → e+ e-. So, basically, when a high-energy gamma-ray interacts with a CMB photon, they produce an electron-positron pair. This interaction would limit how long these gamma-rays can exist in the universe before annihilating. 

I remember that the CMB has a certain average photon energy. The problem states it's 10^-3 eV. So those are low-energy photons, microwave background stuff.

I think this has to do with photon-photon interactions. The cross-section for this process must be relevant. But wait, the cross-section for two photons annihilating into electron-positron pairs depends on their energies. There's probably a threshold energy involved because you need enough energy to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair.

The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV each, so together it's 1.022 MeV. So, the center-of-mass energy of the two photons needs to be at least this. But wait, the problem is about a gamma-ray and a CMB photon. So, the gamma-ray has high energy E, and the CMB photon has low energy, say E_cm is the energy in the center of mass frame.

So, the condition is that the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2*0.511 MeV, right? Or wait, actually, each photon's energy doesn't need to be that high because in the CoM frame, their energies add up. So, for the process to be possible, the total energy in the CoM frame should be at least 2m_e c².

But wait, the gamma and the CMB photon are moving in opposite directions, I think. Because for pair production, the photons need to have sufficient energy when combined. So, the energy squared would be (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2, assuming they're moving in opposite directions. Since the CMB photon is low energy, E2 is much smaller than E1, but wait, let me make it precise.

Let's
