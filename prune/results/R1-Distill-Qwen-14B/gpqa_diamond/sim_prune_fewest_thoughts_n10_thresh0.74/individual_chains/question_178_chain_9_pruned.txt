Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I think I remember that renormalizability has to do with the dimensions of the coupling constants and the terms in the Lagrangian. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I think are the commutators of the gamma matrices. So, σ_{μν} must be an antisymmetric tensor of some sort, maybe related to the spinor representation.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must be dimensionless because the action is dimensionless. So each term's mass dimension must be zero. The Lagrangian density has dimensions of [Mass]^4, because when you integrate it over four dimensions, the action is dimensionless.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because when you multiply by d^4x (mass^-4), the action (integral of L d^4x) is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So, the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} must have mass dimension 4. Let's find the dimensions of each part.

The ψ is a Dirac spinor. Dirac spinors have mass dimension 3/2. Because, in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is (i γ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0, and the derivative has dimension 1, so ψ must have dimension 3/2 to balance the equation. So, ψ̄ is also 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices. Each γ^μ has mass dimension 1, so their commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] also has dimension 2. Then, σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which doesn't change the dimension because the numerical factor doesn't affect it. So σ has dimension 2.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. F is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. Each derivative is dimension 1. F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Wait, each A has dimension 1 because the field strength F has dimension 2 (since it's ∂A, derivative is dimension 1, A is dimension 1, so F is 2).

Wait, wait. Let me double-check: the gauge field A^μ has mass dimension 1. Because the field strength F^μν is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Since each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, F has dimension 2.

So, putting it all together, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F.

So, the dimensions are: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 2, ψ is 3/2, and F is 2.

Wait, wait, no. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, so the product would be ψ̄ (dim 3/2) * σ (dim 2) * ψ (dim 3/2) * F (dim 2). Multiplying their dimensions:

3/2 * 2 * 3/2 * 2 = Let me compute that. 3/2 *2 is 3, then 3 *3/
