Alright, I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different pairs of compounds, and I need to figure out which pair is correct.

Hmm, first, I should recall what these types of NMR signals indicate. Let's break it down.

The aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) has two singlets. Aromatic protons can be split into different environments based on their substitution patterns. A singlet means no neighboring protons, so the protons are equivalent and not adjacent to any others. Wait, but in aromatic rings, each proton is next to two others unless in a para position perhaps. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: in monosubstituted benzene, the protons are ortho, meta, para. Ortho would have two adjacent Hs, meta maybe only one, but in disubstituted rings, things get more complicated.

Wait, but wait. The compounds in the options are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes diethylbenzene. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Option C: 1,2,3,5 and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the molecular formula for each. C10H14.

For tetramethylbenzenes, each methyl is CH3. Benzene has 6 C. So four methyls add 4*1=4 C, total 10. So each is C10H14? Wait, benzene is C
