Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, but at higher dimension. So the operators are classified based on the SM gauge symmetry, like SU(3), SU(2), U(1), and also other symmetries like Lorentz.

Lorentz symmetry is fundamental in relativity. So all terms in the Lagrangian must respect Lorentz symmetry. That means the operators should be Lorentz scalars. So option 1 (Lorentz) is definitely a must.

Then Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. But wait, in effective field theories, you usually don't have strict Poincare symmetry because the theory is valid up to a cutoff. Or wait, maybe I'm confusing this. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it incorporates all symmetries of the underlying theory. The underlying SM has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT should respect it as well. But wait, operators in SMEFT can have higher derivatives, but those are still compatible with Poincare? Or do higher derivative terms break Poincare? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, I think that the SMEFT is constructed to maintain the same symmetries as the SM, so Poincare must be respected. So option 2 (Poincare) is also a must. So that makes options 1 and 2, which is the first part.

Wait, but wait... the SM does have Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT as an effective theory should also respect it. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are maintained.

Wait, but in SMEFT, operators are invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz, but do they have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translation invariance. Do the SMEFT operators require terms to be translation invariant? Well, the Lagrangian in EFT is local, so terms
