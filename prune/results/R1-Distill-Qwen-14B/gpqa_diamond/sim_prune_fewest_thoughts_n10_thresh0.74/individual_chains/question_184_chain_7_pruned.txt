Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to get the desired compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me break it down and see how each step should go.

Alright, starting with benzene. I remember that benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions. The substituents I need to add are a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. But the order is important because each substituent can direct the next reaction either ortho/para or meta.

Let me think about the substituents:
- tert-Butyl is a bulky alkyl group, which is a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl chain). It's ortho/para directing.
- Ethoxy (OCH2CH3) is an activating group too, but it's more strongly activating than alkyl groups because it's an ether. It's ortho/para directing as well.
- Nitro (NO2) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

The target structure is 2-(tert-butyl), which is para to the ethoxy group (since numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3: ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3). Wait, let me visualize the benzene ring. Let's number the substituents as follows: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2 (which is ortho to ethoxy), and nitro at position 3 (which is meta to ethoxy and para to tert-butyl). Hmm, maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Wait, benzene is a ring with six carbons. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl. Then position 3 would be adjacent to position 2. So, where's the nitro group? It's on position 3, which is meta to nitro, but I need to see how each substituent affects the next.

The strategy here is to plan the order of adding the substituents so that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

Let me consider the directing effects. Since nitro is meta-direct
