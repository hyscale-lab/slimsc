Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbonyl aldehyde group all attached to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, let me double-check. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane ring has three substituents at position 1: a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and a formyl group (CHO). Wait, no, actually, the name might imply a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexane has a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group, and another substituent as the aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the cyclohexane ring has a substituent that's a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group, and also has an aldehyde group. Hmm, maybe I should try to draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a methyl group attached at position 1. That methyl is further substituted with a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Also, the same cyclohexane ring has an aldehyde group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) and an aldehyde group (CHO), and also a cyclohexyl group attached. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group, meaning a methyl group connected to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane (so a cyclohexylmethyl group), and the methyl has an OH group. So the substituent is a cyclohexyl(CH2OH) group attached to the main cyclohexane. And also, the main ring has a formyl group (CHO) at the same carbon? Or perhaps the formyl is on another carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (say, position 1) is connected to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and a formyl group (CHO). That would mean that the carbon at position 1 has three substituents: cyclohexyl, CH2OH, and CHO. But in reality, that might not be possible because a carbon can't have more than four bonds. Oh wait, perhaps it's a branching point; the carbon is connected to the cyclohexane ring, the cyclohexyl group, the CH2OH, and the CHO. Hmm, that's four substituents, which would be a quaternary carbon. That's possible.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps instead. So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about what each reagent does.

Looking at the options, the first step in each option involves NaNH2 and some chloride or alcohol. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, especially in elimination reactions or to form strong bases like amide ions. For example, in the presence of a methyl chloride, perhaps it's for an alkylation. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's used in a Birch reduction or some kind of elimination.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. If I treat it with NaNH2 and a methyl chloride, perhaps it's an alkylation. NaNH2 would deprotonate something, maybe a hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond to form a lithium or sodium amide. Alternatively, in the presence of a methyl chloride, perhaps it's a Grignard-like alkylation. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base but not a Grignard reagent. Wait, but maybe it's the formation of a cyclohexenide or some kind of ring expansion.

Alternatively, if I have ethynylcyclohexane and add a strong base like NaNH2, maybe it's a deprotonation to form a cyclohexenide. Then, methyl chloride would alkylate the cyclohexenide. Wait, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the cyclohexenide would attack the methyl chloride, leading to alkylation.

But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2CH2C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane? No, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

If I treat this with NaNH2, maybe it deprotonates the terminal alkyne. Wait, terminal alkynes are acidic with pKa around 25, so NaNH2 (which is a stronger base, pKa of conjugate acid around 38) can deprotonate them. So, the triple bond becomes a -C≡C- with a negative charge on the terminal carbon. Then, methyl chloride would methylate that carbon, adding a methyl group. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, the structure after alkylation would be CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane is CH2CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

When you deprotonate the terminal alkyne (the H on the C≡CH), you get a cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^-Na^+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate that, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. So now, the triple bond becomes a single bond with two methyl groups attached. Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2CH2-C≡CH, so after alkylation, it becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane? Wait, no, the triple bond is between the two carbons. So after deprotonation and alkylation, the triple bond becomes a single bond with a methyl group. So the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, no, that's not possible because the triple bond is between two carbons. So if I add a methyl group to the triple bond, I'd get a substitution on the triple bond, making it a single bond with two methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a vinyl group: CH2-C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH.

When we deprotonate the C≡CH end with NaNH2, we get a cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C^- Na^+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react with that, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond is still present, but now the terminal carbon has a methyl group. But wait, that would give a tetrahedral geometry, but triple bonds are linear. So perhaps this is a substitution on the sp-hybridized carbon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the NaNH2 and methyl chloride aren't for alkylation but for some other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to form a cyclohexylmethyl group.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group and a formyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, then reducing it, or maybe introducing the formyl group via oxidation.

Wait, another thought: The target has an aldehyde group. To form an aldehyde, perhaps oxidation of a primary alcohol is needed. Alternatively, maybe it's formed via a formylation reaction, like the Gattermann–Koch reaction or something else.

Hmm. Let's think about the reagents. Looking at the options, option C has steps: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2. Option D has NaNH2 and methanol as step 1.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonating and methylating the triple bond. Let's say we have ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. The triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3, but that's not possible because the triple bond can't have two substituents like that. Wait, no, perhaps it's a substitution. So, the triple bond CH2-C≡CH becomes CH2-C≡C- after deprotonation, then methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the carbon, making CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's an alkyne with two methyl groups. But that would require the sp-hybridized carbon to have two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is in such a way that the alkyne is converted into a ketone. Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the overall synthesis. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, we need to form a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group and an aldehyde.

Perhaps the steps involve:

1. Alkyne functionalization: Adding a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond.

2. Reduction of the triple bond to a single bond (alkane) or a double bond (alkene).

3. Introducing a hydroxyl group via ozonolysis or some other cleavage.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the first step adds a substituent to the alkyne, then the alkyne is hydrogenated, and then some cleavage occurs.

Let me consider each option.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Maybe this is alkyne alkylation, adding a methyl group to the triple bond.

Step 2: H2 with Pd catalyst. That would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So if the triple bond was CH2-C≡CH, after step 1, it becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3, and after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Hydrogenation of a triple bond would add two hydrogens across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-C-C-CH3, but wait, that's just a single bond, but perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. After alkylation, it becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Then, hydrogenation would convert the triple bond into a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that's not possible). Wait, no, the structure after alkylation is CH2-C≡C-CH3; hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would be a single bond, but the actual product would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps hydrogenation of the triple bond would give CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but I'm not following. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is between two carbons. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. After alkylation with methyl chloride, it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add two hydrogens across the triple bond, converting it into a single bond. But that's not possible because a triple bond can be hydrogenated to a double bond first and then to a single bond. Wait, but H2 with Pd would typically hydrogenate a triple bond all the way to a single bond, right? So CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-C-CH2-CH3, but that's just a single bond, so the molecule becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that doesn't make sense because that's just a longer chain. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation step is reducing the triple bond to a double bond. Wait, if the reagent is H2 and Pd, but perhaps it's Lindlar's catalyst or something else to control the hydrogenation. But the options don't specify; the option just says H2/Pd.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation is done under specific conditions. So, after alkylation, the triple bond is now -C≡C- with two methyl groups? No, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making it CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add Hs across the triple bond, making it a single bond, so the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is butane attached to cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem helpful for making the target molecule.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let's look at option C: step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S, and step 4 is Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it. So maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation that reduces a triple bond to a double bond, but that's not how hydrogenation usually works. Wait, hydrogenation typically reduces triple bonds to single bonds. Unless it's partial hydrogenation, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps after the alkylation, the triple bond is converted into a single bond, and then further steps add functional groups.

Wait, maybe the target molecule requires a cyclohexylmethyl group with a hydroxyl and an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, thinking about the target molecule, perhaps there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a cyclohexylmethyl group, which has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylate to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate to make a diol or a diol derivative.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about each option's steps.

Looking at option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, methanol is CH3OH. So maybe that's an alkylation, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Alternatively, maybe it's for deprotonation, and then methanol acts as an electrophile. But how?

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a formyl group (CHO). To form an aldehyde, perhaps a formylation reaction is involved, like using a formyl chloride or via oxidation of a primary alcohol.

But in the options, I don't see any formyl chloride; perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of an alcohol.

Wait, looking at the steps in option C: after ozonolysis (which breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups), and then Ba(OH)2, which could be for elimination or oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to reduce the triple bond to a single bond, perhaps creating a cyclohexylmethyl group.

3. Ozonolysis of a double bond (but where would the double bond come from?) Wait, maybe I'm missing a step. Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, an elimination occurs to form a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, perhaps after step 2 in option C, the molecule has a double bond, which is then cleaved in step 3 with ozone to form carbonyl groups.

But how would step 2 create a double bond? If step 2 is H2 and Pd, that would hydrogenate a triple bond to a single bond, but perhaps under certain conditions, like using a poisoned catalyst, it could stop at the double bond. But the question says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which I think is for full hydrogenation to single bonds.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the first step in option C is alkylation of the triple bond with methyl chloride, giving a longer alkyne. Then, hydrogenation reduces it to a single bond (so ethane chain becomes longer). Then, ozonolysis would require a double bond, so this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: The target molecule has a hydroxymethyl group. Perhaps that comes from a Grignard reaction or an epoxide opening, but I'm not seeing that in the steps.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Reduction of the alkyne to a cis-diol (but that would require something like hydrogenation with a specific catalyst, like Na in NH3, but that's not in the options).

Alternatively, perhaps after the alkylation, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, creating a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation in step 2 is to reduce the alkyne to an alkane, but that doesn't help in creating functional groups. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is to form a cyclohexylmethyl group.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Then, hydrogenation would make it CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Another approach: Maybe the target molecule requires the introduction of an aldehyde group via oxidation. The steps in option C have O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up for ozonolysis, leading to aldehyde groups.

So, let's imagine the molecule after step 2 has a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps in step 1, the alkyne is alkylated, then in step 2, hydrogenated to a trans-alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but how would step 2 create a double bond? Because H2 with Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds all the way to single bonds.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about another option.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

So step 1: Alkylation with ethyl chloride. Maybe making a longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used for elimination or for deprotonating to form a carbanion. Or perhaps it's for Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: Ozonolysis in water, which would give carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, maybe for reductive work-up.

But I'm not sure how that would lead to the target molecule.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe methanol is acting as an electrophile. So, NaNH2 deprotonates something, then methanol adds a methyl group. But where?

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and methanol. Perhaps deprotonation of the alkyne, then OMe- adds as a methyl group. So the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense because the alkyne would have a negative charge, and methanol would donate a methyl group via SN2 perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 and methanol are for a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible transformations.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps one of the steps forms a carbonyl group via oxidation or ozonolysis.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: Alkylation of the alkyne with methyl chloride, making a longer alkyne.

Step 2: Hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, turning the alkyne into a single bond (so the triple bond becomes a single bond, adding two Hs). So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane? But that doesn't seem helpful for forming the target.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the positions correctly. Maybe the alkylation adds a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond, making the structure CH2-C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane? No, the starting molecule is ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. So after alkylation, it would be CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Then, hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. But that's just a longer chain without any functional groups.

Wait, perhaps after that, step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. But if the molecule is a single bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond all the way. Maybe it's a partial hydrogenation to a double bond. But I thought H2 with Pd typically goes all the way.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenolysis, breaking the triple bond into a single bond but adding hydrogens.

Wait, then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S (which is a reductive work-up, leading to aldehydes or ketones, depending on the starting double bond).

But if after step 2, the molecule has a single bond, then ozonolysis wouldn't work. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm considering the wrong initial steps. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH and a CHO. So perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a diol, which is then oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, which is then cleaved. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH and a CHO. So, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation, then reduced to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cis-diol via hydrogenation with a specific catalyst, then the diol is oxidized.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via a hydroxylation reaction, then further processed.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which sequence could lead to the target.

Let's consider option C again:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → Alkyne alkylation adds a methyl group.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond.

So, the molecule becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No functional groups yet.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the molecule now has a single bond. So this step doesn't make sense. Therefore, option C might not be correct.

What about option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → Maybe this is a deprotonation and O-methylation. But I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li/liquid NH3 → This is a strong base, often used for elimination reactions or for deprotonation in alkyne chemistry to form carbanions.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → Ozonolysis, which would cleave a double bond.

Step 4: NH4OH → This is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for work-up after ozonolysis.

But I'm not seeing how this would form the target molecule.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → Alkyne alkylation with ethyl group.

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 → Strong base, maybe elimination to form a triple bond again? Or maybe for a Birch reduction.

Step 3: O3/H2O → Ozonolysis in water, which would give carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → Work-up.

Again, not sure how this leads to the target.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → Alkylation.

Step 2: H2/Pd → Hydrogenation.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → Maybe a strong base for elimination or epoxide opening.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Oxidation conditions, possibly for dehydration or oxidation of alcohols to ketones.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH and a CHO. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol, which is then oxidized to a ketone, and further modified.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane could be converted into a diol via hydroboration, but I don't see that reagent in the options.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, but I don't see that either.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated, and then oxidized.

Looking back at option C:

After step 1 and 2, the molecule is a longer chain with a single bond. Step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond, which isn't present. So that's a problem.

But wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. How? Maybe the hydrogenation doesn't go all the way.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation step is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is not of the triple bond but of some other part of the molecule. But I don't think that's the case.

Another thought: Maybe the target molecule is formed via a Grignard reaction, but I don't see Mg-based reagents in the options.

Wait, looking at option D again:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → Perhaps this is a deprotonation, followed by alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3 → Maybe for Birch reduction, which would add substituents to the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's used for elimination.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about each step in option C.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → Alkyne alkylation, adding a methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2 and Pd → Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. Now the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but the molecule now is a single bond. So this step doesn't make sense. Therefore, option C can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a step that forms a double bond. Wait, is there any way that step 2 could form a double bond?

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation is not of the triple bond but of something else. But the starting material doesn't have any double bonds.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via hydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a benzyl-type structure, which is then functionalized.

But I'm not connecting it.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, maybe after step 1, the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

Step 2: Hydrogenation converts the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

But then step 3 is ozonolysis, which needs a double bond. So unless there's a double bond elsewhere, this doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexane ring itself undergoes a reaction. For example, if the cyclohexane ring is opened, but that's not indicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the alkylation and hydrogenation steps form a new double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the alkylation adds a substituent that, upon hydrogenation, creates a ring expansion, leading to a new double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation leads to a longer chain, which upon hydrogenation, forms a ring, creating a double bond.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible reactions.

Looking at option C:

After step 2, the molecule is a longer chain with single bonds. Step 3 is ozonolysis, which can't act on single bonds. Therefore, option C's step 3 is invalid, so option C is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D: Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol.

Wait, methanol is a methylating agent. So perhaps this step is methylating the alkyne, making it CH2-C≡C-OCH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a Grignard-like reagent. But with NaNH2 and methanol, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH and a CHO. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. To form an aldehyde from an alkene, ozonolysis is a common method.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation.
2. Reduction to form a double bond.
3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.
4. Work-up to form aldehydes.

But how would the reduction form a double bond?

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation step doesn't go all the way. For example, using a Lindlar catalyst would hydrogenate a triple bond to a cis double bond. But the options don't specify the catalyst.

Assuming that, let's say that step 2 in option C is H2 with a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar), which would reduce the triple bond to a cis double bond.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, the triple bond after alkylation is CH2-C≡C-CH3. If step 2 is hydrogenation with Lindlar catalyst, it would become CH2-C=C-CH3 (cis). Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the structure would become two carbonyl groups attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but the target molecule has a single substituent with a hydroxymethyl and a formyl group.

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, we get a diketone, which is then reduced.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of another approach.

Another thought: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group, so perhaps a cyclopropane ring is opened, but I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation, which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. But the steps don't seem to include such reagents.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C, despite my confusion.

Wait, let me think again about option C:

Step 1: Alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond.

Step 2: H2/Pd → Full hydrogenation of triple bond to single bond.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → No double bond, so nothing happens. So this can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Another way: Maybe the hydrogenation in step 2 is not of the alkyne but of the cyclohexane ring. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should check which options include an aldehyde-forming step.

Looking at the options, all steps 3 or 4 involve reactions that could form carbonyls.

Option B: Step 3 is O3/H2O, which would form carbonyl groups.

Option C: Step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S, which forms carbonyl groups.

Option D: Step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis won't work.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation in step 2 isn't of the triple bond but of a different part, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation → adds a methyl group.

2. Partial hydrogenation to a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up to form aldehydes.

But without knowing the exact steps, it's challenging.

Given that, perhaps the correct option is option C.


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and a formyl group (CHO). The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: This step likely alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding a methyl group to the triple bond, forming CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
2. **H2/Pd**: This reduces the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: This step could promote elimination or oxidation, but it is unclear how this would lead to the desired functional groups.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: These reagents are typically used for oxidation or dehydration, but the sequence does not clearly form the hydroxymethyl or aldehyde groups.

This option does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding an ethyl group to the triple bond, forming CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: This strong base could promote elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present in the molecule after step 2.
4. **NH4OH**: This mild reducing agent is used for work-up after ozonolysis, but without a double bond, this step is ineffective.

This option fails to produce the required functional groups.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding a methyl group to the triple bond, forming CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: This reduces the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present after step 2. This step is invalid.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: This step could promote elimination or oxidation, but it does not compensate for the lack of a double bond in step 3.

This option is invalid due to the absence of a double bond for ozonolysis.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: This step likely deprotonates the terminal alkyne and introduces a methyl group, forming CH2-C≡C-OCH3 attached to cyclohexane.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: This strong base could promote elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present after step 2. This step is invalid.
4. **NH4OH**: This mild reducing agent is used for work-up after ozonolysis, but without a double bond, this step is ineffective.

This option also fails to produce the required functional groups.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly lead to the target molecule. However, **Option C** is the most plausible because it includes steps that could potentially form the necessary intermediates, even though the sequence has flaws (e.g., the lack of a double bond for ozonolysis in step 3).
