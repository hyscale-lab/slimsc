Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue. The matrix form is given as Ay = c·S, with c = h/(4π) and S is this matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). 

Wait, so S looks like this:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So, Ay should be (h/4π) multiplied by matrix S. So let me write that out:
Ay = (h/4π) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh wait, the question is about which statement is correct during this calculation. The options are A, B, C, D.

Let me think about the general approach. Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0. So, let's find the eigenvalues first.

The matrix Ay is a 2x2, so the characteristic equation is ( ( (h/(4π)) * 0 - a ) ) * ( (h/(4π))*0 - a ) ) - ( (h/(4π))*(-i) ) * ( (h/(4π))*i ) = 0.

Wait, let me compute this correctly. The matrix Ay would be:

[ 0          -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0         ]

So the matrix is:

[ 0        -i c ]
[ i c      0   ]

where c = h/(4π).

The characteristic equation is:

|Ay - aI| = 0
=> determinant of [ -a, -i c ]
                [ i c, -a ]

So determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c² )

Wait, (-i c)*(i c) = (-i)(i) c². What's (-i)(i)? That's (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. Because i² is -1, so (-i)(i)= -i² = 1.

So determinant is a² - (1)(c²) = a² - c² = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c.

Wait, c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh or something. That seems off because my calculation says the eigenvalues are real, because a² = c², so a is ±c, which is real. So the eigenvalues are real, positive and negative h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, no imaginary parts. So any option talking about imaginary parts can be dismissed.

Looking at the options: option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or –2πh. That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect. Option B: same issue, it's talking about imaginary parts. So B is incorrect too.

Now, option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. Hmm. Let me think. The square of the angular momentum operator A² would have eigenvalues related to the total angular momentum. For spin-1/2 particles, like the muon, which is a lepton, the spin is ½. So A² would have eigenvalues ( (½)(½+1) ) * ħ². But wait, wait, in this case,
