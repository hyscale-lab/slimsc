Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I think I should figure out the concentrations after dilution. When you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

Wait, but wait. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? So the new concentration of acetic acid would be (0.05 M) * (20 cm³) / (40 cm³) = 0.025 M. Oh, got it. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid initially present. So, let me calculate the moles of acetic acid first. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be 0.001. So the volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question isn't asking for the volume; it's asking about pH at 25% titration and equivalence point.

Wait, but for the equivalence point, what happens? Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). This will form a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions.

To find the pH at equivalence, I need to find the concentration of acetate ions. The total volume at equivalence is the initial volume of acetic acid solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³). So total volume is 50 cm³ or 0.05 L. The moles of acetate are 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze as: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.
The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kw is 1e-14. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of OH^- can be found using the Kb expression. Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [
