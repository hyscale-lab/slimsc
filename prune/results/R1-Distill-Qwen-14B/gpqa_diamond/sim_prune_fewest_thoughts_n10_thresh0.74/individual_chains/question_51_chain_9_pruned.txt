Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think through it. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, right, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially grounded ones, there are some specific things to consider.

Alright, the setup: a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. So, the sphere is a conductor and it's grounded. Grounded means that any excess charge on the sphere can go into the ground, right? So, when you bring a charge near a grounded conductor, the conductor will induce charges on its surface, but because it's grounded, those induced charges can leave the sphere, keeping its net charge zero.

Wait, but wait a second. If the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charges due to the external charge q would cause the sphere to have charges that would leave it, keeping it neutral overall. But wait, the charge q is outside the sphere, so does that mean the sphere's induced charges would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as the ground? Because in electrostatics, the conductor's surface would be an equipotential. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So, the induced charges would arrange themselves to make the potential on the sphere's surface zero.

But wait, the charge q is outside the sphere. When you have a charge outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges will redistribute to cancel the field inside the conductor. So, the sphere's surface would have induced charges, but since it's grounded, that charge can flow away. Wait, so the
