Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let's read it carefully.

So, the experiment involves tagging rotavirus's inner capsid proteins with GFP. They delivered them to mice via oral gavage, which is like feeding them a solution. Then, they used in vivo imaging and saw that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Others got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and took the proliferating cells, then sequenced their variable heavy chain genes. They saw high variability. The question is asking which process is happening.

Hmm, the options are A to D, processes like somatic hypermutation, complement activation, class switching, VDJ recombination.

Let me think. Rotavirus is a pathogen that usually infects the gut, right? When you take it orally, it goes through the stomach. So, the inner capsid proteins are probably antigens that the immune system responds to.

Stomach acid would break down some of these tagged proteins, which explains why some fluorescence was destroyed. But others moved past the mucus and reached the secondary lymphoid organs. Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), so they're where immune responses to gut pathogens are initiated.

When the cells from Peyer patches are isolated and their variable heavy chain genes sequenced, high variability suggests a process that creates diverse antibodies. 

So, let's look at the options. VDJ recombination is during B cell development in the bone marrow, where the variable, diversity, and joining segments are combined to create the initial diversity of the B cell receptors. But once a B cell is activated, it undergoes other processes. 

Class switching recombination happens after the initial B cell response. It changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), which is part of the maturation of the immune response, but doesn't directly create variability in the variable regions.

Somatic hypermutation occurs during the generation of memory B cells and plasma cells in the germinal centers. This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors, increasing the diversity of antibodies. So, this leads to high variability in the variable heavy chains.

Wait, but when would this happen? Peyer patches have B cells, and when a pathogen is taken up, it's processed, and the B cells in the patches would encounter antigens. In the germinal centers, these B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and compete, leading to a diverse set of antibodies.

So, the high variability in the variable heavy chain after the immune response suggests that the B cells have undergone somatic hypermutation. 

Alternatively, VDJ recombination is about generating the initial diversity, but that happens during B cell development, not in response to an antigen. So, the high variability in the variable chains after exposure would be due to somatic hypermutation, which happens in the germinal centers.

So the process taking place is A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus's inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, while others reached the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer patches suggests a process that generates diverse antibodies.

Analyzing the options:

- **VDJ recombination** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity in B cell receptors. This happens before antigen exposure and does not explain the observed variability in response to rotavirus.
- **Class switching recombination** changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and occurs after the initial immune response. It does not directly contribute to variability in the variable regions of the heavy chains.
- **Complement activation** is a part of the immune response but does not directly explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Somatic hypermutation** occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, introducing point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors. This process increases antibody diversity and matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chains.

Given that the high variability in the variable heavy chains is observed after antigen exposure and in the context of an immune response, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
