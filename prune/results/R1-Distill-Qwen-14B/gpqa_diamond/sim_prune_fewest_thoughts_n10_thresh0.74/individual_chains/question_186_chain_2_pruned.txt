Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, the molecule given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. I'm a bit rusty on my Cope rearrangement mechanisms, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically occurs in 1,5-dienes, right? So the starting material should have a conjugated diene system.

Looking at the structure of the given molecule: it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. So it's a norbornene structure. Let me visualize it. Norbornene is like a bicyclic compound with two rings: a five-membered and a bridge. The substituents are at specific positions.

The molecule is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the substituents are a vinyl group and an azabicyclo... Wait, the 2-azabicyclo means that the bridgehead has a nitrogen. So the structure has a bridge with a nitrogen at position 2.

Wait, the structure is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo is [2.2.1], meaning two carbons on each bridge. So the rings are a five-membered and a four-membered? Or wait, no, bicyclo[m.n.p] means m, n, p are the number of carbons on each bridge. For [2.2.1], I think it's two bridges with two carbons each, and one bridge with one carbon. So the structure is norbornene with a nitrogen at one of the bridgeheads.

The substituent is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl group is attached to the same carbon as the nitrogen. So the structure is a bicyclo with a vinyl group attached to the N?

Wait, no, the substituent is 2-vinyl, meaning the vinyl is attached to carbon 2. And the molecule is 2-azabicyclo, so carbon 2 has the nitrogen as part of the bicy
