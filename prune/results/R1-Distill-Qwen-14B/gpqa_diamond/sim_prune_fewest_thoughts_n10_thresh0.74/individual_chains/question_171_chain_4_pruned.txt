Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrophilic substitution reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the substitution of bromine on various aromatic compounds, and we're supposed to arrange them based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the goal is to figure out, for each compound, whether the para product is the major one, and then order them from the lowest to highest weight fraction of para.

First, I remember that the position of substitution in aromatic compounds depends on the directing groups present. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions, while deactivating groups do the opposite.

Let me list out the compounds again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (phenyl acetate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

So, each of these has a substituent attached to the benzene ring. I need to determine the directing nature and the activation/deactivation effect of each substituent.

Starting with each substituent:

1) CH3: The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. That's because the +I effect (inductive effect) is electron-donating, making the ring more reactive and directing the substitution to ortho and para positions.

2) COOEt (phenyl acetate): The acetate group is an ester. Ester groups are deactivating because the oxygen in the ester is more electronegative, pulling electrons away from the ring via the inductive effect. But wait, esters are actually ortho/para-directing deactivating groups. Because the lone pairs on the oxygen can conjugate into the ring through resonance, making the ring still reactive but less so than benzene. So substituents like NO2 are more deactivating but still para/ortho directors.

Wait, wait, no. Waitâ€”no, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. The ester group (like COOR) is an example of a meta director, isn't it? Or is it para/ortho? Hmm. Maybe I'm getting mixed up. Oh, no, wait, substituents with lone pairs can sometimes direct. Let me recall: groups with lone pairs that are deactivating can be ortho/para directors if they can conjugate, like the -O- group in ethers. But in esters, the carbonyl group is adjacent. So the ester group is actually an electron-withdrawing group. So they are deactivating, but they can still donate some resonance. So I think ester groups are meta directors? Or are they para/ortho? Hmm, maybe I should check my notes. Oh wait, no, I can't. I'll have to think.
