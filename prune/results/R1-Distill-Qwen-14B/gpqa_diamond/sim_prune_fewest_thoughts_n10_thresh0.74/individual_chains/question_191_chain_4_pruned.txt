Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me draw this structure mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1 (so cyclohexanone). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So that's an isopropenyl group. So 5-(isopropenyl) cyclohexanone with a hydroxymethyl at 3.

The first step is treatment with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Where would it deprotonate here? The compound has an alcohol group (from the hydroxymethyl), but that's acidic but not super. Alternatively, maybe the alpha protons adjacent to the ketone are more acidic. Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexanone, so alpha protons (on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) are more acidic. The hydroxymethyl is on C3, which is adjacent to C2 (which is adjacent to C1, the carbonyl). So, the C3 has a CH2OH group. The alpha protons would be on C2 and perhaps others. So if we deprotonate alpha to the carbonyl, we can get an enolate.

Once the enolate is formed, benzyl bromide would act as an electrophile. So the enolate would attack benzyl bromide in an alkylation. So the benzyl group would add to the alpha position. Let's see: the ketone is at C1. The alpha carbons are C2 (and maybe others, but in this case, the ring is such that C2 is adjacent to C1). So the enolate would form at C2, and benzyl bromide would add a benzyl group there. So after this step, product 1 would have a benzyl group attached to C2.

Wait, but the starting material's structure is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. So after alkylation, product 1 would have the benzyl group on C2, making it 2-benzyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one?

Wait, but wait, the initial structure is 3-(hydroxymethyl), so maybe the enolate forms at C2, leading to the substitution there. So the product 1 would have a benzyl group attached to C2, and the rest as before.

Second step: product 1 is treated with p-toluenes
