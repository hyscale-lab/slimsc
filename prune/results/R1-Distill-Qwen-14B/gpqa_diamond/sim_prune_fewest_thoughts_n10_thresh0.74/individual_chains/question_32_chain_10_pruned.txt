Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, so Li is lithium, right? Let me think about what that means.

Wait, Li with 3 neutrons is Li-6 because lithium usually has 3 protons. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. But wait, in the collider, are they considering it as a heavy ion, so maybe it's a charged ion, like a + charge? So perhaps it's a Li-6 nucleus with a charge of +3e or something like that. But for the purpose of calculating energy, maybe the charge doesn't matter directly, just the mass.

So the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high, so relativistic effects are significant. So I think I'll need to use the relativistic energy equations, probably the total energy formula.

The formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So I can calculate gamma first using the given speed.

Let me compute that. The speed v is 0.96c.
