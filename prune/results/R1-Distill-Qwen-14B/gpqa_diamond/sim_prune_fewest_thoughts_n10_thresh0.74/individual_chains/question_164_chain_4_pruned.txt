Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

So, the problem is about binary star systems—specifically, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods, which are the times between two primary eclipses. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has a period of 1 year. Interesting, so system_2's period is half that of system_1.

Then, there's some spectroscopic data. In system_1, the stars have radial velocity (RV) variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Radial velocity variations in binary systems usually indicate the Doppler effect as the stars orbit each other. The amplitude of these variations depends on the mass of the companion and the orbital setup.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, so I need to find the mass ratio, system_1 mass divided by system_2 mass.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, each star orbits a common center of mass. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of each star is related to the mass of the other star. The more massive star would have a smaller RV amplitude because it's orbiting a smaller circle (since the center of mass is closer to the more massive star). So, in system_1, one star has a higher amplitude than the other, which suggests a mass ratio. Similarly for system_2.

I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars, P is the orbital period, and i is the inclination angle. But since both stars in each system are observed, maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass because they share the same orbital period. So, M1 / M2 = v2 / v1, where v1 and v2 are the velocities
