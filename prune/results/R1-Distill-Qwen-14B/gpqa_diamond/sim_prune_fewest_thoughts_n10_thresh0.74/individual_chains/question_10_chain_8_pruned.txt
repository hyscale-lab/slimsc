Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out. The question is asking which of the given options has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of the options.

Wait, the question lists four options (a to d) and the answer options are A to D, each pointing to a to d. So, for example, answer A is option d, and so on.

So each option describes a planet with certain characteristics. I need to find out which has the highest density.

Density is mass divided by volume, right? So density = mass/volume. And the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if two planets have the same radius, the one with more mass has higher density. But if they have different sizes, the volume changes with the cube of the radius.

Let's look at each option:

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
So mass is same as Earth, radius same. So density is same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So that's a baseline.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.
Wait, the density is given here. So the density is 5.5, which is same as Earth. So this planet's density is same as Earth. So it's not higher than a.

Wait, but wait, option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So that's given. So that's same as Earth's density, so same as option a's density. So a and b have same density.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
Hmm, same composition as Earth. So same density. Because composition determines density. If the planet is made of same stuff as Earth, then density would be same, regardless of mass or radius. Because if you increase mass without changing composition, the radius increases, but since density is mass/volume, and volume scales with r³, but mass scales with r^3 (if density is same). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, if a planet has the same composition as Earth, then its density is same as Earth's. Because density is an intrinsic property based on composition. So even if it's more
