Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth (apparent magnitude) is what determines if a telescope can detect it. Both instruments have different limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. So, wait, that means ESPRESSO can see fainter stars because the magnitude scale is invertedâ€”lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V=17 is dimmer than V=16.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both instruments. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude that is brighter than both 17 (for ESPRESSO) and 16 (for HIRES). Wait, no, actually, no. Because each spectrograph can observe stars that are brighter than their respective magnitude limits. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. If it's brighter than 16, HIRES can see it. So for a star to be detectable by both, it has to be brighter than 17 mag, because that's the lower limit (since 17 is fainter than 16). Wait, no, because if a star is brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17. So if a star is brighter than 16, both can detect it. But if it's between 16 and 17, only HIRES can. If it's above 17, only ESPRESSO can. So the star must have apparent V magnitude below 16 to be detected by both. Because that's the more restrictive condition.

Wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be brighter than 16 mag, because both can observe up to their own limits. Wait, no: ESPRESSO can observe up to 17 (brighter than 17), and HIRES up to 16. So a star that's brighter than both 17 and 16 would be the same as brighter than 17. Because 16 is brighter
