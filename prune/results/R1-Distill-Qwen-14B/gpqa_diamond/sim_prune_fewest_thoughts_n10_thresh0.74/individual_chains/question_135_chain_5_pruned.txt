Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem gives me the interaction Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that better. Oh right, the interaction term is probably something like λ times some fermion fields interacting with X. But the exact form might not matter as much as the fact that X is a boson that couples to fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is about what particles it can decay into kinematically. Kinematically allowed means the decay products' masses should be less than the mass of X. So I need to consider the possible fermion pairs that the X boson can decay into, based on their masses.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which I think are fermion fields. So X must couple to fermions. So the decay would be X → fermion-antifermion pair. So possible decay channels are things like X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

But what fermions can X decay into? Well, the fermion mass has to be less than half the mass of X, because for pair production, each fermion has to have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So if X has mass M, each fermion should have mass m where m ≤ M/2.

Wait, X is 6 GeV, so M=6 GeV. So each fermion must have a mass ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions are lighter than or equal to 3 GeV? Let's list them.

Known fermion masses (approximate):

- Electron (e): 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): 0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): 1.78 GeV
- Up (u): ~0.0035 GeV
- Down (d): ~0.005 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 Ge
