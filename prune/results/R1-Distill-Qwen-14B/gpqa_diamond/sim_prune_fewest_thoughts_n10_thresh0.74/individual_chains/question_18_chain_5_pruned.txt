Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, I'm not sure if the masses will directly affect the elemental ratios. Maybe not, since the question is about photospheric compositions. I'll focus on the abundance data given.

The data provided is:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by 0.3 dex.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg to Si ratio in Star_2 is higher than in the Sun by 0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is the logarithm (base 10) of (nFe/nH) divided by the Sun's value. If it's zero, then nFe/nH is the same as solar.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So same as above, Mg to H ratio in Star_2 is solar.

Wait, the problem also gives the Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Let me compute that. 10^(-4) is 0.0001, and 10^(-0.5) is about 0.316. So 0.0001 * 0.316 ≈ 3.16e-5.
Similarly for Mg:
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5. So nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but wait. The notation is a bit confusing. Let me double-check. The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log
