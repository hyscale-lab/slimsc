Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the question provides some key info about the brightness limits of each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh wait, no—wait, the way it's worded: "brighter than" meaning lower magnitude numbers are brighter. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So brightness in terms of apparent magnitude: lower is better. So for a star to be observable, its apparent magnitude V must be less than or equal to 17 mag for ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no—no, the way the question is worded is that the spectrographs can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 and 16, respectively. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.

The question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So, if a star's apparent V mag is brighter than 17 (i.e., less than 17), then ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 can be observed, so apparent V mag <16.

Wait, no. Wait, the way it's written, "brighter than 17 mag." So, the apparent magnitude is a measure where lower numbers mean brighter. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent V magnitude is less than 17. Because if a star is brighter, it has a lower apparent magnitude. For example, a star with V=10 is brighter than one with V=15.

So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V < 17 can be detected. For HIRES, stars with V <16 can be detected.

So, any star that has apparent V magnitude less than 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and only those with less than 16 can be seen by HIRES.

Now, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So, the star's apparent V mag must be less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it), and also less than 16 (so HIRES can see it). Because if a star has V mag 16.5, ESPRESSO can see it (16.5<17), but HIRES can't (16.5>16). Wait, wait, no: the limit for HIRES is brighter than 16, so V mag less than 16. So a star with V=16.5 is dimmer than 16, so it's not bright enough for HIRES. So, the star must have V mag less than 16 to be detectable by both.

Wait, but wait a second: no, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17. So, stars with V <17 mag can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <16.

So, for a star to be seen by both, it must be that its apparent V mag is less than 16. Because that's the stricter condition. Because 16 is lower than 17. So only stars with V <16 can be observed by both. Stars with V between 16 and 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

So now I need to calculate the apparent V magnitudes of each star and see which meet this condition.

Each star has some data. Let's go through each one.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M +5 log10(d) -5. So d=10, log10(10)=1. So m =15.5 +5*(1) -5 =15.5 +5-5=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Which is less than both 16 and 17. So both spectrographs can detect it. So Star1 is a candidate.

Wait, but let me check. Because Star1's absolute magnitude is 15.5, and distance is 10 pc. Since absolute magnitude is the apparent mag at 10 pc, so Star1's apparent mag is 15.5. So yes, both spectrographs can see it.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5, located at 5 pc. So m=16.5. So for ESPRESSO, 16.5 <17 is yes. But for HIRES, 16.5>16, so no. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not by HIRES. So not a candidate.

Star3: It's given an apparent V mag of 15.5, but then it also has E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, so there's extinction (interstellar dust) that makes stars appear dimmer. So the actual apparent mag without extinction would be lower, but wait, no. Wait, the E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the amount by which the star's color is reddened. The total absorption in V band is E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1. So the extinction in V band (Av) is 3.1 * E(B-V). So, the apparent magnitude we observe (m) is the true magnitude (m0) plus Av. Because extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher apparent magnitude). So m = m0 + Av.

Wait, no. Wait, I think the formula is m_observed = m_true + Av. Because if there's extinction, the star appears dimmer, so a higher m.

So, the star's apparent V mag as given is 15.5, but if there's extinction, the true apparent mag would be lower. Wait, no. Wait, no, the given apparent mag is 15.5, but that includes the extinction. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the question says, Star3 has an apparent V mag of 15.5, but there's extinction with E(B-V)=0.6. So, what is the actual apparent magnitude without extinction? Or wait, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is already corrected? Hmm.

Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Wait, so perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed (extincted) magnitude. So the actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude without extinction would be m0 = m_observed - Av.

Because m_observed = m0 + Av.

Since Av = 3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So m0 =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

So without extinction, the star would have an apparent mag of 13.64. But for the purpose of detection, what matters is the observed apparent magnitude, which is 15.5, right? Because the spectrographs observe the star as it appears through the interstellar medium.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic value, and the extinction makes it dimmer. Wait, but the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag." Then, with E(B-V)=0.6, so Av=1.86. So the star's light has been dimmed, so the observed apparent mag would be m = m_true + Av.

Wait, that's correct. So if the star's true apparent mag (without extinction) is m_true, then the observed is m = m_true + Av.

But in this case, Star3 is given an apparent V mag of 15.5. Does that include extinction, or is it the true mag? Hmm, the way the question is phrased: it says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Wait, but the distance is 15 pc. Wait, but then the absolute magnitude is M = m -5 +5 log10(d). Wait, but for a star, M is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So for Star3, if it's at 15 pc, the apparent magnitude is M +5 log10(15) -5.

Wait, but no. The absolute magnitude is M, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So if a star is at d pc, then m = M +5 log10(d/10) = M +5 (log10 d -1) = M +5 log10 d -5.

So for Star3, if it's at 15 pc, and M is given, then m = M +5 log10(15) -5. But wait, I'm getting confused because Star3's data is given as an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps Star3's apparent mag includes extinction, and the absolute magnitude is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me make a table to track each star:

I think the key is to compute the apparent V mag for each star, considering whether there's extinction, and then see if it's below 17 and 16 for the respective spectrographs.

Let me go through each star step by step.

Star1:
- Absolute V mag M =15.5
- Distance d=10 pc.
So m = M +5(log10(10)) -5 =15.5 +5(1) -5=15.5.

No extinction mentioned, so m=15.5. So for both spectrographs: 15.5 <16 and <17, so both can see it.

Star2:
- Apparent V mag =16.5
- Distance 5 pc. Wait, but do we need to compute anything else here? Because the apparent magnitude is already given as 16.5. So for Star2, m=16.5.

But wait, does the distance matter? No, because apparent magnitude is given. Since it's already m=16.5, it's brighter than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it), but dimmer than 16 (so HIRES can't). So only ESPRESSO can see Star2.

Star3:
- Apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, but extinction (Av=3.1 * E(B-V))=1.86. So, the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_true + Av.

Wait, but if the apparent mag without extinction is m_true, then the observed is m = m_true + Av. But in this case, the apparent mag given is 15.5. Is that the observed (with extinction) or the true (intrinsic) magnitude?

Ah, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." Hmm. So perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude as observed, including extinction. So the actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude would be m_true = m_observed - Av.

Wait, but why would we care about the intrinsic apparent magnitude? Because the spectrographs' brightness limits are based on the observed apparent magnitude. Because the spectrograph sees the star as it is observed through the interstellar medium. So for detection, the observed apparent magnitude is what matters.

So for Star3, m =15.5, which is less than 16 and 17. So both spectrographs can see it. Because 15.5 is less than 16, so HIRES can detect it, and less than 17, so ESPRESSO can too.

But wait, no. Let me think again. Because the apparent magnitude given for Star3 is 15.5, which is after considering extinction. So the star's light is dimmed by Av=1.86, but when we observe it, it's 15.5. So for us, the observed magnitude is 15.5. So it's bright enough for both.

Wait, but wait another thing. Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, which would be its observed (with extinction) magnitude. So it's already 15.5, which is below both 16 and 17. So yes, both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, wait a moment. Let me think again. Because the star's actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be m_true = m_observed - Av.

So Star3's m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But since extinction makes stars appear dimmer, the observed magnitude is higher. So the star is actually brighter than it appears. But the observed magnitude is 15.5. So for the purposes of detection, the observed magnitude is what matters. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is within the brightness limits of both spectrographs. So both can detect it.

Wait, but this would mean Star3 is detectable by both. But let me look at the options. The options are combinations of the stars. Let's hold on and process the other stars.

Star4:
- Absolute V mag =15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

So first, compute the apparent magnitude without extinction: M =15.5, d=10 pc. So m = M +5 log10(10) -5 =15.5 +5(1) -5=15.5.

But then, extinction is present. Av=3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So the observed m = m_true + Av =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, so the apparent magnitude including extinction is 16.74.

Wait, no, wait. If the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) is 15.5, then the observed magnitude would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So the observed m is 16.74.

So for detection, Star4's observed m is 16.74.

So for ESPRESSO: 16.74 <17? No, it's 16.74 which is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can detect it.

For HIRES: 16.74 <16? No, because 16.74 is larger than 16. So HIRES can't detect it.

So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but wait. Another way: the absolute magnitude is M=15.5. So without extinction, m_true =15.5. But extinction adds 1.24, so m_observed is 16.74. So yes, it's 16.74 which is above 16, so only ESPRESSO can see it.

Star5:
- Absolute V mag =16.5, distance 5 pc.

Compute apparent magnitude without extinction: m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=5 pc, so log10(5)=0.69897.

So m =16.5 +5*(0.69897) -5.

5*(0.69897) ≈3.4949.

So m=16.5 +3.4949 -5 =16.5+3.4949=19.9949, minus 5 is 14.9949, approximately 15.0.

Wait, wait: wait, 16.5 +3.4949=19.9949, then subtract 5 is 14.9949. So m≈15.0.

Then, is there any extinction? The data for Star5 says nothing about E(B-V), so perhaps no extinction. So m=15.0.

So Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0.

So for detection:

ESPRESSO: 15.0 <17 → yes.

HIRES: 15.0 <16 → yes.

So both can detect Star5.

Wait, but wait—Star5's data: absolute V mag is 16.5, at 5 pc. So, m = M +5(log10(5) -1) → M=16.5, log10(5)=0.69897, so 0.69897-1= -0.30103. Multiply by 5: -1.50515. So m=16.5 + (-1.50515) =14.99485, which is ~15.0.

So yes, m=15.0, which is below both 16 and 17.

So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait: the options are combinations of stars that can be detected by both. So which stars can be detected by both spectrographs.

Let me summarize each star:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

Wait, but wait, Star3's calculation. Let me recheck.

Star3: apparent V mag is given as 15.5 with E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if a star is at 15 pc, and has absolute magnitude M, then its apparent magnitude would be M +5 log10(15) -5.

But Star3's data doesn't mention an absolute magnitude, but only an apparent magnitude. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude for Star3 already includes extinction, so we don't need to adjust it. Because the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" and E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps that's the observed m, so the true m would be m_observed - Av. But for detection purposes, the observed m is what matters.

Wait, but in this case, I think the given m is the apparent magnitude as observed, including extinction. So for Star3, m=15.5. So it's below both 16 and 17. So both can detect.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m_true, and the observed is m_observed = m_true + Av.

So Star3's m_observed is 15.5. So Av is 1.86, so m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But the observed magnitude is 15.5, which is what the spectrograph would see.

So for Star3, m=15.5. So both can detect.

Wait, no. The spectrographs are looking at the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. So Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is below 16 and 17. So both can detect it.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but let me check each option.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, only ESPRESSO. So A is out.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both. So B is a possibility.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES, so C is out.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so D is out.

So the correct answer would be B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck Star3.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, which is already below 16 and 17, so yes. But wait, isn't the apparent magnitude already including extinction? Then the observed magnitude is 15.5, which is acceptable for both.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what Star3's data says. Star3 has an apparent V mag of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. The question says that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av=1.86.

So if Star3's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true, then the observed is m_observed = m_true +1.86.

But the question gives m_observed as 15.5. So m_true =15.5 - 1.86=13.64. But the observed magnitude is 15.5, which is what matters for detection.

So Star3's observed magnitude is 15.5, so both spectrographs can see it.

Star5's observed magnitude is 15.0, which both can see.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. So that's one of them.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star1's m is 15.5, so both can detect. So why isn't Star1 in the options? Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct answer would be B) Star3 and Star5.

But wait, what about Star1?

Star1's m=15.5. So both can detect. So why isn't it in any option with others? Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A) 4 &5.

B)3 &5.

C)2 &3.

D)1 &4.

So none of the options include Star1 and Star5, for example.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck Star1.

Star1: absolute V mag 15.5, at 10 pc.

m = M +5 log10(10) -5 =15.5 +5*1 -5=15.5. So m=15.5. So both can see.

So why isn't Star1 in any of the options?

Looking at the options, option D is Star1 and Star4. Star4's m is 16.74, so only ESPRESSO can see it. So D is out.

Option B is Star3 and Star5. Both can be seen by both.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake with Star3's m. Let's double-check.

Star3's data: apparent V mag is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, so Av=1.86.

But wait, the apparent magnitude given is the observed one, so m_observed=15.5. So for detection, that's the value that matters.

Since 15.5 <16, Star3 can be detected by both.

Similarly, Star5: m=15.0, so both can detect.

So the answer should be option B: Star3 and Star5.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the brightness limits of the spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 (i.e., \( m < 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 (i.e., \( m < 16 \)). Therefore, a star must have \( m < 16 \) to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)
- Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5 \)
- Extinction: Not mentioned, so \( m = 15.5 \).
- Detection: \( m = 15.5 < 16 \) and \( m = 15.5 < 17 \).  
  **Both spectrographs can detect Star1.**

#### **Star2**:
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \)
- Extinction: Not mentioned, so \( m = 16.5 \).
- Detection: \( m = 16.5 < 17 \) (ESPRESSO can detect), but \( m = 16.5 \geq 16 \) (HIRES cannot detect).  
  **Only ESPRESSO can detect Star2.**

#### **Star3**:
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \)
- Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \)
- Observed apparent magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \) (already includes extinction).
- Detection: \( m = 15.5 < 16 \) and \( m = 15.5 < 17 \).  
  **Both spectrographs can detect Star3.**

#### **Star4**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)
- Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)
- Apparent V magnitude without extinction: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5 \)
- Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \)
- Observed apparent magnitude: \( m = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \)
- Detection: \( m = 16.74 < 17 \) (ESPRESSO can detect), but \( m = 16.74 \geq 16 \) (HIRES cannot detect).  
  **Only ESPRESSO can detect Star4.**

#### **Star5**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \)
- Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)
- Apparent V magnitude without extinction:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 \approx 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 15.0
  \]
- Extinction: Not mentioned, so \( m = 15.0 \).
- Detection: \( m = 15.0 < 16 \) and \( m = 15.0 < 17 \).  
  **Both spectrographs can detect Star5.**

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** (\( m = 15.5 \)) and **Star5** (\( m = 15.0 \)). 

**Correct Answer: B**
