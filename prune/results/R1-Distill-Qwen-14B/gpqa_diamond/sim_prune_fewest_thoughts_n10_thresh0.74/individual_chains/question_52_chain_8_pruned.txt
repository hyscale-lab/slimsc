Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down. The question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, it affects their overall brightness and temperature, but I'm not exactly sure how that ties into the energy levels of atoms in the photosphere.

Alright, the star in question has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the effective temperature decrease when there are spots? Oh right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they make the star appear dimmer and cooler overall.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas. The Boltzmann factor tells us that higher energy levels are less populated when the temperature is lower. The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K versus 6000 K). The ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels is (n1 / n2) when the star is spotless versus when it has spots. The question says this ratio decreases when spots are present. So, when the star is cooler, the ratio is lower. Therefore, without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor by which it changes (when no spots) is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

But wait, the ratio is n1/n2. Let me think about how temperature affects this. The ratio depends exponentially on the temperature. Let's say level 1 is higher in energy than level 2, so E1 > E2. So the energy difference is E1 - E2 = ΔE. Then the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

If the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) becomes smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease if E1 is higher than E2. So when the star has lower Teff (spots), the ratio is lower. Which aligns with the problem statement.

So we need to compute the ratio of the ratios. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Let me write this factor as F = [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ].

Wait, the g1/g2 terms cancel out, so F = exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ].

Wait, wait. Let me re-derive that. Because the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) ), which is same as (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming ΔE = E1 - E2.

So when T changes, the exponential term changes. So when T decreases (spots), the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio lower. So F
