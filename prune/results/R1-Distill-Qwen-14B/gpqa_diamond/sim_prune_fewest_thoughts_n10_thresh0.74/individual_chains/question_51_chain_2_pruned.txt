Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says: A charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics... I remember that when you bring charges together, you do work against the electric field, and that work is stored as potential energy. But this involves a conducting sphere, so things might be a bit different.

Grounded conducting sphere... Oh right, a conducting sphere in electrostatic equilibrium has the charge distributed on its surface. And since it's grounded, any induced charges can flow to the ground. So when you place a charge near a grounded conductor, the conductor's induced charges adjust accordingly. But wait, the sphere is conducting, so the induced charges will be on its surface. But since it's grounded, electrons can flow in or out, so the sphere's potential is the same as the ground, which is zero.

Wait, but the charge q is placed outside the sphere. So the sphere is going to have induced charges. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can adjust to maintain the sphere's potential at zero. 

Let me think about image charges. For a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be modeled using image charges. For a point charge outside a grounded sphere, the image charge method says that the sphere behaves as if there's another charge inside it. The image charge would be located along the line connecting the center of the sphere to the charge q.

The formula for the image charge when the sphere is grounded is q' = - (q R ) / d. Wait, I
