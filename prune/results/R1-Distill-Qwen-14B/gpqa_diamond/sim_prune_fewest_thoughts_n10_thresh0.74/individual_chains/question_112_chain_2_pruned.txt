Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it again.

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I know are the standard basis states for spin-½ systems. The problem is about calculating the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation is given. The matrix A has elements Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Wait, so the operator's matrix is such that the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So it's a 2x2 matrix. Let me represent it:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that looks like a spin operator but transposed? Or maybe it's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A is (ħ/2) times that. So A is proportional to sigma_x.

Wait, but the problem mentions eigenstates of this operator A. So to find the probabilities, I need to find the eigenstates of A and then find how |alpha> is projected onto them.

Wait, but wait
