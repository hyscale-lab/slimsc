Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice chemistry question. Hmm, let's read through it carefully.

So the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them. The substances are labeled A1 through A5, each with different properties.

Starting with A1: It decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Oh wait, oxidizing agents are usually things that get reduced. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually unreactive, but if A1 causes it to oxidize, maybe A1 is something like a fluoride that can oxidize Xe. Wait, but Xe is in a high oxidation state, right? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a fluorine compound that when decomposed, releases F2?

Then, A2 has oF (I think oF stands for the ortho/para ratio for F2, but maybe it's the oxidation state here? Or perhaps it's the degree of fluorination. Wait, oF=31.96% might be the percentage of fluorine in the compound. Hmm, 31.96% is roughly the atomic weight of fluorine as a percentage of the compound. So if a compound has F at 31.96%, maybe it's YF. Because fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19. So YF would have F as 19/(19 + Y), so if that's 31.96%, let's calculate.

31.96% is 0.3196. So 19/(19 + Y) = 0.3196. Let's solve for Y.

19 = 0.3196*(19 + Y)
19 = 0.3196*19 + 0.3196 Y
19 = approx 6.0724 + 0.3196 Y
19 - 6.0724 = 0.3196 Y
12.9276 ≈ 0.3196 Y
Y ≈
