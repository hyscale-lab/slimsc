Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. 

The question says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (like a C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, the aromatic ring is 6-membered, like benzene, but di-substituted. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the ring. The compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Wait, no, because each substituent might have more than one carbon. Let me think.

Wait, the molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so the two substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent could be a single carbon group, like a methyl or something. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero. No, because it's di-substituted, so both must have substituents.

Wait, but wait. Wait, aromatic rings can have substituents like -X (halogens), -COOR (like a ketone or ester), or other groups. Let's think about the IR data. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group. So, there's a C=O somewhere. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.). 

So, the two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen and a carbonyl-containing group. Let's see: benzene rings with substituents like Cl and another group with a carbonyl.

Wait, but the total is 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so substituents have 2 carbons in total. So, substituents are probably Cl (0 carbons) and another group with two carbons. Or one substituent has two carbons and the other has none. Wait, but di-substituted means two groups. So, maybe one substituent is a Cl (0 carbons) and the other is, say, an acetyl group (like -COCH
