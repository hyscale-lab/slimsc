Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about pion decay. Hmm, let's see what it's asking.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion at rest decays. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, right? So, the pion is initially stationary.

The given data: the rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The options give pairs of kinetic energies for the products.

I remember that in particle decay problems, especially when the parent is at rest, you can use conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That means they have the same magnitude of momentum.

Let's think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c². After decay, the total energy is the sum of energies of the muon and neutrino. Since the neutrino is massless (or nearly so), its energy is just |p|c. The muon's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, but wait no, actually, the muon's energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy, but more accurately, the total energy is gamma times its rest energy. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to consider the invariant mass.

Wait, another approach: the invariant mass squared is the sum of the four-momenta of the products. Alternatively, since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, their momenta are the same in magnitude.

Let me denote the magnitude of their momentum as p. So, the muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c², but I might be messing up the units here. Since we're working in MeV, perhaps I can ignore the c's for simplicity, as long as I'm consistent.

Wait, let's write the equations properly. The total energy before decay is m_pi c². After decay, the muon's total energy is E
