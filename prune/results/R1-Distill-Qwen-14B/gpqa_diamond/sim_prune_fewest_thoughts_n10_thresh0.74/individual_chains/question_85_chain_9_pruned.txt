Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. Both detection methods, transit and radial velocity, have been used. The star has certain properties: mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are A to D, with numbers like 0.98, 1.3, 0.53, 1.05. So I need to find T1/T2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, assuming it's a black body. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. But wait, since both planets have the same albedo, that term cancels out when taking the ratio.

So, the formula for equilibrium temperature (Te) is:

Te = Te_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) )

Because the albedo is the same, it doesn't affect the ratio. So the Te ratio is sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) ?

Wait, no. Let me write it again. The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, the star's radius, and the planet's orbital distance (a). The formula is:

Te = Te*sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) )

Wait, actually, I think the formula is Te = Te* * sqrt( (R_star / a) ) * ( (1 - A) / (4) )^0.25. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this right.

No, the general formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:

Te = T_star * ( (R_star / (2 a) ) )^(1/2) * ( (
