Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's give it a shot.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let's draw that structure mentally. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is like an allyl group attached. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)-, wait no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)-? No, wait. Let me think. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2-CH-CH2 where the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is at position 2, so the group is CH2-CH2-CH2? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond from 1 to 2. Oh, so it's CH2=CH-CH2- ? No, wait. Wait, no. The formula for propene is C3H6. Prop-1-en-2-yl is the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, but that's the prop-1-en-2-yl group? So, attach it to the cyclohexane ring at position 5 as CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Wait,
