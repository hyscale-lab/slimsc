Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can get a little tricky for me. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, and the answer is one of them.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, you form the acetate ion. The reaction would be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

But before that, let's figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. When we dilute it to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Oh yeah, 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ water, total volume is 40 cm³. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

So, how much NaOH is added at 25%? Let's calculate the number of moles of acetic acid initially. It's 0.001 moles, as I found earlier. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. Since NaOH is a strong base, each mole reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So the moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 moles.

Now, the volume of NaOH added can be found since the concentration is 0.1 M. Volume = moles / concentration. So 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. But wait, do I need the volume for this part? Hmm, maybe not yet. Let me think about the solution.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So the solution will be a buffer solution containing both CH3COOH and CH3COO^-.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation comes into play here. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). The pKa is -log(Ka), so for 1.85e-5, let's compute that. Let me approximate: log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is about 4.733 (since 5 - 0.267 is 4.733). Wait, no, wait: log(1.8
