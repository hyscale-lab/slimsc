Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to find out which mutation would eliminate this compound by disrupting the gene responsible.

The gene structure is given: five exons and four introns. The wild-type gene sequence is provided, along with four mutants. Each mutant has some changes in the first exon area. The options are Mutant 1 to 4, and I have to choose which one would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, so the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized because the gene is functional. If we can disrupt the gene, the compound won't be made. So we're looking for a mutation that causes a loss-of-function in this gene.

Looking at how mutations affect genes, typically, a frameshift or a nonsense mutation would disrupt the protein product, leading to a nonfunctional gene. Alternatively, a missense mutation might change an amino acid, but that might not necessarily disrupt function unless it's in a critical region. Also, if the mutation is in a splice site or disrupts splicing, that could cause issues, but the question says the changes are in the first exon, which is part of the coding region probably.

Looking at each mutant:

Wild-type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So looking at the changes: The wild-type has TTTCTCGCTG. Mutant 1 has TTCTACGCTG. Wait, let me compare:

Wild: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTA...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTA...

Wait, I think I should line them up:

Wild: positions 4-12 maybe: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TC

Mutant1: TTCTACGCTGGTACT... Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compare each base. Let me write the wild and mutant sequences:

Wild: ATG TTT CTG CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Wait, perhaps I should look for where the mutations are.

Wait, in the first exon, so all these changes are in exons. Exons are the coding regions, so any mutation here will change the amino acids.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: The sequence changes at the fourth position from T to C. Let me see:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT ... Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for where the changes are.

Wait, the wild-type's first part is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant1 is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So comparing:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT CAG C TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me do it step by step.

The wild-type has a segment: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...

Mutant1 has: TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...

So the change is at position 4: wild is T, mutant is C? Or maybe the change is at position 5. Let me count the letters.

Wild:

Positions:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: C
10: G
11: C
12: T
13: G
14: G
15: T
16: A
17: C
18: T
19: T
20: C
21: T
22: G
23: T
24: G
25: G
26: A
27: T
28: G
29: A
30: A
31: C
32: A
33: T
34: A
35: T
36: T
37: A
38: T
39: T
40: G
41: T
42: C
43: G
44: T
45: G
46: T
47: G
... etc.

Wait, perhaps that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, look for the point of mutation.

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So the wild starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant1 has ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

So the first part is:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT...

Wait, perhaps the mutation is a substitution at position 7. Let me see: the 6th base of wild is T, 7th is C (since it's TTTCTC...). Wait, perhaps the exact nucleotide changes are elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution leads to a premature stop codon. Because if the reading frame shifts, that would cause a frameshift leading to a shorter protein. But looking at the sequences, I don't see insertions or deletions, so it's substitutions.

So for each mutant, I need to see if the substitution leads to a stop codon (nonsense mutation) or changes the amino acid in a way that disrupts the protein.

Alternatively, in the first exon, if the mutation is in a critical region, such as the start codon or early exons, it could cause a nonfunctional protein.

But looking at the start codon: all mutants start with ATG, same as wild-type. So no
