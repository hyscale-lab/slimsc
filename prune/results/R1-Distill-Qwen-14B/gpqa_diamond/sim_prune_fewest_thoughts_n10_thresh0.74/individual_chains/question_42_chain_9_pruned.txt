Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to recall what I know. 

The question says that there are three planets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3, with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe the method isn't affecting the way I calculate the orbital periods.

The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by 1.4 times, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 2.3 times. Wait, does that mean Planet3 is colder than Planet2 by a factor of 2.3? So Planet3's equilibrium temperature would be Planet2's temperature divided by 2.3, right?

The mass ratios are also given. The mass of Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is more massive than Planet3. So masses are M1 > M2 > M3.

The problem is asking about the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. So we need to find P3 / P1.

They also mention that the albedo is the same for all three planets, 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo affects how much light is reflected, so it's part of the equilibrium temperature equation.

I think the equilibrium temperature of a planet can be calculated using the formula:

Te = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16πσ D^2) ) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star.

Wait, but in this problem, the star's luminosity is the same for all three planets since they're orbiting the same star, I assume. So L is constant for all.

So the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance D from the star. Let me rearr
