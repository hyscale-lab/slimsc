Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for a given spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are like the average value you'd expect to measure in an experiment, right?

The spin state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector. I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are represented as column vectors in a two-dimensional space because electrons have spin-1/2. So, the state is |ψ> = [3i; 4]. 

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by the operator, multiplied by the state again. So, formula-wise, it's <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix. Oh right, because the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ, so S_y would be (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, wait, so the Pauli matrices. The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Right, so σ_y is:

0   -i
i    0

So, to find the expectation value, I first need to compute ψ† σ_y ψ. Let's break that down step by step.

First, ψ is the column vector [3i; 4]. The conjugate transpose ψ† would be the row vector [ -3, 4* ]? Wait, wait, 3i becomes -3i* because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? Or wait, wait, 3i's complex conjugate is -3i? Because 3i is 3 times i, so the conjugate is 3*(-i), which is -3i. So ψ† would be [-3i, 4]. Wait, no. Because the original vector is [3i; 4], so when you take the conjugate transpose, each component's conjugate becomes the row. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 is real, so remains 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The original vector is (3i, 4), which is a column vector. So when I take the conjugate transpose, each element is conjugated and then transposed. So the first element is 3i, its conjugate is -3i, so the row vector becomes [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the next step is to multiply ψ† by σ_y. So ψ† is a 1x2 matrix and σ_y is 2x2. Let's write that multiplication out.

ψ† σ_y = [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Let me compute that matrix product.

The first element of the resulting 1x2 matrix would be:

(-3i)*(0) + (4)*(i) = 0 +4i =4i.

The second element would be:

(-3i)*(-i) + (4)*(0) = (3i^2) + 0. Wait, wait. (-3i)*(-i) is 3i^2, but i^2 is -1, so that's 3*(-1) = -3. So the second element is -3.

Wait, let me calculate that again. So (-3i) multiplied by (-i) is 3i^2. i^2 is -1, so that's 3*(-1) = -3. So yes, the second term is -3.

So the product ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, matrix multiplication is (row times column). So the first element is row 1 of ψ† times column 1 of σ_y.

ψ† is [ a, b ] where a = -3i, b=4.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So element (1,1) of the product is a*0 + b*i = (4 * i) → 4i.

Element (1,2) is a*(-i) + b*0 → (-3i)*(-i) + 0 = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So the product is the row vector [4i, -3].

Then, I need to multiply this by ψ, which is the column vector [3i;4].

So the expectation value is [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i; 4].

Calculating that:

4i * 3i + (-3)*4.

Let me compute each term. 

First term: 4i *3i = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: (-3) *4 = -12.

So adding them up: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but that's just the number, but remember that S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this result. So <S_y> = (ħ/2)*(-24).

Wait, that would make it -12ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have -12ħ. Oh wait, the options have factors over 25. Hmmm. Did I make a mistake? Let me check my calculations again.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the step where I multiplied ψ† σ_y by ψ.

Wait, let's go back. ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3], and ψ is [3i;4].

So the multiplication is [4i, -3] * [3i, 4]^T.

So:

First element: 4i *3i = 12 i^2 = -12.

Second element: -3 *4 = -12.

Adding these gives -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the result of ψ† σ_y ψ is -24.

But wait, S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

But looking at the options:

Option A is -12 ħ /25. Hmm, but my result is -12 ħ, not divided by anything.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, perhaps the state isn't normalized. Oh, wait—when computing expectation values, if the state isn't normalized, you have to divide by the norm. Oh wait, but the state given is (3i,4), but perhaps I should check if it's normalized.

The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. So the state is not normalized, but in expectation value calculation, does that matter?

Wait, the expectation value formula is <ψ| O |ψ> divided by <ψ|ψ> if the state isn't normalized, right? Because expectation values are given by (ψ† O ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ) for unnormalized states.

Oh right! Because the expectation value is ⟨ψ | O | ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ | ψ⟩. So in this case, I forgot that the state might not be normalized. So I have to normalize it in the expectation value calculation.

So let me compute the norm squared: |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So to normalize, the state is |ψ⟩ = (1/5) [3i;4].

So when calculating the expectation value, I have to compute (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ).

Wait, but wait, in my initial calculation, I took ψ as [3i;4], but perhaps that's not normalized. So when computing the expectation value, I should first normalize the state.

Alternatively, perhaps the expectation value is (ψ† (σ_y) ψ) multiplied by (ħ/2), and then divided by the norm squared.

Wait, let me re-calculate everything correctly.

The state is [3i;4], which is not normalized. Let's compute ψ† ψ, which is (3i)^* *3i + 4^* *4.

(3i)* is -3i, so (-3i)(3i) = -9 i² = -9*(-1) = 9.

4* is 4, so 4*4=16.

So ψ† ψ = 9 +16 =25.

So the norm is 5. So the normalized state is (1/5)* [3i;4].

So now, the expectation value is ( (1/5)(3i;4)† σ_y (1/5)(3i;4) ) multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, but wait, in the formula, the expectation value for S_y is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

So the expectation value of σ_y is given by (ψ† σ_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ).

Which is (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (25) because ψ† ψ is 25.

So let's compute ψ† σ_y ψ again, but this time considering the normalization.

Wait, but earlier I found that ψ† σ_y ψ is -24. So if I divide that by 25, I get -24/25.

Then, multiply by (ħ/2) to get the expectation value of S_y.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) ) = (-12 ħ) /25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25. So the correct answer should be option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for the given spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli y-matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \psi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \psi \), and \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) ensures normalization.

3. **Conjugate Transpose of \( \psi \)**: The conjugate transpose of \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) is:
   \[
   \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) to normalize the state:
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \psi = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   The norm of \( \psi \) is \( \sqrt{25} = 5 \), so the normalized state is \( \frac{1}{5} \psi \).

5. **Matrix Multiplication**: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \):
   - First, \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \):
     \[
     \psi^\dagger \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \( \psi \):
     \[
     \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = -12 - 12 = -24.
     \]

6. **Expectation Value**: Substitute into the formula:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

7. **Final Answer**: Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \text{A) } -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

Answer: A
