Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with cyclohexanone. I remember cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The first reaction is treating it with bromine, which forms product 1. Hmm, what does bromine do to ketones? Oh right, in the presence of a ketone, bromine can undergo a nucleophilic addition. Wait, or is it an enolate formation? Oh wait, no, when a ketone reacts with bromine, it's usually a halogenation. Oh right, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) get brominated. So cyclohexanone has alpha carbons at the positions next to the carbonyl group. So adding Br2 would add a bromine to one of those carbons.

Wait, how does that work? Oh, right, the enolate formation. The base (like in some conditions) deprotonates the alpha hydrogen, making an enolate which then attacks Br2. But wait, in this case, the reaction is just with Br2. Oh, maybe it's an addition reaction. Wait, no, I think bromine in this case would abstract a hydrogen from the alpha position, leading to a bromide substitution. Or perhaps it's a di-substitution if two hydrogens are abstracted.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When a ketone reacts with bromine in a non-polar solvent, like maybe CCl4, it's a typical alpha bromination. So cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha positions (each adjacent to the carbonyl has two C-H bonds), but wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with the carbonyl as a substituent. So the carbonyl is at, say, position 1. Then positions 2 and 6 are the alpha positions. So each of these positions has two hydrogen atoms. But because the ring is symmetric, the two alpha positions are identical. So when Br2 adds, it would add to one of these positions, right?

Wait, but wait. How does the bromine add? Let me think: when a ketone is treated with bromine, it's typically an electrophilic addition. The carbonyl oxygen is a good leaving group? No, wait, in an enol formation. Oh, right, the enol form of the ket
