Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, but here N is 1, so substituting:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond (another 1), and an amine or something else (but wait, the formula includes N, so perhaps an amine group or an amide or nitro? The NMR data might help with that.)

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H). That's a pretty high ppm, likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So there's probably an aldehyde group.

6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H). This looks like aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Because a doublet for two protons suggests they are adjacent to one other proton each, but wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are typically a doublet of doublets. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but more likely in a substituent like a vinyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, the triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde. So perhaps the compound has a benzaldehyde part.

Let me see the other peaks. 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H). Another set of aromatic protons. So maybe two different sets of aromatic protons. How does that fit?

Then 6.27 (broad singlet, 2H). Broad singlet, so maybe some exchangeable protons, like -OH groups. But wait, in the molecule, there's an N. If there's an amide or something else with NH protons, but the NMR doesn't show a peak around 7-8 ppm for that. Alternatively, maybe it's OH protons from phenol groups. But in the molecular formula, there's an O as well. So maybe there are two phenol groups or some other oxygen-containing groups.

Then 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H). That's a quartet or doublet, maybe for CH2 groups adjacent to something else, perhaps an electronegative atom like oxygen. So maybe a CH2-O structure.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzaldehyde group, a phenyl group, and some other substituents. Let's think.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count: Benzene rings would account for 6 carbons. Then perhaps a CH2 group and another group with a carbonyl. Wait, the aldehyde is a carbonyl. So maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde attached to another benzene via a chain that includes an oxygen and a nitrogen.

Wait, but the NMR has a triplet at 9.72 which is the aldehyde. Then the 6.98 and 6.51 could be two different aromatic systems. For example, a para-substituted benzene (like a phenyl group) and another aromatic group, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: maybe the compound is a diaryl ketone or amide, but with some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let me think of possible structures. Let's count: For two benzene rings (each 6 C) would be 12, but wait, no, the formula is only C8, so that can't be. Oh wait, maybe it's a single benzene ring with substitu
