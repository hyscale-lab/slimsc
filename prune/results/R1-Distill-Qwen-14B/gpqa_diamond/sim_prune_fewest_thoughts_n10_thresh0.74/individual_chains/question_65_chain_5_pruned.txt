Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving a different reaction. I need to figure out the major products for each and select the correct option from A to D.

First, looking at reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is reacting with THF, KH, and H+. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ might be a proton source, maybe for workup.

So, the starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, in this case, the oxygen. The structure is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached to the spiro center. The compound is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, which means the spiro rings are a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring. Wait, no, wait. The [3.5] indicates the sizes of the two rings attached to the oxygen. So the first ring is 3 carbons, and the other is 5. So it's a bicyclic structure with a bridge or something else?

Wait, no. Spiro compounds have two rings joined at a single atom. So, for spiro[3.5], it's a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring connected at one atom. So the molecule would look like two rings, one with 3 carbons (excluding the spiro atom) and the other with 5, connected at the same atom, which is also the position where the hydroxyl group and the vinyl group are attached.

The reaction conditions are THF, which is a solvent, and KH. I think KH is a strong base, so maybe deprotonating something. But wait, the structure has an alcohol (OH) group. So in the presence of a strong base like KH, the OH could be deprotonated to form an alkoxide.

But after that, what happens? The solvent is THF, and then H+ is added, perhaps as
