Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about isomers and some properties of specific compounds. Hmm, I'll take it slow.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which compound does not show tautomerism.

Wait, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, right? Like in keto-enol tautomerism. So which of these compounds can't do that?

Benzoquinone... I remember that quinones are cyclic ketones. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups in a benzene ring. So they are conjugated, which is why they can participate in certain reactions. But can they tautomerize? I think quinones can show keto-enol tautomerism. Because the structure has ketones adjacent to each other, allowing for the shift.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the ring has ketones opposite each other. Wait, but can this compound undergo keto-enol tautomerism? Well, for enol formation, you typically need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. But in this trione, each carbonyl is at every other position. Let me visualize the structure. Each ketone is at 1,3,5, so each is adjacent to two other carbonyls. So, the alpha positions are all between carbonyls. Wait, that would mean that each alpha carbon is next to two ketones. So, would that even have any hydrogens to lose? Because if each alpha carbon is a bridge between two carbonyl groups, maybe they don't have any hydrogens. Let me think: the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O. So each of the middle carbons (2,4,6) is connected to two oxygen double bonds. Wait, no, that's not possible. Because in a six-membered ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. Oh wait, wait. Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. Each of the 1,3,5 positions has a carbonyl group. So the structure is 1,3,5-trione. So the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O... Wait, no. Let's see: the ring is six carbons, with carbonyls on 1,3,5. So the positions 2,4,6 are each connected between two carbonyls. So each of those positions is a CH2 group? No, wait, in a six-membered ring, each carbon is connected to two others. So if 1 is O=C-O, then the adjacent carbons (2 and 6) would each have a single bond. So, the structure at each position is: 1 is O=C-CH2-; 3 is O=C-CH2-; 5 is O=C-CH2-. So each of the middle positions (2,4,6) is a CH2 group.
