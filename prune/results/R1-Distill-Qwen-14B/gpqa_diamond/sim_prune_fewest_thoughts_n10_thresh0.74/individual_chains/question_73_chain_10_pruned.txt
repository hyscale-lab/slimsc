Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So the first thing I need to do is figure out their relative speed from one astronaut's frame of reference. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just simple subtraction, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add or subtract their velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for the relative velocity u' when observing from one frame (say, the frame of the first astronaut) is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, I need to make sure I'm getting the directions right. Both are moving in the positive x-direction, so from the first astronaut's perspective, the second is moving at a certain speed in the same direction, but since both are moving at a fraction of c, I have to apply the formula correctly.

So let's plug in the numbers. The first astronaut's speed v1 is 0.6c, and the second's v2 is 0.5c. So the relative speed u' would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So that's negative, which makes sense because the second astronaut is moving slower in the same direction from the first's frame. But wait, maybe the question is asking for the magnitude? Or is it just the relative speed regardless of direction? The options might help, but I'm not sure yet.

Denominator: 1 - ((0.6c)(0.5c))/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c
