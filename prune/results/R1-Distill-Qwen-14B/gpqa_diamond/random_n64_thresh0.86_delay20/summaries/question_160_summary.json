The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \\( J_1 \\). The first two minima occur at angles corresponding to the first and second zeros of \\( J_1 \\), which are approximately 3.8317 and 7.0156, respectively. Using the small-angle approximation, the angular separation between these minima is calculated to be approximately \\( 0.506 \\lambda / a \\), corresponding to option D.\n\nAnswer: D"
