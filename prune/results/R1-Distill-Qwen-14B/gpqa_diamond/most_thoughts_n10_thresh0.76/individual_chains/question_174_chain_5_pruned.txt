Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We're supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Okay, let's note down the given information:

- Initial rest mass energy of nucleus: E_initial = 300 GeV.
- The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum is zero.
- After fission, two fragments: one mass is 2 times the other. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. So m1 = 2*m2.
- Sum of rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Since M is the initial mass, but wait, the initial rest mass is given as 300 GeV, which is M c², right? But wait, perhaps M here is the rest mass in some units. Well, maybe it's better to treat M as the rest mass, so M c² = 300 GeV. But perhaps in this problem, units are in energy terms, so M is the rest mass energy divided by c², but maybe it's easier to think in terms of masses as fractions of M.

Wait, let me clarify: the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Since m1 = 2 m2, substituting, 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. So m2 = 0.33 M, m1=0.66 M.

Wait, but let me check: 0.66 + 0.33 is 0.99, yes. So the two fragments have rest masses of 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

But wait, the initial rest mass is 0.99 M, right? Because the initial nucleus's rest mass is M, and the sum after is 0.99 M. So that means that the total rest mass has decreased by 1% (since 99% of M is 0.99 M). So that 1% must have been converted into kinetic energy of the fragments and any other forms of energy, but the problem says the nucleus splits into two fragments and nothing else. So all the released energy goes into kinetic energy. Wait, but the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1.

So in the rest frame of the initial nucleus (since it's at rest before fission), the two fragments will move in opposite directions due to conservation of momentum. Because the initial momentum is zero, the total
