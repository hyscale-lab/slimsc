Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

So, the problem is about two electrons in p orbitals. Wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 and l2, both equal to 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait. I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, the total l can range from |l1-l2| to l1+l2. So 1 + 1 is 2, and the minimum is 0, but here it's 2. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>. That makes sense because l can be 0,1,2 in this coupling.

The question is about measuring L1z and L2z, the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -침. So each would measure -침. I think, because for an angular momentum operator, the eigenvalues are m * 침, right? So m is -1 here for each Lz component?

Wait, but wait, each electron's orbital angular momentum has l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So for L1z, the eigenvalues are m1 * 침 where m1 is -1, 0, +1. Same for L2z.

So the state is |1,1,2,-1>. But wait, this is a coupled state, combining the individual angular momenta. Let me recall how states are coupled. The coupled state is a combination of the product states of the individual states.

Wait, but when you have two particles, the total angular momentum state |l1, l2, l, m> is a linear combination of the product states |m1, m2>, where m1 + m2 = m. So the given state is |1,1,2,-1>. So m for the total is -1. But each electron has individual m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1.

So for the state |1,1,2,-
