Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data for this compound from the given options.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. First, I'll think about the structure based on the given information.

So, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, right? Because it's a 6-membered aromatic ring. Di-substituted means two substituents are attached to the benzene ring. The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Wait, benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the benzene ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents are attached to it. So if the molecule has 8 carbons in total, then the substituents contribute 2 carbons.

Wait, that's not possible because substituents like -Cl or -NO2 don't contribute any carbons. So maybe the substituents are something else. Wait, but wait, FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So there's a carbonyl group, probably as a substituent on the benzene, and a halogen attached as another substituent.

Wait, but benzene can't have a carbonyl as a substituent unless it's part of a larger group. For example, maybe a ketone, like an acetyl group (COCH3), or an aldehyde (CHO), but aldehyde would require more carbons.

Wait, but the substituents have to contribute 2 carbons because 6 (benzene) + 2 = 8. So each substituent is one carbon? Because two substituents on benzene would add two carbons. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has 8 carbons. Benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents must account for 2 carbons in total. Let's see. One substituent is a carbonyl group. So let's think, a carbonyl group could be part of a ketone, like RCO-, or maybe an aldehyde, RCHO. But aldehyde has a CHO group which is one substituent, but that's only one carbon. Wait, but wait, a ketone is RCO-. For example, if one substituent is a ketone, like a propanone group, but that would require more carbons.

Wait another approach: maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Like, for example, benzene with a -CO- group and a -X, where X is halogen. But wait, if X is
