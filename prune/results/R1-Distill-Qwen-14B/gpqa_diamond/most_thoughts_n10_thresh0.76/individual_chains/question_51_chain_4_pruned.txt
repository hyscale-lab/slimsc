Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, the question says: if a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R, what's the net potential energy of the system?

Wait, I remember that when dealing with potential energy in electrostatics, it's often about the work done to assemble the charges. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here.

So, the setup: there's a conducting sphere, which is grounded. Grounded means it's connected to the earth, so any excess charge can flow to or from the earth. Conducting spheres have some nice properties; the charge resides on the surface. Now, when another charge is brought near, it induces charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded. So when I place charge q near it, the sphere's induced charges can adjust because it's connected to ground. Oh right, for a grounded conductor, the potential on the surface is zero. So the conductor will have induced charges such that the potential on its surface is zero.

Hmm, the system's potential energy... I think the potential energy here would be the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere, plus the work done in assembling the induced charges on the sphere. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, maybe that part is already taken care of, or maybe the potential is set to zero.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy U of the system is the sum of the potential energy due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But
