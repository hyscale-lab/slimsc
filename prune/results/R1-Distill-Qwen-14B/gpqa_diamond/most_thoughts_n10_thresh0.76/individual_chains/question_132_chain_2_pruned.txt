Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR problem. Let's see... The question says that there's a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR has two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. Hmm, I need to figure out which two compounds are present.

First, let's break down the molecular formula. C10H14. For benzene rings, the general formula is C6H6. So each compound has 4 more carbons (since 10-6=4). Those 4 carbons are probably methyl groups because they're common substituents.

Wait, but 4 carbons could also be ethyl groups. Like maybe two ethyl groups, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The aromatic region shows two singlets at around 6.7 ppm. That's a bit downfield for benzene, so maybe substitution is affecting it. Singlets mean no neighboring protons. So each of these signals must be from equivalent protons with no adjacent Hs.

In disubstituted benzene rings, certain substituents can cause the aromatic protons to be deshielded. For example, para substituents can lead to specific splitting patterns. Wait, but if each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, then each has four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So, each compound is C6H6 plus four methyl groups (each CH3). Wait, four methyl groups would add 4*3=12 H, but the formula is C10H14. Let me calculate: C6 + 4(CH3) = C10H(6 + 12) = C10H18. But the formula given is C10H14. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Oh, wait, maybe the compounds have some other substituents, like ethyl groups instead of all methyl.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. The molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So
