Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down. The question is about finding the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. Hmm.

Alright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as unit vectors. Let me check the norm. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The squared magnitude would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. That's important because we'll need to normalize it for probabilities.

So the state vector is |Ïˆ> = 1/sqrt(6) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes, this normalization is necessary.

Now, the operators for P and Q are given as matrices. Let me write them down.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: [1, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -1]

Wait, Q looks like a diagonal matrix. So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. That makes sense because the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, or -1.

When measuring Q, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are calculated by the square of the components of the state vector in the corresponding eigenstates.

But wait, since this is a product of two measurements, I need to find the probability of getting P=0 first, then Q=-1.

Wait, no, the question says: measure Q just after the measurement of P. So the process is: measure P, then measure Q. But wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Oh, no, wait, the question says: what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

Wait, does that mean that P is measured first, resulting in 0,
