Okay, so I have this genetics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So the problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they sequenced the target gene in all mutants. Some changes are in the first exon area. The question is asking which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, so I remember that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) is a mutagen that primarily causes point mutations, usually leading to base substitutions. It doesn't cause large deletions or insertions, so the mutations here are probably point changes.

Looking at the intact gene and the mutants:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCT...
Mutant 2: ...TAAGCT...
Mutant 3: ...TTTACGCT...
Mutant 4: ...ACTTCTGT...

Wait, let me write out the changes in each mutant more clearly.

The first part of the gene sequence is the same in all mutants except for a few changes.

For Mutant 1:
The sequence changes from ...TTCTCGCT... in the intact gene to ...TTCTACGCT... So the part after TTCT changes from CGCT to AC. Wait, no, let me look again.

Wait, the intact gene has a segment: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant 1: TCTACGCT. So the original part is CTTCTCGCT (maybe?), wait no, perhaps the change is in the second exon? Or perhaps the first exon. The question says the changes are in the first exon, so all mutations are in the first exon.

Wait, the problem says the changes are in the first exon area. So all the mutations are in the first exon.

The first exon in the intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT...

So the first mutation in each is in the beginning of the sequence.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Compare to intact:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the change is in the sixth and seventh nucleotides? Let me count: the first part is ATG TTT CTCGCT...

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compare each mutant's sequence to the intact.

Let me write the intact gene's first part for easier comparison.

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1:
ATG TCT ACG CT
