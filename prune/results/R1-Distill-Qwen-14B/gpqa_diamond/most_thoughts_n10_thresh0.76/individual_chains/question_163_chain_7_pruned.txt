Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we have to find out the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid required to do this. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A through D, each giving a pH and a volume.

First, I think I should figure out the reaction that happens when Fe(OH)3 is treated with a strong acid. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I believe. So when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl, it should form Fe^3+ ions and water. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so we're going to need enough acid to dissolve it. Since it's a neutralization reaction, the moles of H+ ions (from the acid) should equal three times the moles of Fe(OH)3, right?

So first, calculating the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH- is 17 g/mol (16 from O and 1 from H). So 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol, approximately 9.358e-4 mol.

Since the reaction uses 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

But the acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter (1000 cm³). So the volume (V) needed is moles / concentration.

Volume = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³... that's very close. So maybe that's the volume. But wait, I should check if I did the math correctly.

Wait, 0.1 g divided by 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.0009358. So 3 times that is 0.0028074 moles of H+.

Then, 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 0.028074 liters → 28.07 cm³. So the volume needed is about 28.07 cm³. The closest option is C) which says 28.05 cm³. So that's probably the volume part.

Now, the pH part. After dissolving Fe(OH)3, what's in solution? Fe^3+ ions and some excess H+ (if any) from the acid.

Wait, but I used the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. Does that mean all the Fe(OH)3 is just dissolved, and there's no excess acid left? Because if I use exactly the stoichiometric amount, there's no excess H+
