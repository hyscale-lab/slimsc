Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2 around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. Now, we need to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii in size, such that both transit and occultation events occur. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm, okay. So what do I remember about transits and occultations? When a planet transits its star, it passes in front of the star from our point of view, blocking some of the star's light. An occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the star blocks the planet's light (if it emits any, but in this case, planets are probably reflecting starlight).

For a transit to happen, the planet's orbit must be aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The impact parameter is the measure of how close the planet's path comes to the center of the star. A lower impact parameter means a closer approach, so a higher chance of a transit. Impact parameter 'b' is given by (distance from star's center to planet's path) / (star's radius). So, when b is small, the planet's path is closer to the star's center, making transits more likely.

Wait, but in this problem, the first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2. Since it transits, that means that 0.2 is the ratio of (distance from star's center to the planet's path) divided by the star's radius. So, if the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, then the distance would be 0.2 * 1.5 solar radii = 0.3 solar radii. So the planet's orbit is such that the closest approach to the star's center is 0.3 solar radii away.

But wait, impact parameter is the perpendicular distance from the star's center to the planet's orbital path. So, for a circular orbit, the planet's orbital radius is directly related to that.

Wait, more accurately, the impact parameter b is the distance at which the planet's path passes closest to the star's center. So, if the planet's orbit is at a distance 'a' from the star's center, and the impact parameter is b, then the planet's path is at a closest approach of b when it transits.

Wait no, actually, the impact parameter is the distance from the star's center to the planet's path at the point of closest approach. So if the planet's orbital radius is 'a', but the path is at a certain angle, then the impact parameter is b = a * sin(i), where i is the inclination. But in this case, since it's a transit, the inclination is 90 degrees, so sin(i) is 1, so b = a. Wait, that's probably incorrect. Because when the planet transits, the orbit is edge-on, so the path is at radius a,
