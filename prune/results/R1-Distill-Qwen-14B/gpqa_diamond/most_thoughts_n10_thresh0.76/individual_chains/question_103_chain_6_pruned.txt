Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me break that down.

Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So the structure would be a phenyl group attached to a ketone. The substituents on the benzene ring are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5. But wait, numbering the benzene ring... if the ketone is at position 1, then the substituents would be at 3 and 5 relative to it. Hmm, so the ring would have a ketone (as a substituent) in the 1 position, bromo in 3, and nitro in 5. Wait, no, because when the benzene ring is attached to the ketone, that's a substituent. So the substituents would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine the benzene ring with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. So the ketone is at position 1, then the bromo is at 3, and nitro at 5. So the substituents are at the meta positions relative to each other?

Wait, perhaps looking at the structure would help. The target is 1-(3
