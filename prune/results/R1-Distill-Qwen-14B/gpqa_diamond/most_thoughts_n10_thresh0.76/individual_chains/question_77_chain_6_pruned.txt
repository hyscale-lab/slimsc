Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm, I need to figure out the major products A and B from the given reactions and choose the correct option among A, B, C, D.

Let me start with reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Wait, that's a mouthful. So, benzene ring with a substituent: an (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl group. Let me draw that structure.

The substituent is OCH2 connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the butenyl chain is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH-, but the numbering is from the other end. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-? Wait, no, wait. The structure of but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no, let me think. But-2-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, starting from the 1 position. So, 1-yl means the substituent is attached to carbon 1. So structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-, but wait, that's but-1-en-4-yl? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct structure for but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should number the chain. So for but-2-en-1-yl, the substituent is on carbon 1, the double bond is between 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-CH2- but wait, that can't be. No, wait
