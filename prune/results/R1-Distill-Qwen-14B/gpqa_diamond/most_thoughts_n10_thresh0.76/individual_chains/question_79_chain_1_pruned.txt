Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a compound X (C11H12O) after a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what X was from the options provided.

First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Wurtz reaction, which is a type of elimination reaction. It typically deoxygenates epoxides to form alkenes. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh wait, wait. The Wurtz reaction usually involves the reaction of an alkoxide with another alkoxide, leading to the formation of an alkane and elimination of the oxide. But wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, another possibility is that the reagent is a strong base, and under certain conditions, it can cause an elimination reaction, like deprotonation leading to the formation of a double bond. So perhaps the compound X is an epoxide that upon treatment with this strong base forms an alkene. So the product would be an alkene, and the starting material would be an epoxide.

Looking at the options, all of them involve oxirane rings, which are epoxides. So the reaction is converting an epoxide to an alkene, which would remove the oxygen. So the product should have an alkene where the epoxide was. So the product has a double bond, and the starting material (compound X) has an epoxide.

Wait, but the question says the product is subjected to the reaction. No wait, the question says compound X is subjected to the reaction. Wait, wait, no. Let me read again: "compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day." So X is the starting material, and after the reaction, we get the product. The NMR data given is for the product.

Wait, so the product's NMR is provided. So the reaction is converting X, which is an epoxide, into an alkene. So the product would be an alkene. So I need to figure out the structure of X, which is the epoxide, based on the NMR of the alkene product.

Wait, but the options are for what X is. So I need to find which of the options, when treated with the base, would give the product with the given NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the product and then determine what the epoxide must have been.

Let me look at the NMR data of the product.

The 1H NMR is:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d),
