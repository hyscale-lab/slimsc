Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming both radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the luminosity of a star, assuming it's a black body, depends on both its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then T must be the same. Wait, but wait a minute. Are we talking about the same observed wavelength, or their intrinsic peak wavelengths?

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So if they are moving, could there be a Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength? Oh, right! Because the stars might be moving towards or away from us, which would shift the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect.

So Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Since it's moving towards us (assuming positive is away, but wait, if radial velocity is positive, that's moving away? Or is it the other way around? Wait, usually radial velocity is positive when moving away, so if Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s, perhaps it's moving towards us if it's negative, but the problem states radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s. Wait, I'm not sure about the sign convention here. Oh, but the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Wait, but it's not clear whether it's moving towards or away. Hmm, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So their observed peak wavelengths are the same.

Wait, I think the key here is that the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So even though their intrinsic temperatures might be different, their observed wavelengths are the same because of the Doppler shift. So I need to account for that.

So let's break it down. For each star, the observed peak wavelength is λ_obs. For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so λ1 = λ_max1. For Star_2, the radial velocity is v, so λ2_obs = λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but wait, that's for relativistic Doppler shift. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_max * (1 + v/c), but if v is positive when moving away. Since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), so 700 is 0.00233c, so perhaps we can take the more precise formula.

Wait, but let me think again. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), when the source is moving away from the observer, v is positive. If the source is moving towards the observer, v is negative, so the denominator would be (1 - v/c), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the observed wavelength is given by λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. For a moving source, z can be expressed in terms of velocity. The formula for z is z = v/c, assuming v is much less than c, so the approximation z ≈ v/c holds. But when v is a significant fraction of c, we have to use the exact Doppler formula.

Alternatively, the exact Doppler shift formula when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/(c)) / (1 - v/(c)) )

Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Let me get this right.

If the source is moving away from the observer, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

If the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shifted): λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But wait, the formula can also be written using (1 + z) = (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ), but that's for relativistic speeds, which may not be necessary here since 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light. But perhaps the problem expects us to consider relativistic effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the Doppler
