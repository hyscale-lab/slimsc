Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me try to unpack it.

So the experiment: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they did in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Then they identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. They sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability. What's the process here?

Wait, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen. So when the GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are given orally, some get to the Peyer patches.

The GFP is on the inner capsid, so maybe those proteins are antigens. The immune system would respond to them. The fact that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid suggests that not all antigens make it through, but some do. Those that reach the Peyer patches would be processed by antigen-presenting cells, perhaps.

They isolated proliferating cells from the Peyer patches. Proliferating cells in lymphoid tissues are likely activated B cells or T cells. But the sequencing was done on variable heavy chain genes, so that points towards B cells, specifically B lymphocytes, because heavy chain is part of the B cell receptor (BCR).

High variability in the variable heavy chain genes—so each cell's gene is different. That sounds like diversification. I remember that B cells undergo several processes to diversify their receptors. The main ones are VDJ recombination (which happens during B cell development in the bone marrow) and somatic hypermutation (which occurs during the germinal center reactions, leading to affinity maturation).

Wait, but VDJ recombination is during the early stages, when the B cell is forming its BCR for the first time. Somatic hypermutation happens later, after the B cell is activated, leading to more diversity in the variable region.

In this case, the B cells are in the Peyer patches, which I think are involved in the initial immune response. But Peyer patches are part of the mucosal immune system; they have B cells that can differentiate into plasma cells or remember cells.

So when the rotavirus antigens are presented, the B cells in the Peyer patches would be activated. The high variability in the variable regions suggests that they've undergone some process to increase diversity. So what's happening here?

Somatic hypermutation is a process that introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the BCR genes, leading to more diverse receptors. This process occurs during the germinal center reactions, which are part of the adaptive immune response. It's a way to increase the chances that some B cells will recognize the antigen better, thus improving the immune response.

But wait, VDJ recombination is done during the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow, which produces a diverse initial set of BCRs. So each B cell already has a unique BCR due to VDJ. But when an antigen is encountered, the B cells that recognize it get activated, and then undergo somatic hypermutation to further diversify their receptors, leading to a more specific and stronger response.

In this experiment, the sequencing shows high variability in the variable heavy chains. Since the cells are proliferating in the Peyer patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs, maybe the B cells are undergoing division and activating their immune response. So the process would be somatic hypermutation, as this leads to the high variability observed in the variable regions.

Alternatively, could it be class switching recombination? No, that's when the type of antibody is switched (like from IgM to IgG), but the question is about variable heavy chains, which are part of the antigen-binding site, not the class.

Complement activation—probably not. That's more about opsonizing pathogens or causing lysis, not directly about the variability of the BCR.

VDJ recombination is during initial B cell development, so if these cells were just making their receptors for the first time, but in this case, the B cells are responding to an antigen, so it's after the initial VDJ. So the process here is more likely somatic hypermutation.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence from the GFP-tagged proteins is observed in the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). These patches are specialized for antigen sampling and immune responses to oral antigens. The isolated proliferating cells from the Peyer patches show high variability in their variable heavy chain genes after sequencing.

Peyer patches contain B cells that are activated by antigens like the GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that diversifies the antigen-binding sites of B cell receptors. Somatic hypermutation is a mechanism that introduces point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptor genes during the germinal center reactions, leading to increased diversity and improved antigen recognition. This process occurs after the initial VDJ recombination, which diversifies B cell receptors during early B cell development in the bone marrow.

Other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Complement activation** is not relevant to the variability in B cell receptors.
- **Class switching recombination** alters the antibody isotype but does not affect the variable heavy chain sequence.
- **VDJ recombination** occurs during early B cell development and is not the process responsible for the observed variability in the Peyer patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is consistent with somatic hypermutation, which occurs in activated B cells during the adaptive immune response in secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer patches.

Answer: A
