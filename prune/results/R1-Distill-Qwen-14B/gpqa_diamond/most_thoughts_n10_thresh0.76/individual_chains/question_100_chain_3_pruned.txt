Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the incorrect statement about the products in a reaction sequence. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is an alkene because the formula is CnH2n. For n=3, 2n=6, so it's either propene or another isomer. But in alkanes, C3H8 is propane, so yeah, A is an alkene. So propene (propylene) is CH2=CHCH3.

Then, compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Wait, bromination with CCl4 usually refers to addition across a double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add Br2, but wait, wait. Wait, when alkenes react with bromine (Br2), they undergo an addition reaction. Carbon tetrachloride is a solvent, non-reactive. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? No, wait. Let me think again. Propene has the double bond between C1 and C2. Adding bromine would add Br across the double bond, so it becomes CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base used in elimination reactions. So B is a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent bromines). When a dihalide reacts with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two molecules of HBr and forming an alkene. Wait, but wait: in the case of vicinal dihalides, the reaction with alcoholic KOH (which provides OH- and ROH, but the base is alcoholic), would likely cause an elimination reaction. So the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, so when they lose HBr, they form a double bond.

So for B: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would lose two HBr molecules. The reaction would form an alkene. The possible alkenes are 1-propene (propene) or 2-propene (but that's the same as propene because the double bond is between C1 and C2). Wait, wait
