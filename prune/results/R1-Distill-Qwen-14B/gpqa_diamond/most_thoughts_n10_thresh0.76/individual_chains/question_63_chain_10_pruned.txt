Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given data includes the masses of the atoms, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, the model mentioned is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. But wait, I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed. The non-rigid model allows for some stretching. Oh, but for this problem, maybe the bond length is given as a fixed value, so maybe it's treated as a rigid rotor?

Wait, no, the question says it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so perhaps it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy states. So the molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state, which would be the first vibrational state and the lowest rotational state. But wait, the ground state is typically the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the selection rules). But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational states are quantized, and for a diatomic, the rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. So the ground rotational state is J=0.

So the current state is the vibrational ground state (v=0) and rotational ground state (J=0). The next possible state with the lowest energy would be either the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1).

Wait, what's the energy order here? Vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, and rotational as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. Since ω is much larger than the rotational constant B (because B is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia, and for diatomic molecules, the vibrational frequency is higher), the vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones.
