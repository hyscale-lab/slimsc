Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds and their ability to reach the inner walls of a detector. Hmm.

Alright, let's read the problem again carefully. So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, okay. So the original setup has a Lorentz factor (γ) of 20, and only a third of the particles make it to the walls. But we want two-thirds to reach the walls. So I need to find the γ that would allow that.

I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to decay and whether they have enough time to reach the detector's walls before decaying. Because if they decay quickly, they won't travel far. So the key is probably the particle's lifetime as observed in the lab frame and the distance they need to cover.

In particle physics, the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is multiplied by the Lorentz factor to get the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. So the longer the lifetime (higher γ), the more time the particle has to travel before decaying, which means it can go further.

The distance the particle travels before decaying is given by velocity multiplied by time. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, I can approximate their speed as the speed of light, c. So the distance D is approximately γ * c * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but in the original case, the particles with γ=20 have a third reaching the walls. So why is that? I think it's because not all particles have the same γ; perhaps the distribution varies, but the problem is asking about the average. Or maybe it's a matter of the speed and the decay length.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the probability of the particle decaying before reaching the wall. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying, which is c * γ * τ. So if the decay length is longer than the radius of the detector, more particles will reach the walls.

But the problem says that with γ=20, one third reach the walls. So perhaps the decay length is such that only a third make it. So when we change γ, how does the fraction change?

Wait, maybe it's a matter of the decay length being such that the probability is proportional to (decay length)/(radius). Because the particles are emitted isotropically, the ones that travel a certain distance are captured by the walls if their decay length is longer than the radius. Wait, no, that's not correct because the direction also matters. But maybe the problem is assuming that all particles are moving radially outward, or that the detector is a sphere, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius.

Alternatively, perhaps the idea is that the fraction of particles that reach the walls is roughly proportional to the probability that their decay length is longer than the radius of the detector. So the fraction f is the probability that the decay length L is greater than R.

The decay length L is γ c τ. But in this case, the particles are being produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel before hitting the wall is R. So if L > R, they'll make it; if not, they decay before reaching.

So the fraction f is the probability that L ≥ R. Since the decay is exponential, the probability that the particle's lifetime τ is less than R/(γ c) is 1 - f. So f is the probability that τ ≥ R/(γ c).

Wait, the decay process follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/τ). So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it would take to reach the wall (t=R/(γ c)) is exp(-R/(γ c τ)).

Wait, but wait, because in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is γ τ. So the time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(γ c) because v ≈ c. So the time t is R/(γ c).

The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(γ τ))? Wait, no. Let me think again.

In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is τ' = γ τ. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(- t/(γ τ)).

But the time t is R
