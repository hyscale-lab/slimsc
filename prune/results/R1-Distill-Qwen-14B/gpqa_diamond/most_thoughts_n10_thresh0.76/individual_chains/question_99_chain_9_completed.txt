Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options given are four different structures, all of which seem to have some kind of branching and a carboxylic acid group. So, the target molecule must be one of A, B, C, or D.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H stretches. In this case, the broad peak suggests a carboxylic acid because they have strong, broad O-H absorption. Oh, wait, but there's also a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹, so that fits.

So, the compound definitely has a carboxylic acid group. Now, looking at the structures, all four options end with COOH, except perhaps I need to double-check. No, wait, option A ends with CH2COOH, but that's still a carboxylic acid because it's a -COOH group. So all four have a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR data.

Next, the 1H NMR part. The question says that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, the molecule doesn't have any double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, or at least no vinylic protons. Looking at the options:

All the structures seem to be alkanes with a carboxylic acid. So no double bonds, hence no vinyl H. So that fits.

Now, looking at the NMR signals. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns.

First, in NMR, splitting occurs when neighboring Hs cause splitting. The number of peaks (multiplicity) depends on the number of neighboring Hs. So a doublet is split by one neighboring group, triplet by two, quartet by three, etc.

But when you have more than one neighboring group with different numbers of Hs, the splitting becomes a multiplet that's a combination of the splits. For example, if a proton is next to two different sets of Hs, each with a different number, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but sometimes more complex when the coupling constants are similar or different.

Looking at the options, let's try to figure out each structure and the possible NMR signals.

Let me write out the structures more clearly.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Breaking it down:

The main chain is CH2-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, wait. Structure: The molecule is probably something like CH3CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. So the central part is two CH groups, each attached to two CH3 groups and a central carbon.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me parse each option correctly.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, that's a central carbon with two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 group. So structure is CH3-C(C2H5)(H)-C(C2H5)(H)-CH2-COOH. So the central part is two CH groups, each bearing an ethyl group and a hydrogen.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

So, the structure is CH3CH2-C(C2H5)(H)-C(C2H5)(H)-COOH. So the central part is two CH groups with ethyl substituents, attached to a CH2CH3 group on one side and a COOH on the other.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

That's CH3-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-CH2-COOH. So two CH groups each with methyl substituents, connected to a CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So that's CH3CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. So again, similar to B, but the substituents on the CH groups are methyl groups, and the ethyl group is attached to the first carbon.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to look at the substituents around the central carbons. Let's imagine each molecule's structure.

In all options, the carboxylic acid is at one end, and the rest is a branched chain.

Let me think about the possible NMR signals.

In each structure, the central carbons (the ones attached to the COOH) have two CH groups. Each of these CH groups has nearby substituents.

For example, in option D:

The structure is CH3-CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH.

So, around the central two CH groups. The CH2 group is attached to one CH, and the COOH is attached to the other.

The CH groups each have a CH3 attached and a H. So, the H on each of these CH groups would be in a certain environment.

Wait, but let's think about the neighboring Hs. The Hs on each CH group would be split by neighboring Hs.

So, for each CH group, what Hs are near?

In option D, the CH groups are attached to a CH2 and a COOH group. The H on each CH would be next to the CH2 group's Hs and possibly the other CH's Hs.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider each CH group and the neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR signals correspond to specific environments of Hs.

Looking at the NMR description: one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, another is a doublet of triplet of triplets.

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let's think about how splitting works. Suppose a proton has two neighboring groups: one with two Hs, another with three Hs.

If a proton is split by two different neighboring groups, the splitting would be more complex.

For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 group (two Hs) and a CH group (one H), the splitting would be a triplet (for the CH2) and then each of those would split into a doublet, making a triplet of doublets. But in reality, the actual splitting depends on the coupling constants and the order in which the splits occur.

Wait, the splitting order is determined by the number of neighboring Hs. So if a proton is next to a CH2 (2 Hs) and another CH (1 H), the splitting would be first into a triplet (from the CH2), and each of those would be split into a doublet (from the CH). So the pattern would be a triplet of doublets, which would be 2×3 = 6 peaks. But depending on the coupling constants, it might be a doublet of triplets, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the CH groups in the molecule has a certain number of neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a structure where a CH group is next to a CH2 and another CH group. Let me try to outline.

Take option D: the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the middle part: the first CH2 (CH3CH2-) is attached to a CH group (C(H)(CH3)), which is attached to another CH group (C(H)(CH3)), which is attached to COOH.

Each CH group has a CH3 and a H. The H on each CH would be adjacent to the Hs on the neighboring CH groups and any CH2 groups nearby.

Wait, the first CH2 group has two Hs. The next CH has one H. The next CH has another H, and then the COOH.

So, the H on the first CH2 (CH2CH3) would be split by the adjacent CH (which has one H). So, that would give a triplet for the CH2 Hs, but wait, the CH2 is next to a CH. So each H on the CH2 would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, giving a doublet for each. But since the CH2 has two Hs, they are equivalent and would split into a triplet? Wait, no, the CH2 is next to a single H (on the adjacent CH). So each H on the CH2 would couple with that single H, leading to a doublet. But since the two Hs on CH2 are equivalent, their splitting would be a doublet. So the CH2 group's Hs would be a doublet.

But that's just one part. Let's see. The Hs on the CH groups: each CH is attached to a CH2 and a COOH group (or another CH). Wait, no, each CH is attached to the previous group and the next group.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the substituents near each H.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting in the NMR is due to coupling with multiple non-equivalent neighboring Hs.

Let me think about the possible structures and their NMR signals.

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the H on the CH2 (CH3CH2-) is adjacent to the CH (C(H)(CH3)) group. The H on the CH group is adjacent to the CH2 and the other CH group.

Wait, the H on the first CH (from the COOH side) is attached to a CH3 and a CH2 group. The H on the CH2 is adjacent to the first CH.

Similarly, the H on the other CH (the one attached to the CH2) is adjacent to the CH2 and the other CH.

Wait, perhaps the central CH groups each have two different types of neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a structure where each CH group has multiple coupling partners.

Wait, perhaps the two CH groups are adjacent to each other, so each has a neighboring H on the other CH, plus any other Hs nearby.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting in the NMR comes from more than one set of neighboring Hs.

Wait, the problem says that in the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplet of triplets.

Hmm, that's a complex splitting. Let me think about how that could happen.

Suppose a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring Hs. For example, one neighboring group has two Hs, another has three Hs. Then the splitting could be a triplet of quartets, but the order of splitting could lead to a doublet of triplet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is the result of multiple neighboring groups with different numbers of Hs.

Let me think about a specific example. Suppose a proton is next to a CH2 group (2 Hs) and a CH group (1 H). The first split would be into a triplet (from the CH2), and each of those would be split into a doublet (from the CH). So we'd get a triplet of doublets, which would result in 2×3=6 peaks, but it might also be seen as a doublet of triplets if the splitting order is reversed.

Wait, no, the order of splitting depends on the coupling constants and which group is considered first. If the CH group's H is further away (smaller J), it would split the triplet into a doublet, resulting in a triplet of doublets. Or if the CH2's Hs are closer (larger J), then the doublet would split each peak of the triplet, leading to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps a proton is split by two different groups with 2 and 3 Hs each. Let's say the first split is a triplet (from 2 Hs), then each of those splits into a quartet (from 3 Hs). So it's a triplet of quartets, which would be a quartet of triplets if the order is reversed.

Wait, but the question says one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is a result of each proton being coupled to two different groups, each with multiple Hs.

Another approach: perhaps the structure has a geminal di-substitution, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal di-substitution, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a structure where a CH is attached to two different groups, each with multiple Hs.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct structure has a branching that leads to complex coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH group is next to two different substituents, each with multiple Hs.

Let me think about each option's structure.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So the structure is:

CH3-C(C2H5)(H)-C(C2H5)(H)-CH2-COOH.

Each CH is attached to an ethyl group and a hydrogen. The CH groups are connected to each other, so each has a neighboring CH group (with one H) and a CH2 group (with two Hs) on one side and an ethyl group on the other.

Wait, the CH2 group is at the end, connected to COOH.

So, for the CH groups, each has Hs that are adjacent to the CH2 (two Hs) and the other CH (one H). So each H on the CH would be split by both the CH2 and the other CH.

So, the Hs on the CH groups would have two different coupling partners: one with two Hs (from CH2) and another with one H (from the adjacent CH).

But wait, the CH groups are attached to each other. So each CH's H is next to another CH's H, and perhaps the CH2's Hs.

So, the H on a CH would be coupled with the Hs on the adjacent CH and the Hs on the CH2.

But wait, the CH2 is on the other end, so perhaps the coupling isn't through space for that. Or maybe for vicinal coupling, the Hs are next to each other across a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the H on each CH is adjacent to the Hs on the next CH group, and perhaps the CH2 is too far away to cause splitting, or perhaps the coupling is only with the adjacent CH and the CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups are only coupled to the adjacent CH group's H, and perhaps the CH2 group is too far away to cause splitting.

Wait, in that case, each CH group's H would be split by the adjacent CH group's H (which is one H), leading to a doublet. But if each of those is also split by another group, perhaps the CH2's Hs, then the splitting becomes more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH is coupled to two different groups: one with two Hs (like a CH2) and another with one H (the adjacent CH). That would lead to a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, the splitting order would determine that. If the first split is by the CH (1 H), leading to a doublet, and then each of those is split by the CH2 (2 Hs), leading to a triplet, then the overall pattern would be a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the first split is by the CH2 (2 Hs), leading to a triplet, then each of those is split by the CH (1 H), leading to a doublet, so a triplet of doublets.

But in the problem, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a more complex splitting.

Hmm, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups are adjacent to more than two sets of Hs.

Wait, maybe each CH's H is coupled to two different groups: one with two Hs (like a CH2) and another with three Hs (like a CH3).

Wait, but the CH groups in the options are attached to substituents like CH3 or C2H5. Let me think about option D again.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Each CH is attached to a CH3 and a CH2 group on one side and a COOH on the other. Wait, no, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the two CH groups are connected: the first CH is attached to CH3CH2 and a CH3, and the second CH is attached to the first CH and a CH3, then the COOH.

Wait, the CH groups in D are each attached to a CH3 and the adjacent CH. The first CH is also attached to a CH2CH3 group, and the second to a COOH.

So, the H on each CH would be adjacent to the Hs on the CH2CH3 (if that's possible) and the Hs on the other CH.

Wait, perhaps the H on the first CH (attached to CH2CH3) is next to the H on the second CH, and the H on the second CH is next to the H on the first CH and perhaps the COOH's adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on each CH are coupled with each other and with the Hs on the CH2 group.

Wait, the CH2 group is at the end, so its Hs are on CH2CH3. The Hs on the CH2 (CH2CH3) would be adjacent to the H on the first CH.

So, the Hs on the first CH (attached to CH2CH3) would be adjacent to the Hs on the CH2 (two Hs) and the H on the adjacent CH (one H). So each H on the first CH would be split by both.

So, the splitting for the first CH's H would be caused by the two Hs on the CH2 and the one H on the adjacent CH.

So, first, the two Hs on the CH2 would split the first CH's H into a triplet (n+1, where n=2). Then, each of those triplet peaks would be split by the H on the adjacent CH, which has one H, leading to a doublet. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of doublets, which is 2×3=6 peaks. Alternatively, if the other way around, it could be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on the second CH (which is attached to the other CH and the COOH group) would be adjacent to the H on the first CH and perhaps any Hs on the COOH group, but I don't think so because COOH is a carboxylic acid, which is deprotonated in DMSO or if the solution is acidic, but in any case, the Hs adjacent would be the H on the first CH and perhaps any H on the CH2 group, but that might be too far.

Wait, but the second CH is only attached to the first CH and a CH3. So, its H is adjacent only to the H on the first CH. So, perhaps it's a doublet. But the problem states that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a different arrangement that leads to more coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH group is coupled with multiple Hs from different substituents.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the number of unique H environments in each structure.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

The Hs would be on the CH2 (CH2CH3), the two CH groups, and the COOH. But the COOH's H is broad and might be integrated but not observed as a separate peak because it's a broad singlet, perhaps.

The CH2CH3 group's Hs are a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH's H). The CH groups' Hs would each be adjacent to the CH2 and the other CH, so perhaps their splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH group's H is split by two different groups, leading to a doublet of triplets or similar.

Wait, let's think about the CH2 group. The CH2 is adjacent to the CH group. The CH2 has two Hs, so each would split into a doublet due to coupling with the single H on the adjacent CH.

So the CH2's Hs would be a doublet. The chemical shift would be around 1 ppm, perhaps.

Now, the H on the first CH (attached to CH2CH3 and CH3) is adjacent to the CH2's Hs (two Hs) and the H on the next CH (one H). So, the splitting for that H would be a triplet (from CH2) and each of those would split into a doublet (from the adjacent CH). So, the pattern would be a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets if the order is reversed.

Wait, in terms of order, the larger coupling constant (J) would determine the order of splitting. But I'm not sure about the exact order here.

So, the H on the first CH would be a doublet of triplets.

But the problem says one of the signals is a doublet of triplet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some coupling. Let's think again. The H on the first CH is adjacent to the CH2 (two Hs) and the adjacent CH (one H). So, perhaps the splitting is a triplet from the CH2, and then each of those is split into a doublet (from the adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets, depending on the order). But that's only two layers of splitting. The problem mentions a third layer, like quartets.

Hmm, perhaps each of those is further split by another group. For example, the adjacent CH's H is also adjacent to another group, so the splitting continues.

Wait, perhaps the H on the first CH is also adjacent to the H on the second CH, which in turn is adjacent to another group. Or maybe the H on the first CH is coupled with the Hs on the second CH and another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the CH groups have more Hs. For example, if they are attached to an ethyl group (like in option B and A), then the H on the CH would be adjacent to the ethyl group's Hs.

Wait, let's think about option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Each CH is attached to a C2H5 group and a H. The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So, the H on each CH is adjacent to the ethyl group (C2H5) and the adjacent CH.

Each CH's H is adjacent to the ethyl group's Hs and the H on the other CH.

Wait, but the ethyl group is a substituent on the CH. The H on the CH would be adjacent to the ethyl group's Hs, which are two Hs (if it's a CH2 in the ethyl group). Wait, no, the ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So, when attached to the CH, the ethyl group's adjacent Hs would be the two Hs on the CH2 of the ethyl group.

So, the H on the CH would be adjacent to the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 and the H on the adjacent CH.

Wait, but that's a bit of a stretch. Would the H on the CH couple with the Hs on the ethyl group's CH2? That depends on the proximity and whether the coupling constants are significant. In some cases, coupling across two bonds (like CH2-CH-) can be observed, but it's less common than coupling across one bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH is only coupled with the adjacent CH's H and any Hs on the same carbon as substituents, but that's not the case here.

So, perhaps the H on each CH would be split by the H on the adjacent CH (1 H) and the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 (if the coupling is significant).

In that case, the splitting would be a triplet (from the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH2) and then each of those would be split into a doublet (from the adjacent CH's H). So it would be a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets.

But the problem mentions a more complex splitting: a doublet of triplet of quartets and a doublet of triplet of triplets.

Hmm, perhaps the correct structure has Hs that are coupled with three different groups, leading to three layers of splitting.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the molecule has a geminal di-substitution, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a group with more Hs nearby.

Wait, let me think about option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So each CH is attached to a C2H5 group and a H. The CH groups are connected, and the CH2 is at the end.

The H on each CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH and the two Hs on the ethyl group's CH2.

So, perhaps the splitting would involve coupling with two Hs (from ethyl) and one H (from adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, which could be described as a doublet of triplets.

But how does that lead to triplets of quartets or triplets of triplets?

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH is also adjacent to the Hs on the CH2 group at the end (the CH2 connected to COOH). So, the CH2 has two Hs, which could couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH.

If that's the case, the H on the CH would be coupled with:

- The two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (maybe not, if coupling is too long),
- The one H on the adjacent CH,
- The two Hs on the other end's CH2.

Wait, but that would be three different coupling partners. So, the splitting would be a quartet (from CH2's 2 Hs), which is then split by the adjacent CH's H (doublet), and then each of those is split by the ethyl's CH2 (triplet). Or something like that.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think: If a proton is coupled with three different groups, each with n Hs, the splitting would be more complex. For example, if a proton is split by a group of 2 Hs, then another group of 3 Hs, and then another group of 2 Hs, the splitting could be a quartet (from 3 Hs) split into a triplet (from 2 Hs), leading to a quartet of triplets, and then each of those split again by another group.

But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the structures in the options are more symmetrical, leading to fewer unique H environments, which would explain the specific splitting patterns.

Wait, looking at the NMR data, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, perhaps each of these corresponds to different H environments in the molecule.

Looking for which option would have Hs that would split into such patterns.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

The structure is CH3-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-CH2-COOH.

Each CH is attached to a CH3 and a H, and the CH2 is at the end.

The H on each CH is adjacent to the other CH's H and the CH2's Hs.

So, the Hs on the CH groups are next to each other and the CH2.

The CH2's Hs are adjacent to the CH group's H.

So, the H on the CH would be split by the CH2's Hs (two Hs) and the adjacent CH's H (one H).

So, the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and then each triplet would be split into a doublet (from the adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets or vice versa.

But the problem's NMR includes signals that are split more than twice.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups are also adjacent to the CH3 groups, but I don't think that would cause splitting because the CH3 is attached to the same carbon.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider the number of unique H environments in each structure.

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the Hs would be on:

1. The CH2CH3 group: two Hs, which would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH's H).

2. The two CH groups: each with a H. Are these Hs equivalent? Since the two CH groups are attached to the same substituents (CH3 and the chain), they are equivalent, so their Hs would be a singlet, but adjacent to other Hs, so they would split.

Wait, no, the two CH groups are attached to CH3 on one side and to each other on the other. So, the two CH groups are in equivalent environments, so their Hs would be a singlet? But if they are adjacent, their Hs would split each other.

Wait, no, because each CH is on a different carbon, but the molecule is symmetric. For example, if the two CHs are in a symmetric position, their Hs would be equivalent, leading to a singlet. But if they're not, then their Hs would be a doublet.

Wait, but in option D, the two CH groups are attached to the same substituents (each has a CH3 and the other CH group). So, the molecule is symmetrical around the central axis. So the two CH groups are equivalent, so their Hs would be a singlet. But wait, each H is adjacent to the other, so perhaps they split into a doublet.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. In a symmetrical molecule like that, the two CH groups are equivalent. So, the Hs on each CH would be equivalent, but each would be adjacent to the other's H. So, each H is next to one other H (on the adjacent CH), so the splitting would be a doublet for each.

But because they're equivalent, the two Hs would be a doublet, but perhaps as a singlet because they're the same? No, that doesn't make sense. Because each H is coupled to one other H, so their splitting would be a doublet.

But in any case, the Hs on the CH groups would have a certain splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups are adjacent to the CH2CH3's Hs and the other CH's H. So, each H would be coupled with two Hs (from CH2CH3) and one H (from the other CH). So, the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2CH3) and each triplet would be split into a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a triplet of doublets.

But I'm still not matching the problem's data.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

In this structure, each CH is attached to an ethyl group (C2H5) and a H. The two CH groups are on either side of the molecule.

So, each CH's H is adjacent to the other CH's H and the ethyl group's Hs.

Each CH's H would be coupled with:

- The H on the adjacent CH (one H) → leading to a doublet.

- The two Hs on the CH2 of the ethyl group (if coupling is significant enough) → leading to a triplet.

So, the splitting would be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which implies three layers of splitting.

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH is also coupled with the Hs on the CH2 at the end (CH2COOH). So, that's another two Hs.

So, each CH's H is coupled with:

1. The adjacent CH's H → 1 H → doublet.

2. The ethyl group's CH2 → 2 H → triplet.

3. The end CH2 group → 2 H → triplet.

But that's three coupling partners, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but in reality, whether the coupling is significant for three bonds away (like to the end CH2) is questionable. Usually, coupling across three bonds is negligible unless in specific cases like allylic systems, which isn't the case here.

So perhaps only the adjacent CH and the ethyl group's CH2 are causing splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups are causing more complex splitting.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures and how their NMR would look.

The question states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl Hs, which we've already considered since there are no double bonds.

The IR data tells us about the presence of a carboxylic acid.

Now, the NMR:

- One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets.

- Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the 'quartets' come from coupling with three Hs elsewhere, but that's not present in the given structures.

Wait, what about the number of neighboring Hs for each signal.

For the first signal (doublet of triplet of quartets), the possible couplings could be:

- First split by 3 Hs → quartet.

- Each of those split by 2 Hs → triplet.

- Each of those split by 1 H → doublet.

So the order is quartet → triplet → doublet.

Alternatively, the splits could be in a different order.

But how would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe the H is coupled with three different groups: one with 3 Hs (like a CH3), another with 2 Hs (like a CH2), and another with 1 H (like a CH).

Wait, but in the given structures, perhaps each CH's H is coupled with a CH3 (3 Hs), a CH2 (2 Hs), and another CH (1 H).

But that's a stretch because the CH3 is on the same carbon as the H, so geminal coupling is usually negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with the CH2 group (2 Hs) and the adjacent CH group (1 H), leading to a triplet of doublets, but the problem's signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which suggests more splits.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with a CH2 (2 Hs), another CH2 (2 Hs), and a CH (1 H), leading to 2+1 splitting.

Wait, another possibility: The H is part of a longer chain where each coupling is with groups of different sizes.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me think about the number of signals. The NMR has several peaks, but the exact number isn't specified. However, each structure would have a certain number of unique H environments.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

The Hs would be:

1. The two Hs on the CH2CH3 group → triplet.

2. The two Hs on each CH group → but they are equivalent, so perhaps a singlet? No, because they are adjacent to other Hs. Alternatively, each would be a doublet.

Wait, but in a symmetrical molecule, the two CH groups are equivalent, so their Hs would be a doublet. So the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2CH3, a doublet for the two CH groups, and perhaps other signals.

But the problem mentions that one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option A.

Wait, option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

In this case, each CH is attached to an ethyl group and a H. The two CH groups are connected, and the CH2 is at the end.

The H on each CH is adjacent to:

- The H on the other CH (1 H).

- The two Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 (if coupling is significant).

- The two Hs on the CH2COOH group (if coupling is significant).

So, each CH's H would be split by these groups.

If we assume coupling with the ethyl's CH2 (2 Hs) and the adjacent CH (1 H), the splitting would be a triplet of doublets.

But the problem has a signal that's a doublet of triplet of quartets. Hmm.

Perhaps the CH2COOH group's Hs are also causing splitting. So each CH's H is coupled with:

- The adjacent CH (1 H) → doublet.

- The ethyl's CH2 (2 Hs) → triplet.

- The CH2COOH's Hs (2 Hs) → triplet.

So, the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2COOH) → each of those split into a triplet (from ethyl's CH2) → each of those split into a doublet (from adjacent CH).

So, the pattern would be a triplet of triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplet of triplets.

Ah, that might fit. Because 2 Hs (CH2COOH) → triplet (n=2), then 2 Hs (ethyl's CH2) → triplet again, and then 1 H (adjacent CH) → doublet.

Wait, but the order of splitting depends on the coupling constants. If the CH2COOH's J is larger than the ethyl's J, the splitting order would be triplet (from CH2COOH) → triplet (from ethyl) → doublet (from CH).

So, the signal would be a triplet of triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplet of triplets. Wait, no. Because the order would matter.

Wait, the splitting process is a cascade. Let me think: first, the H is split by the CH2COOH (2 Hs) → triplet. Then each peak in that triplet is split by the ethyl's CH2 (2 Hs) → each becomes a triplet. So now, each peak is split into triplet → triplet. So that's a triplet of triplet. Then, each of those is split by the adjacent CH's H (1 H) → each becomes a doublet. So overall, the pattern is triplet → triplet → doublet, which would be a doublet of triplet of triplets.

Wait, no, the order is from largest J to smallest. If the coupling with CH2COOH has a larger J (closer proximity), that splitting happens first. Then the ethyl's CH2, then the adjacent CH.

So, the splitting order would be:

1. Split by CH2COOH (2 H) → triplet.

2. Each peak is split by ethyl's CH2 (2 H) → triplet again.

3. Each peak is split by adjacent CH (1 H) → doublet.

So, the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplet of doublets, but the way it's described in the problem is a doublet of triplet of triplets. Hmm, not matching exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the first split is by the ethyl's CH2 (2 Hs) → triplet, then by the adjacent CH (1 H) → doublet, and then by CH2COOH (2 Hs) → triplet.

So the pattern would be triplet (ethyl) → doublet (CH) → triplet (CH2COOH), which is a triplet of doublet of triplet.

But the problem says a doublet of triplet of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is split by three groups: ethyl's CH2 (2 Hs), the adjacent CH (1 H), and the CH2COOH (2 Hs). So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2COOH), each split into a triplet (from ethyl), each split into a doublet (from adjacent CH). So that's triplet → triplet → doublet.

But the problem's first signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets. Quartet implies 3 Hs, but none of the substituents have 3 Hs except maybe CH3 groups, but they're not adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the H is coupled with a group of 3 Hs. But where would that come from? None of the substituents in the options seem to have 3 Hs except the CH3 groups.

Wait, in option A: each CH is attached to an ethyl group (C2H5) and a H. So the ethyl group's CH2 has 2 Hs, and the CH3 in the ethyl has 3 Hs. But the H on the CH would be adjacent to the CH2, not the CH3. So, the coupling with the ethyl's CH3 would be through space, which is usually not significant.

So, perhaps the CH3 groups are not causing splitting in the H's NMR signal.

Hmm, another approach: The number of neighboring Hs for each proton.

Looking for a structure where one H is adjacent to 3 other Hs from different groups, leading to a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH is adjacent to a CH3 group (3 Hs), a CH2 group (2 Hs), and another CH (1 H). Then the splitting would be a quartet (3 Hs) → triplet (2 Hs) → doublet (1 H), leading to a quartet of triplet of doublets.

But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH group's H is adjacent to a CH2 group (2 Hs), another CH2 group (2 Hs), and a CH (1 H). Then, the splitting would be a triplet (2 Hs) → triplet (another 2 Hs) → doublet (1 H), leading to a triplet of triplet of doublets.

But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because in option A, each CH is attached to an ethyl group, which has a CH2 and a CH3. So, the H on the CH would be adjacent to the ethyl's CH2 (2 Hs) and the adjacent CH (1 H). So, the splitting would be a triplet of doublets.

But the problem has a more complex pattern, like a doublet of triplet of quartets.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option D, where each CH's H is adjacent to the CH2CH3 (2 Hs) and the adjacent CH (1 H). So, the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2CH3) → each split into a doublet (from adjacent CH). So, that's a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets if the order is reversed.

But the problem has signals that are doublet of triplet of quartets and another as doublet of triplet of triplets. So, perhaps there's another split.

Wait, perhaps the CH2CH3's H is split by the CH's H, leading to a quartet. But that's the other way around—the CH's H would split the CH2's Hs.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that the CH2 group's Hs are split by the adjacent CH's H, leading to a triplet, and the CH's H is split by the CH2's Hs, leading to a triplet. So each CH2's H is a triplet, and each CH's H is a triplet.

But that doesn't explain the more complex patterns.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the number of signals.

The problem says that there are several peaks in the 1H NMR, none of which are vinyl. So, the molecule doesn't have any double bonds.

Looking at the options, all have a straight chain except for branching.

Now, considering the NMR splitting, what structure would lead to a signal that's a doublet of triplet of quartets?

Perhaps the structure has a branching where each CH is attached to a CH2 group and another CH group, leading to multiple couplings.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

In this case, each CH is attached to an ethyl group and a H. The ethyl group's CH2 has two Hs, and the CH2 at the end has two Hs.

So, the H on each CH is adjacent to:

- The H on the other CH (1 H).

- The two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (2 Hs).

- The two Hs on the end CH2 (2 Hs).

So, the splitting would be:

1. Coupled with the end CH2 (2 Hs) → triplet.

2. Coupled with the ethyl's CH2 (2 Hs) → triplet.

3. Coupled with the adjacent CH (1 H) → doublet.

So, the splitting would be a triplet (end CH2) → triplet (ethyl's CH2) → doublet (adjacent CH).

But the order of splitting would depend on the coupling constants. If the end CH2 has a larger J, it would split first, leading to a triplet of triplet of doublet.

But the problem mentions a doublet of triplet of quartets. Hmm, quartet implies coupling with 3 Hs, which we don't have.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to count the number of neighboring Hs for each option.

Option D: Each CH's H is adjacent to the CH2's Hs (2 Hs) and the other CH's H (1 H).

So, the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) → doublet (from CH), leading to a triplet of doublets (or vice versa).

But the problem has a more complex pattern.

Option A: Each CH's H is adjacent to ethyl's CH2 (2 Hs), adjacent CH (1 H), and end CH2 (2 Hs).

So, the splitting would be a triplet (end CH2) → triplet (ethyl's CH2) → doublet (adjacent CH). So, a triplet of triplet of doublets.

But the problem's data mentions a doublet of triplet of quartets and a doublet of triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and the signals mentioned correspond to the CH groups and the CH2 groups.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another approach: The presence of a triplet of quartets implies that one of the groups has a split from 3 Hs (quartet). So where would 3 Hs come from in the structure?

Looking at the options, the only groups with 3 Hs are the CH3 groups attached to the CHs.

In option D, each CH is attached to a CH3. So, the H on the CH is adjacent to the CH3's Hs (3 Hs), but coupling across a single bond (C-H and C-CH3) is possible, but it's usually not observed because the coupling constant J is very small. In most cases, such coupling is not significant and doesn't show up in the NMR spectrum.

So, perhaps the H on the CH isn't split by the CH3's Hs.

Given that, perhaps the quartet in the NMR is not from a CH3, but from another group.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group at the end (like in option A) has 2 Hs, but that's a triplet, not a quartet.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are causing the quartets through some other means, but I can't think of how.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options and the data.

The IR data: carboxylic acid.

The NMR data: no vinyl Hs, complex splitting.

Looking at the options, option A has ethyl groups which have CH2 and CH3. The CH groups in A are attached to ethyl groups, so their Hs would be coupled with the ethyl's CH2 and the adjacent CH. So, each CH's H would have coupling with 2 Hs (ethyl's CH2) and 1 H (adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets.

But the problem's NMR has a signal that's a doublet of triplet of quartets. So, perhaps this doesn't fit.

Option D: The CH groups are attached to methyl groups (CH3), so their Hs would be coupled with the adjacent CH2 (2 Hs) and the methyl's CH3 (3 Hs, but likely negligible coupling).

So, the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) → but perhaps there's another coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group's Hs are split by the adjacent CH's H, leading to a quartet (if the CH's H is coupled with the CH2's Hs), but that's not the case.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The problem mentions that one of the NMR signals is a doublet of triplet of quartets. Quartet usually comes from three neighboring Hs.

In which option would a proton be adjacent to three Hs?

Looking at option A: Each CH is attached to an ethyl group, which has a CH2 (2 Hs) and a CH3 (3 Hs). So, perhaps the H on the CH is adjacent to the CH3's Hs. But J for coupling to a CH3 is usually small and not observed.

But if it's observed, the H would be split by 3 Hs → quartet.

So, the splitting would be:

- Quartet (from CH3) → triplet (from CH2) → doublet (from adjacent CH).

But the order would be from largest J to smallest.

If the CH3's coupling (quartet) is first, followed by ethyl's CH2 (triplet), then adjacent CH (doublet), the pattern would be a quartet of triplet of doublets.

But in the problem, the signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets. So, the order is reversed.

Alternatively, the order is from smallest J to largest.

If the splitting first occurs due to the adjacent CH (doublet), then the ethyl's CH2 (triplet), then the CH3 (quartet), the pattern would be a doublet of triplet of quartets.

That matches one of the signals in the problem.

So, in option A, the H on the CH would be split by:

1. The adjacent CH (1 H) → doublet.

2. The ethyl's CH2 (2 Hs) → triplet.

3. The ethyl's CH3 (3 Hs) → quartet.

But is the CH3's coupling significant? Usually, coupling to a CH3 is not observed because the Hs are too far apart. But in some cases, like allylic positions, coupling can be observed.

But in this case, the CH is attached to a CH2CH3 group, which is adjacent. So, the H on the CH is attached to a CH which is attached to CH2CH3. So, the H on the CH is adjacent to the CH2, but the CH3 is two bonds away (CH2-CH3). So, perhaps coupling to the CH3's Hs is negligible.

Therefore, the quartet might not be from the CH3, but from another group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm barking up the wrong tree.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option A, and the splitting comes from the ethyl groups' CH2 and the adjacent CH.

So, each CH's H would be split into a triplet (from ethyl's CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets.

But the problem mentions a more complex pattern.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's the only one where the CH groups are attached to ethyl groups, which have more Hs nearby, leading to more complex splitting.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: Look for the number of signals in each option's NMR.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

The possible H environments are:

- CH3CH2's Hs → triplet.

- Each CH's H → adjacent to CH2 and CH → doublet.

- The end COOH's H → broad singlet (but not observed as a peak because it's integrated).

So, the NMR would show a triplet and a doublet.

But the problem mentions several peaks, so perhaps more than two.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The H environments:

- CH3's H → singlet (but adjacent to CH, so might split).

- Each CH's H → adjacent to ethyl's CH2, adjacent CH, and CH2COOH → complex splitting.

- CH2COOH's Hs → quartet (coupled with CH).

- Each ethyl's CH2 → triplet (coupled with CH).

Wait, maybe the ethyl's CH2 would be a triplet, the CH groups would have complex splitting, and the CH2COOH would be a quartet.

But I'm not sure.

Given all this, I'm going to make an educated guess that the correct answer is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.


The question involves identifying a compound based on FTIR and ¹H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, specifically a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR spectrum reveals several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, and two complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**
- The structure consists of two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group (C₂H₅), and a CH₂ group at the end.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to:
  1. The H on the adjacent CH (1 H), leading to a doublet.
  2. The two Hs on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2 H), leading to a triplet.
  3. The two Hs on the CH₂COOH group (2 H), leading to a triplet.
- The splitting pattern for the CH groups would be a triplet (from CH₂COOH) → triplet (from ethyl CH₂) → doublet (from adjacent CH), resulting in a doublet of triplets of triplets.
- The CH₂ group at the end would appear as a quartet (coupled with the CH group's H).

#### **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**
- The structure is similar to Option A but lacks the CH₂ group at the end. The CH groups are directly attached to the COOH group.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to:
  1. The H on the adjacent CH (1 H), leading to a doublet.
  2. The two Hs on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2 H), leading to a triplet.
- The splitting pattern for the CH groups would be a triplet (from ethyl CH₂) → doublet (from adjacent CH), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- However, this structure does not account for the quartet splitting observed in the NMR data.

#### **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**
- The structure consists of two CH groups, each attached to a methyl group (CH₃), and a CH₂ group at the end.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to:
  1. The H on the adjacent CH (1 H), leading to a doublet.
  2. The two Hs on the CH₂ group (2 H), leading to a triplet.
- The splitting pattern for the CH groups would be a triplet (from CH₂) → doublet (from adjacent CH), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- This structure does not account for the quartet splitting observed in the NMR data.

#### **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**
- The structure consists of two CH groups, each attached to a methyl group (CH₃), and a CH₂ group at the beginning.
- The H on each CH is adjacent to:
  1. The H on the adjacent CH (1 H), leading to a doublet.
  2. The two Hs on the CH₂ group (2 H), leading to a triplet.
- The splitting pattern for the CH groups would be a triplet (from CH₂) → doublet (from adjacent CH), resulting in a doublet of triplets.
- This structure does not account for the quartet splitting observed in the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the only structure that accounts for the observed splitting patterns in the NMR data. The CH groups in Option A are adjacent to both the ethyl group's CH₂ (2 H) and the CH₂COOH group (2 H), leading to the complex splitting patterns described in the problem. The other options fail to explain the quartet splitting observed in the NMR data.

**Answer: A**
