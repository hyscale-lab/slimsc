Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. Hmm, what's the structure of the reactant?

The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me visualize that. The benzene ring has an ether group, O-, attached to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 2,2-dimethyl, so the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, wait, no. Wait, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. The numbering is such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Or wait, wait, the structure is but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait. Butenyl could be but-1-ene or but-2-ene. But in this case, it's but-3-en-1-yl. Wait, butenyl is four carbons. So if it's but-3-en-1-yl, that would mean the double bond is between C3 and C4, but that's not possible because butenyl is four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it out.

The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is an alkenyl group attached via the first carbon. So the structure is: the first carbon is attached to the oxygen (O-) of the ether. Then, the second carbon has two methyl groups (so it's 2,2-dimethyl). The next carbon is the third, and then the fourth. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, but wait, the double bond is at position 3. So, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, but butenyl has four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at position 3? Wait, that can't be, because four carbons can't have a double bond starting at C3. Wait, but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH2
