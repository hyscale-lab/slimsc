Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is that there are three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, right? I remember that TTV is a method used to detect exoplanets by observing the variations in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. So, this method can detect other planets in the system because the gravitational pull of those other planets affects the timing of the transits.

The problem gives me some ratios. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. And the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. From that, I can find T1/T3. Let me calculate that. T1 is 1.4 times T2, and T2 is 2.3 times T3. So T1 is 1.4 * (2.3*T3) = 3.22 * T3. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3. But wait, I'm not sure if I need the temperature ratios yet, but let me hold onto that thought.

Next, the problem states the mass ratios. The mass of Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, so M1/M2 = 1.15. And M2/M3 is about 1.35. So M1 is 1.15 times M2, and M2 is 1.35 times M3. So M1 would be 1.15 * 1.35 * M3. Let me calculate 1.15 * 1.35. 1.15 * 1.3 is 1.495, and 1.15 * 0.05 is 0.0575, so adding them gives around 1.5525. So M1 is approximately 1.5525 times M3. So M1/M3 ≈ 1.5525.

The question is asking about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Specifically, by what factor is Planet3's period larger than Planet1's. So we're looking for P3/P1.

All three planets have the same albedo, 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo affects how much sunlight a planet absorbs. The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4), where L is luminosity, a is albedo, and d is the distance from the star.

But wait, all three planets orbit the same star, right? Because they're part of the same system. So L and sigma (σ) are constants for each system. So the equilibrium temperature would be proportional to ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) / d^(1/2). Since albedos are the same for all, a is 0.3 for each. So (1 - a) is 0.7, same for all. So T is proportional to 1/d^(1/2), or d^(-1/2). So the ratio of T for two planets would be (d2 / d1 )^(-1/2).

So T1/T2 = sqrt( d2/d1 ). Wait, because if T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), then T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). Wait, let me think again. Let me write the equilibrium temperature formula.

Equilibrium temperature T is given by:

T = [ (L (1 - a)
