Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a pretty complicated organic molecule. The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break this down.

Wait, the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I need to figure out how much energy is released or absorbed when this molecule is formed from its constituent elements: carbon and hydrogen.

But wait, the problem gives me some bond energies instead. Oh right, bond energies can be used to calculate the enthalpy change for a reaction. I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies, considering the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products.

The formula I think I should use is: Enthalpy of formation = sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in reactants - sum of bond energies of all bonds formed in products. Or wait, maybe I have it backwards? No, wait. The enthalpy change is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Because when bonds break, energy is absorbed, and when bonds form, energy is released.

But wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think. For the formation of a molecule from elements, the reactants are the elements in
