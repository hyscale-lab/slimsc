Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and the periods are given as 2 years and 1 year respectively. So the period between primary eclipses is 2 years for system 1 and 1 year for system 2.

Then, the spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. We need to consider the total mass of each system.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocities are related to the masses of the stars. I think it's something about the more massive star moving slower because it's less massive objects that orbit a more massive one. Oh right, the more massive star has a smaller orbit, so it's moving slower. So the RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars.

Wait, let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula: K = (v) = (2Ï€ G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + q)), where q is M2/M1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting into too much detail.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler approach. Oh right, the ratio of the two velocities (K1 and K2) is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses (M1 and M2). Because in a binary system, M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. Each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass. So if star A is more massive than star B, then A's velocity is smaller than B's. So in the system, M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. Because the center of mass is stationary, so the product of mass and velocity for each star is the same but opposite in direction.

So
