Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. The question gives me two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods—2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Wait, the problem says the period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think relates to the orbital period of the stars around each other.

Then, they talk about radial velocity (RV) variations. RV is the speed at which the stars move toward or away from us. System_1 has amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Oh right, the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

I think I need to relate the radial velocities to the masses. I recall that in binary systems, the more massive star is closer to the center of mass. So the more massive star will have a smaller orbit and thus a smaller velocity amplitude because velocity is inversely proportional to mass (since they share the same orbital period and separation).

The formula comes into play. Let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ). Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, another approach might be using the fact that the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. Because for a binary system, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the semi-major axis. Since a is the radius of the orbit, and velocity is 2πa / P. So, v is proportional to a / P. But since M1 a1 = M2 a2, and a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a_total, a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a_total.

Wait, another approach: The two stars orbit each other with a certain period. The more massive star has a smaller orbit. The radial velocity is proportional to the size of their orbit and inversely proportional to the period. So for each star, their velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) are inversely proportional to their masses. Because from Kepler's third law, M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. Because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, and velocity is 2π a / P, so v1 = (2π a1)/P, v2 = (2π a2)/P. So M1 * (a1) = M2 a2 → M1 (v1 P/(2π)) ) = M2 (v2 P/(2π)) ). So M1 v1 = M2 v2. So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

Wait, that seems right. So for each system, M1 and M2 are the two masses. So in system_1, K1 = 10 km/s and K2 =5 km/s. So M1/M2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 1/2. So the mass ratio is 1/2, so M1 = (1/3) * total mass, M2 = (2/3) * total mass. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = (1/3 + 2/3) = 1. So M1 is (1/3) of total, M2 is (2/3). So the mass ratio is M1/(M1+M2) = 1/3. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it another way.

In each binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit. So the velocity of each star (as measured by their radial velocity semi-amplitude) is inversely proportional to their mass. Because v = (2π a)/P, where a is the radius of their orbit. And since M1 a1 = M2 a2, v1 = (2π a1)/P = (2π (M2/(M1+M2)) a_total ) / P. Similarly, v2 = (2π a2)/P = (2π (M1/(M1+M2)) a_total ) / P.

So, K1 (the velocity of star 1) is proportional to M2, and K2 is proportional to M1. Because K1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ), but I'm not sure if that's needed here.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2 is equal to the inverse ratio of the masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because from the mass and velocity relation, M1 K1 = M2 K2. So K1/K2 = M2/M1. So for system_1, K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So 10/5 = M2/M1 → 2 = M2/M1 → M2 = 2 M1. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1 → M1 = (M_total_1)/3, M2 = 2 M_total_1/3.

Similarly, for system_2, K1 is 15 and K2 is 10. So K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2 = M2/M1. So M2 = (3/2) M1. So the total mass M_total_2 = M1 + (3/2 M1) = (5/2 M1) → M1 = (2/5) M_total_2, M2 = (3/5) M_total_2.

Now, the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So we need to find (M_total_1 / M_total_2).

But wait, do we have another relation between the systems? The periods are given. For system_1, period P1 is 2 years, system_2 P2 is 1 year.

Wait, but I think the periods might not be needed for comparing the masses, because the total mass can be found through the radial velocities and the period, perhaps.

Wait, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula: (M1 + M2) = (4π² a³)/(G P²), where a is the separation between the stars and P is the orbital period. But since in binary systems, a is the sum of a1 and a2, which are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the center of mass.

Alternatively, the formula using radial velocities: the mass function comes into play. The mass function is f(M) = (K1^3 P) / (241 * 2π G), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the total mass can be found if we know the velocities and the period.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the mass ratio and the periods.

Wait, perhaps the mass of each system can be found from the radial velocities. Let me think. The mass function is f(M) = ( (K1^3 P) ) / (2π G), which gives a lower limit on the mass. But without knowing the inclination (sin i), we can't get the exact mass. But since both systems are eclipsing, i is approximately 90 degrees, so sin i is 1. So maybe that allows us to find the actual masses.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let's try to write the mass function for each system.

The mass function for a binary system is given by:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P) ) / (2942) 

where K1 is in km/s, P is in years, and f(M) is in solar masses.

Wait, the formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K² P) ) / (2.14e5) ) * ( (1 + q)^2 ) / q^3 )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that (M1 sin i) / (M2) = K2 / K1. Since M1 K1 = M2 K2 → M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, earlier I thought K1/K2 = M2/M1, which is correct. So for system_1:

M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2 → M2 = 2 M1. So the mass ratio is 2:1.

For system_2
