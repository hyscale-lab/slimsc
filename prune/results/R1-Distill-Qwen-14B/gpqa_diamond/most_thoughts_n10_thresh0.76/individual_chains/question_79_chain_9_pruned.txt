Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR data of its reaction product. Let's see what I can remember.

So the compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I think that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, maybe used for elimination reactions. Oh wait, it's also used as a catalyst in certain reactions, maybe like the opening of epoxides or some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, I'm a bit hazy on that. Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used in elimination reactions, especially in the formation of alkenes from epoxides. Oh, like the acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide would form a diol, but with a strong base, maybe it's the opposite—like an elimination. So perhaps the compound X is an epoxide, and when treated with this base, it undergoes a ring-opening to form a styryl group or something with a double bond.

Wait, so the product would then have a double bond. Looking at the NMR data of the product. Let's look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Each signal's integration is given. So we have two singlets each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups, possibly attached to something that doesn't have neighboring protons. Like, maybe two methyl groups attached to a carbonyl or something, or perhaps in a structure where their protons are not split. Alternatively, maybe they are attached to an aromatic ring in a way that their neighboring Hs are not causing splitting. But wait, aromatic methyl groups are usually around 2.3-2.4 ppm as singlets, like in toluene or similar.

Then, the other signals are in the aromatic region. Let's see:

6.75 (1H, d) – that's a downfield shift, perhaps a para-substituted aromatic proton. Wait, or maybe an ortho or meta. But the coupling is doublet, so maybe a coupling with one adjacent proton.

7.08 (2H, d) – two protons as a doublet. Hmm, maybe adjacent to two protons each, but in a pattern that's a doublet. Wait, maybe this is part of a substituted benzene ring where the protons are in a para arrangement but with substituents.

7.68 (1H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm, these are even more downfield, so maybe more electronegative substituents nearby, like a carbonyl group or something. Wait, but the 13C NMR shows a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl carbon, probably a ketone or an aldehyde. But wait, that's a high ppm. Wait, wait, 197.7 is a bit high for a ketone; more like an aldehyde. Or maybe an ester or something else. Wait, no, esters are around 170 ppm. So maybe a ketone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe an epoxide's carbonyl. Wait, no, epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Oh, wait, an ester or an aldehyde? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in a styryl group?

Wait,
