Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, let me try to think this through. The question is about the allowed decay channels of the boson X at the lowest order, given its mass is 6 GeV. 

First, I need to remember some basics about particle physics. Bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? So the Lagrangian given is for the interaction between X and fermions. The term is something like λ times a Yukawa coupling, I think. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). 

Wait, so the interaction term is X ψ_f ψ_f. That suggests that X can couple to a pair of fermions ψ_f. So the decay X → f f-bar would be possible—assuming the fermion mass allows it. 

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to consider which fermions have a mass less than 6 GeV, because for a decay to be possible, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the parent particle. 

Let me list the known fermions and their masses. 

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Their masses are approximately:

- Up: about 2 MeV (so negligible)
- Down: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange: ~100 MeV
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
- Top: ~173 GeV (way too heavy, since 173 >6)

Leptons: electron, muon, tau. Their masses:

- Electron: ~0.5 MeV
- Muon: ~105 MeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible.

Wait, but for fermions in the decay, I should consider whether their rest masses are less than 6 GeV. So for each possible fermion pair, I should check if twice their mass is less than 6 GeV. Because when a boson decays into a fermion pair, each fermion must have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So 2m_f ≤ M_X.

So let's go through each fermion:

1. Up quark: m_u ~ 2 MeV. 2m_u = 4 MeV << 6 GeV. So X can decay into u u-bar.

2. Down quark: m_d ~ 5 MeV. 2m_d=10 MeV <<6 GeV. So d and d-bar are allowed.

3. Strange quark: m_s ~ 100 MeV. 2m_s=200 MeV < 6 GeV. So s and s-bar are allowed.

4. Charm quark: m_c ~1.5 GeV. 2m_c=3 GeV <6 GeV. So c and c-bar allowed.

5. Bottom quark: m_b ~4.5 GeV. 2m_b=9 GeV >6 GeV. So decay into b and b-bar is not allowed. Because 9 GeV is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused here. The X has 6 GeV, and the b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So each b would need 4.5 GeV, so two would require 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So decay into b b-bar is forbidden. So the option with b b-bar is out.

6. Top quark: way too heavy, 173 GeV. So no decay into t t-bar.

Now for leptons:

Electron: 2m_e ~1 MeV. So allowed.

Muon: 2m_mu ~210 MeV. Allowed.

Tau: 2m_tau ~3.55 GeV. So 3.55 GeV <6 GeV. So tau and anti-tau are allowed.

What about neutrinos? Well, their mass is negligible, but in reality, their masses are very small. But in the problem, the interaction term is given and it's written as (v + X(y)), but maybe the coupling is for charged fermions. Because the problem statement doesn't mention neutrinos, and the Lagrangian has ψ_f which I think refers to charged fermions (since neutrinos are usually left-handed and might have different couplings, but I'm not sure). But the problem's options don't include neutrinos, so maybe we can ignore them.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: includes b and s, but not c. Because option A lists X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, e. But earlier I determined that b is too heavy, so A can't be correct.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed fermions except for top and bottom. Let's see:

Because for fermions, the decay is allowed if the mass is less than 3 GeV (since M_X is 6 GeV, so each can have up to 3 GeV). So charm (1.5 GeV) is allowed, same with strange (0.1 GeV), up (negligible), down (negligible), tau (1.77 GeV), mu (0.1 GeV), e (0.0005 GeV).

But wait, when you have X→ c c-bar, the sum is 3 GeV, which is less than 6, so that's allowed.

So option B includes c, which is allowed, as well as s, u, d, tau, mu, and e. So B would have X decay into all these.

But wait, what about the tau? Because 2m_tau is about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau and anti-tau would be allowed. So option B is X→c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is: c, s, u, d, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's correct. So B would have all these except b.

But the problem says, "bosonic field X and fermions". The interaction term is given, and perhaps contains all the fermions. Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the fermions are accessible via decay.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

But earlier, I thought that the bottom quark is too heavy, so b b-bar is not allowed. So D is incorrect because it includes b, which can't be decayed into.

Option A has b, which is wrong. So A is incorrect.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is top quark, which is way too heavy, so C is incorrect.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So what's the maximum mass for a fermion pair?

Each fermion can be up to 3 GeV, but in reality, we have to think about the available fermions.

Wait, another thing: the interaction term is -λ f ψ_f (y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f. So the interaction is proportional to X ψ_f ψ_f. So which fermions can X decay into? Any fermion pair where the individual fermion masses allow.

So for each fermion f, the mass of X must be at least 2 m_f. So let's look at each fermion's mass:

- e: ~0.5 MeV → 2m_e ~1 MeV → allowed.

- mu: ~105 MeV → 2m_mu ~210 MeV → allowed.

- tau: ~1.777 GeV → 2m_tau ~3.554 GeV → 3.554 <6 GeV → allowed.

- u: ~2 MeV → allowed.

- d: ~5 MeV → allowed.

- s: ~100 MeV → allowed.

- c: ~1.5 GeV → allowed.

- b: ~4.5 GeV → 2m_b=9 GeV >6 → not allowed.

- t: much heavier, so no.

So the allowed fermion pairs are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the decay channels would include all of these, except for the bottom and top quarks.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes all of these. So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order, we analyze the interaction term in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

This term indicates that \( X \) can couple to fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)), and the decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is possible if the total energy required for the fermion pair is less than the mass of \( X \). The mass of \( X \) is given as 6 GeV, so the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \).
