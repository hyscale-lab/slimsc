Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It looks a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question has two reactions, and I need to find the major products A and B based on the given conditions. Then choose the correct option from A to D.

First, let's look at reaction 1:

1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + THF, KH, H+ → A

Hmm, okay. So the starting material is a spiro compound. I remember that spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the oxygen because the formula is 1-ol, so the alcohol is on the spiro atom.

The reagents are THF (which is a solvent, usually for Grignard reactions), KH (which is potassium hydride, a strong base), and then H+. Wait, but wait—KH is a strong base, often used to deprotonate things. But looking at the conditions, it's THF, then treatment with KH, and then H+. Or is it that the reaction is done by using KH in THF, followed by acid workup?

Wait, or maybe it's a conjugate addition or some kind of elimination? Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by some kind of cyclization.

The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The structure would have two rings: a three-membered and a five-membered ring? Or wait, wait. Spiro numbers indicate the bridge. So spiro[3.5]non- would imply that the main chain is a nine-carbon chain? Or no, wait. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The numbers in the brackets refer to the number of carbons in each bridge. So spiro[3.5]non-... So the main part would be non, which is nine carbons. So, the molecule would have two rings: one with three carbons (including the spiro atom) and another with five carbons (again, including the spiro atom). So the structure would have two rings connected at one carbon.

But perhaps I should draw this out mentally. The spiro is at position 1, and there's a vinyl group attached there. The structure would be something like:

O

C-(CH2)3-C=CH2 (but wait, that's a rough idea; perhaps more accurately, the spiro is between two rings, each with a certain number of carbons, and there's a double bond at position 5 and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the spiro carbon.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions. KH is a strong base, but in THF. Then adding H+.

Wait, I've heard that when you have a dienol or a conjugated diene with an alcohol, treatment with a strong base like LDA or something can lead to elimination, forming a conjugated diene. But in this case, the starting material is a spiro compound with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. Wait, but spiro compounds
