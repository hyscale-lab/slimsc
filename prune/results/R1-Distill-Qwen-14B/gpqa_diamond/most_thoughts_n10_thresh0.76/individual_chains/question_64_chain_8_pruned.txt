Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these types of questions. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. Only a mixture of gases was formed, and this gas was passed through three tubes. The first tube has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second is a Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gained 3.60 g, tube 3 gained 0.80 g, and tube 2's weight didn't change. After this, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure. The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. The setup involves heating salts and then testing the resulting gases through certain reagents. I remember that when salts are heated, they can decompose into gases and other products. The reagents in the tubes probably react with specific gases, allowing us to identify what the gases are.

So, the first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, anhydrous. I think Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant, so maybe it reacts with water. Oh wait, no, if it's anhydrous, maybe it reacts with water vapor. Because Mg(ClO4)2 is used as a drying agent. When it absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So the increase in mass in tube 1 (3.60g) probably corresponds to the mass of water absorbed. Because Mg(ClO4)2 is highly deliquescent, it will absorb water from the air.

The second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. Ca(OH)2 is a base. If the gas mixture has CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But the problem states that the weight of tube 2 didn't change. So maybe no CO2 was present, which suggests that the original gases didn't contain CO2. Alternatively, maybe all the CO2 was absorbed, but since the weight didn't change, perhaps there was no CO2 at all.

The third tube has red-hot copper. Cu is a reducing agent. If the gas is a halogen, like HCl or maybe HBr, it might react with copper. Wait, no, red-hot copper in the presence of such gases would typically react. For example, HCl gas reacts with hot Cu to form CuCl and water, but I'm not sure about the details. Alternatively, if the gas is something like H2S, but I don't think so. Or maybe SO2? Hmm. The tube's mass increased by 0.80g. And as a result, CuO is formed. Wait, but if HCl is present, does it react with Cu? Let me think. I recall that HCl is not a strong enough oxidizer at lower temperatures. But when HCl is passed over hot copper, it might not react. Wait, or maybe it's another gas.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is water vapor. But that doesn't make sense because if it's passed through Mg(ClO4)2, which absorbs water, then tube 3 would have reacted differently. Alternatively, maybe the gas is another type. Let's think about the reactions.

Wait, another angle: the gases passed through these tubes. The first tube (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60g. Since Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, it probably absorbed water, so the mass increase is due to H2O. So, assuming the gas mixture contained water vapor, but wait, but in that case, when the gas is passed through Mg(ClO4)2, the water would be absorbed. But in the second tube, if any CO2 was present, the solution would gain mass. But in this case, the solution's weight didn't change, so perhaps the original gas didn't have CO2. Then, the third tube had copper, and the mass increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. So maybe the gas is something that reacts with Cu to form CuO.

Wait, SO3 gas would react with Cu, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2O? But why would H2O react with copper? Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's HCl? I thought HCl doesn't react with copper at room temperature, but when heated, perhaps it does. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something like ammonia, but that's unlikely because Mg(ClO4)2 is used for drying NH3 as well.

Wait, another thought: the reaction in the third tube, the mass increase is 0.80g, and CuO is formed.
