Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The formula is distance d = 1/plx, where plx is the parallax in parsecs. So, as parallax increases, the distance decreases. Oh right, because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, the number of stars in a certain range of parallax. Wait, but stars are uniformly distributed. That would mean that the number density is the same in all regions, right?

Wait, but the distribution in terms of distance... Because higher parallax means closer, but the volume around a point increases with distance. Wait, no, the volume per unit distance increases because it's a sphere. So when you're considering stars at a certain distance, the number of stars you can find in a thin shell depends on the surface area and the thickness of the shell.

Let me think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density n is constant. The number of stars in a volume V is n * V. So, I need to figure out how V depends on parallax.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's say I have a small change in parallax, Δplx. That corresponds to a change in distance Δd. But wait, since d = 1/plx, then Δd = (d^2) Δplx. Because differentiating d = (1/plx) gives dd = (1/plx^2) d plx, so Δd ≈ (1/(plx)^2) Δplx. Hmm, I think that's correct.

Wait, no, wait. Let's see: plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, if I increase plx by a small amount Δplx, how does d change? Let me compute it:

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So, a small change in plx leads to a change in d of approximately - (1/plx²) Δplx. The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the purposes of volume, I think I can just take the magnitude.

So, the volume between d and d + Δd is a spherical shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr. So, in this case, the volume element dV is 4π (d)^2 Δd.

Substituting Δd from before, which is (1/(plx²)) Δplx. So, dV = 4π (d)^2 * (Δplx / plx²).

But d is 1/plx, so d^2 is 1/(plx²). Plugging that in:

dV = 4π (1/(plx²)) * (Δplx / plx²) ) → 4π (Δplx) / plx^4.

Wait, let me recheck that. d squared is (1/plx)^2, which is 1/(plx^2). Multiply that by 4π, and then by Δd, which is (1/(plx²)) Δplx. So, 4π * (1/plx²) * (Δplx / plx²) ) = 4π Δplx / plx^4.

So, the volume of that shell is proportional to 1/plx^4 times Δplx. But the number of stars in that volume would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how many stars are in a range Δplx at a given plx? Or maybe the number per unit parallax.

But the number of stars in the volume dV is n * dV. And dV is 4π (1/(plx^2)) (Δplx/(plx^2)) ), which is 4π Δplx / plx^4.

So, the number of stars is n * (4π Δplx / plx^4). So, the number per unit Δplx is proportional to (1/plx^4).

Wait, but the options are in terms of 1/plx^something. So, the number per unit plx range is 1/plx^4? So, the number should go as 1 over plx to the fourth power.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because the number of stars per unit range of plx is (n * volume) / Δplx. Because volume is proportional to Δplx, so when you divide by Δplx, you get (n * 4π) / plx^4.

Wait, no, the number N of stars is n * dV. dV is 4π (d^2) Δd. But Δd is (1/(plx²)) Δplx. So,

N = n * 4π (d^2) (Δd)
= n * 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) (Δplx / plx^2 )
= n * 4π Δplx / plx^4.

So, N is the number of stars in a change Δplx at a given plx. So the number per unit Δplx would be N/Δplx = (n * 4π) / plx^4. So the number density per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, for a given range of plx (like from plx to plx + dplx), how many stars are there? So the count is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So, the answer should be A.

Wait, but another way to think about it. If the distribution is uniform in space, the number of stars in a volume element is constant. So the number per unit volume is constant. The volume element in terms of distance is 4π d² dd. But parallax is plx = 1/d. So, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, d plx is the change in parallax, and dd is the change in distance. Substitute into the volume element: 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 (1/plx² d plx) ) = 4π (1 / plx^4) d plx.

So, the number of stars in that volume is n * (4π / plx^4) d plx. So, the number per unit d plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is option A, ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). For a small change in parallax, \(\Delta \text{plx}\), the corresponding change in distance is \(\Delta d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \Delta \text{plx}\).

The number of stars in a spherical shell of radius \(d\) and thickness \(\Delta d\) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \(4\pi d^2 \Delta d\). Substituting \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\), the volume becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4\pi \Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\(\Delta \text{plx}\)) is:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit } \Delta \text{plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}\). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~1/plx^4**

Answer: A
