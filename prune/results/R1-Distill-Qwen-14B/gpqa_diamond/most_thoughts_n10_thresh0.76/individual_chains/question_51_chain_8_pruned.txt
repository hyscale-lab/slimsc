Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are given, so I'll have to figure out the right formula.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange. Since the sphere is grounded, it can have induced charges. The induced charges will be opposite to q, and their distribution depends on the position of q relative to the sphere.

But wait, the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface must be zero. Oh right, because the ground is at zero potential. So any excess charge on the sphere will redistribute in such a way that the potential on the surface is zero.

But how does this affect the potential energy? Potential energy in a system of charges is related to the work done to assemble the charges. Since the sphere is grounded, maybe some of the work is done by the grounding, which would affect the potential energy.

Let me think about the method to calculate this. One approach is to calculate the potential energy of the charge q in the potential created by the sphere, plus the potential energy stored in the sphere due to its own charges.

Wait, but the sphere is a conductor, so all the induced charges reside on the surface. The inside of the conductor doesn't have any net charge. So when the charge q is placed outside the sphere
