Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we're supposed to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax in astronomy is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (p), so d = 1/p. Wait, no, wait. Parallax p is in arcseconds, and distance d is in parsecs. So actually, d = 1 / p. So if p increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's the number density in terms of parallax. Let me think about how the number of stars depends on distance, which is linked to parallax.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) is uniform. But when considering how they are distributed in terms of parallax, I need to think about how volume relates to parallax.

Wait, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on that volume. So if I have a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4π r² dr (the surface area of a sphere times dr). So the number
