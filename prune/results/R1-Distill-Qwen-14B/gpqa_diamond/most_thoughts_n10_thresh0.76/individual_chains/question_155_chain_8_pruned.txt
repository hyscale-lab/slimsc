Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and I'm given the state vector.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the variance. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to calculate the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

Wait, but the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I can't directly say that ⟨P_z⟩ is zero or anything like that. I have to compute these expectation values from the given state vector.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me note that down. So in Dirac notation, it's |ψ⟩ = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]^T.

The operator P_z is given, right? Let me look at its matrix form. The matrix P_z has the first row as (ħ, 0, 0), the second row as (0,0,0), and the third row as (0,0,-ħ). So P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

So P_z = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ).

To find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since |ψ⟩ is a column vector, let me write it out. Let's denote the components as ψ_1, ψ_2, ψ_3. So ψ_1 = -1/2, ψ_2 = 1/√2, ψ_3 = -1/2.

The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this simplifies things. Each diagonal element multiplies the corresponding component squared.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ_1 * (ħ * ψ_1) + ψ_2 * (0 * ψ_2) ) + ψ_3 * (-ħ * ψ_3 )

Wait, no, wait: Actually, no, the multiplication is the state times P_z times the state. Let me think again. When you have a diagonal matrix, the product P_z |ψ⟩ will multiply each component of |ψ⟩ by the diagonal element.

So |P_z ψ⟩ is a vector where each component is P_z's diagonal element times the corresponding component of |ψ⟩. So the first component is ħ*(-1/2), the second is 0*(1/√2)=0, the third is (-ħ)*(-1/2) = (ħ/2).

So the vector P_z |ψ⟩ is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Then, ⟨P_z⟩ is the inner product of |ψ⟩ with this vector. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = ψ_1 * (-ħ/2) + ψ_2 * 0 + ψ_3 * (ħ/2 )

Plugging in the values:

= (-1/2) * (-ħ/2) + (1/√2) * 0 + (-1/2) * (ħ/2)

Simplify each term:

First term: (1/2) * (ħ/2) = ħ/4

Second term: 0

Third term: (-1/2) * (ħ/2) = -ħ/4

So adding them together: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0.

Wait, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's interesting. So the average of P_z in this state is zero
