Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I'm trying to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit it. Let me go through each compound one by one.

The question lists four compounds, and the options are combinations of them. I remember that optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, compounds with other forms of asymmetry, like planar chirality, can also show optical activity. But I think for this question, we're mainly concerned with chiral centers.

Let me look at each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl structures can have different configurations. If the substituents are on opposite sides or the same side, they can create enantiomers. Wait, but biphenyls can have a phenomenon called cis-trans isomerism, but that's actually a form of stereoisomerism. But does it lead to optical isomerism? I'm a bit confused. I think biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can have different stereoisomerism. If the groups are non-superimposable mirror images, then yes. So if the dinitro and the dicarboxylate groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center or a chiral plane, then it can have enantiomers. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't. So in this compound, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each phenyl ring. Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. But wait, since it's 1,1'-biphenyl, the two rings are connected at position 1. So positions 2 and 6 are on each ring. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule is asymmetric, then it could have enantiomers. So I think this compound can exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself is a meso compound. Wait, if the substituents are symmetrical,
