Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me read it again.

Alright, so Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Oh, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. Interesting, but not sure if mass matters here. The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's probably the peak wavelength due to blackbody radiation. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity... I'm not sure if that affects luminosity directly. Luminosity is intrinsic brightness, which depends on radius and temperature, right? Unless the velocities influence the observed flux, but the problem says they computed the luminosity, which is intrinsic. So maybe the radial velocity doesn't matter here. Or perhaps it's a red herring.

Wait, the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So their luminosity should be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, where R is radius and T is temperature. So the formula for luminosity is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, since both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures are the same. Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So T1 = T2. So I can set T1 and T2 equal to each other.

So L1 = 4πR1²σT⁴ and L2 = 4πR2²σT⁴. Since T is same, when I take the ratio L1/L2, the T terms cancel out.

So L1 / L2 = (R1²) / (R2²). Because 4πσ and T⁴ are same for both. So R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times R2 squared
