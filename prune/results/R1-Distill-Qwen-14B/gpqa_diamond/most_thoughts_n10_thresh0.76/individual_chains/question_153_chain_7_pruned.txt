Okay, so I've got this problem about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the nucleophile is usually something like an enolate or another conjugate base.

The question has three parts: reactions (A), (B), and (C), each with different reactants and conditions. I need to find out the major products for each and match them with the given options.

Starting with reaction A: Dimethyl malonate is one of the reactants. Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3)2C(COOH)2, but as the ester, so it's (CH3)2C(COOEt)2. That's a di-ester. I think dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a strong nucleophile. It can form an enolate.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but here it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, but wait, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt? Or maybe it's CH2-CH2-CO-OEt with the p-tolyl in the middle. Hmm, no, wait, the structure of acrylate is CH₂=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no. The acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So the structure is CH₂=CHCOOEt. But 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would mean that the p-tolyl group is attached to the third carbon? Wait, that's not possible because the acrylate is only three carbons: the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the ester is on
