Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is identified as either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The options are A to D.

The 1H NMR data provided is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I remember that in NMR, the chemical shifts can tell us a lot about the structure. Acetates usually have a carbonyl group, which is probably why I'm seeing the singlet at 2.1 ppm. That’s likely the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (OAc group). So, the compound is an acetate ester, which makes sense.

Now, looking at the other signals. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant J of 16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling, probably between two vinylic protons. Wait, 16 Hz is a bigger value, so maybe it's a trans coupling in a di-substituted double bond. Oh wait, no, wait, in alkenes, the coupling between adjacent protons (vicinal) is typically around 10-18 Hz. So J=16 is in that range. So that's probably between two protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Quadruplets usually arise from coupling with two different sets of protons, each with different J values. So maybe this proton is coupled to two others, each with different couplings. Or perhaps it's a doublet of doublets converted into a quadruplet if the couplings are similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a multiplet from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, but I'm not sure yet.

The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet, 3H. So that must be a methyl group attached to something else, maybe a CH2. Since acetates have a methyl (OAc), but this is another methyl elsewhere.

Let me try to think about the structures of the options. The options are between propenyl and butenyl acetates, and whether they're cis or trans.

Propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group, attached to an acetate. So propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, no, wait, wait. Acetate esters are R-O-CO-O-R, or wait, no, wait, no. No, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R. So propenyl acetate would be the propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-) attached to an oxygen, then a carbonyl, then an acetyl group. Wait, no, acetate is OAc, so the ester would be R-O-COCH3. So propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Similarly, butenyl would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

So the structures for the options would be:

Cis-propenyl acetate: the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2OAc. But wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2- but in the case of propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but that's not a cis or trans isomer because propenyl only has two carbons in the double bond. Wait, no, wait, propenyl has three carbons
