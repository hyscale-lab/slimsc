Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I should figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium with 3 neutrons... Wait, Lithium typically has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that means it's Lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

Now, I need to find the energy of the RHIC. Hmm, I remember that particles in colliders are accelerated to high speeds, and their kinetic energy is a significant part of their total energy. So, I think I need to calculate the kinetic energy of the Li-6 nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the energy of the collider. Since RHIC collides heavy ions, I think each ion is accelerated to a certain energy. So for each nucleus, their total energy would include their rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but in relativistic terms, it's probably better to work with the total energy (gamma * m c²) and then perhaps subtract the rest energy to get the kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes in collider problems, the given energy is the kinetic energy. Hmm, not sure yet.

But the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." I think in colliders, the energy refers to the kinetic energy per particle. Or wait, perhaps it's the total energy. I need to clarify that. Let me think.

In high-energy physics, when they talk about beam energy, it's usually the kinetic energy. But in some contexts, it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I should proceed with the total energy because when you're dealing with speeds close to c, the gamma factor plays a significant role.

So, the formula I should use is the total energy E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Here, v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.9216.

Let me compute gamma first. So, 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

But wait, wait. Let's compute it more accurately. Maybe 0.0784's square root is exactly 0.28. Yes, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/(0.28) = approximately 3.57142857...

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Li has an atomic number of 3, so the nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 1.007276 GeV/c², and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c².

So the total mass of X is:

3 * (proton mass) + 3 * (neutron mass) = 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. Let me check that calculation again. 1.007276 + 1.008665 = 2.015941. Multiply by 3 gives 6.047823 GeV/c².

So m = 6.047823 GeV/c².

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m c². Since c² is in the units, and the mass is in GeV/c², E would be gamma * m.

So E = gamma * m = 3.57142857 * 6.047823 GeV.

Let me compute that. Let's compute 3.57142857 * 6.047823.

First, 3.5 * 6 is 21. So 3.5714 * 6.0478 ≈ ?

Calculating:

3.57142857 * 6.047823.

Well, let's compute it step by step.

3.5714 * 6 = 21.4284.

3.5714 * 0.047823 = ?

Hmm, 3.5714 *0.04 = 0.142856.

3.5714 *0.007823 = approx 0.027855.

So total is 0.142856 + 0.027855 ≈ 0.170711.

So 21.4284 + 0.170711 ≈ 21.5991 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me try exact multiplication.

3.57142857 * 6.047823.

Let me think in terms of exact calculation:

6.047823 * 3 = 18.143469

6.047823 * 0.57142857 ≈ ?

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7, which is about 0.57142857.

So 6.047823 * (4/7) = (6.047823 *4)/7 = 24.191292 /7 ≈ 3.455899.

So adding 18.143469 + 3.455899 ≈ 21.599368 GeV.

So approximately 21.599 GeV.

Wait, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419

Hmm, none of the options are 21.599. So either I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me recompute gamma.

v = 0.96c

v²/c² = 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of the proton and neutron.

The mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², which is 0.938272 GeV/c².

Wait, wait, I think I might have used the wrong mass values earlier. Let me double-check the masses.

Proton mass: approximately 1.007276 GeV/c²? Wait, no, wait. No, I think I confused grams and GeV. Let me think: 1 GeV is about 1.78x10^-27 kg. The proton mass is about 1.67e-27 kg, which is approximately 938 MeV/c², which is 0.938 GeV/c².

Ah, so I made a mistake earlier. The proton mass is about 0.938 GeV/c², not 1.007 GeV/c². Oh no! That changes everything.

Wait, wait. Wait, perhaps I confused the mass in atomic mass units. Because 1 atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c², which is 0.9315 GeV/c².

Wait, the proton's mass is approximately 1.007276 u. So that's 1.007276 * 0.9315 GeV/c².

Let me compute that. 1.007276 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.93827 GeV/c². So the proton's mass is about 0.93827 GeV/c².

Similarly, the neutron's mass is about 1.008665 u, so that's 1.008665 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.94045 GeV/c².

So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total mass is:

3 * 0.93827 + 3 * 0.94045 = 3*(0.93827 + 0.94045) = 3*(1.87872) = 5.63616 GeV/c².

Wait, that's a big difference. Earlier I thought the mass was around 6 GeV/c², but now it's about 5.636 GeV/c².

So then, the gamma is 3.5714, as before.

So the total energy E is gamma * m c², which in our units is gamma * m.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.63616 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857.

3.5714 * 0.63616 ≈ let's calculate:

0.63616 * 3 = 1.90848.

0.63616 * 0.5714 ≈ approximately 0.63616 * 0.5 = 0.31808, 0.63616 *0.0714 ≈ approx 0.0455. So total ≈ 0.31808 + 0.0455 = 0.36358.

So 1.90848 + 0.36358 ≈ 2.27206.

So adding 17.857 + 2.27206 ≈ 20.129 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.129 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, let me compute 3.57142857 *5.63616 exactly.

Let me do the multiplication step by step.

5.63616 *3 = 16.90848

5.63616 *0.57142857.

0.57142857 is 4/7. So 5.63616 *4 = 22.54464. Then divided by 7: 22.54464 /7 ≈ 3.220662857.

So total is 16.90848 +3.220662857 ≈ 20.12914286 GeV.

So approximately 20.129 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So that's the closest.

But wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach. Because in some cases, the energy given in colliders refers to the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, that's another possibility. Let me think: in particle accelerators, sometimes the energy given is the kinetic energy (K), so the total energy is E = K + m c².

In that case, if the problem refers to the RHIC's energy as the kinetic energy, then K = gamma m c² - m c² = (gamma -1) m c².

So in this case, K would be (3.5714 -1) * m c² = 2.5714 * m.

So let's compute that. m was 5.63616 GeV/c².

So K = 2.5714 *5.63616 ≈ ?

2 *5.63616 =11.27232

0.5714 *5.63616 ≈ 3.2206 (since 5.63616 *0.5714 ≈ 3.2206 as before)

So K ≈ 11.27232 +3.2206 ≈14.4929 GeV.

But this value isn't in the options, so perhaps I was correct earlier that the energy refers to the total energy, not the kinetic.

Hmm, but the options include 20.132 GeV, which matches our first calculation when using the correct masses.

So why was there a discrepancy earlier? Because I initially used proton and neutron masses as ~1 GeV each, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to use their masses as around 0.938 GeV for protons and 0.940 GeV for neutrons, leading to a Li-6 nucleus mass of about 5.636 GeV/c².

So the correct energy is around 20.129 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close, considering the precision required is 1e-4.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the nucleus**: Lithium-6 (Li-6) consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, giving it a total of 6 nucleons.

2. **Calculate the rest mass energy of Li-6**:  
   - The mass of a proton is approximately \( 0.93827 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).  
   - The mass of a neutron is approximately \( 0.94045 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).  
   - The total rest mass energy of Li-6 is:  
     \[
     m = 3 \cdot (0.93827) + 3 \cdot (0.94045) = 5.63616 \, \text{GeV}/c^2.
     \]

3. **Determine the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:  
   - The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \).  
   - Using the formula for \(\gamma\):  
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
     \]

4. **Calculate the total energy of the nucleus**:  
   - The total energy is given by \( E = \gamma \cdot m \).  
   - Substituting the values:  
     \[
     E = 3.5714 \cdot 5.63616 \approx 20.129 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

5. **Compare with the options**:  
   - The calculated energy \( 20.129 \, \text{GeV} \) is closest to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)), considering the precision required is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \).

Thus, the energy of the RHIC for the Li-6 nucleus moving at \( 0.96c \) is approximately \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \).
