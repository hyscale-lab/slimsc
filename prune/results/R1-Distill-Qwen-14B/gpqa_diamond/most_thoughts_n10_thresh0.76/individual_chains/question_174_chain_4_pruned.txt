Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission. Hmm, I've studied a bit about nuclear physics, but I'm a bit rusty so I need to think carefully.

The question says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, and nothing else. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

Wait, wait. Let me parse this. So the original nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. That's a lot, but I'm more interested in the masses of the fragments. The sum of their rest masses is 0.99 M. So each fragment's mass is less than the original because some mass is converted into energy during the fission. But wait, actually, in reality, mass might increase because binding energy is released, but here the sum is less than M, so maybe some mass is lost as energy.

Wait, no, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So, M_initial = m1 + m2 + (energy released as mass deficit). Because in nuclear reactions, the rest mass can decrease because some of it is converted into kinetic energy of the products. So the total rest mass after is less than before.

So, M_initial = M. The sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M. So the mass deficit is 0.01 M.

The fragments have a mass ratio of 2:1. Let me denote the less massive fragment's mass as m, so the more massive is 2m. So 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. So the masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. The sum is 0.99 M, so 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.33 M. So the two fragments are 0.666... M and 0.333... M.

Wait, but those are their rest masses. So m1 = 2m = 0.666... M, m2 = 0.3
