Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with NMR and reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, the molecular formula tells me something about the structure. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, substituting:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. So could be a combination like a ring and double bonds or multiple double bonds.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H), 6.98 (doublet, 2H), 6.51 (doublet, 2H), 6.27 (broad singlet, 2H), 3.66 (doublet, 2H).

Hmm, let's try to figure out what each peak corresponds to. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is quite upfield... Wait, no, 9.7 is actually a high ppm, which is typical for an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So this must be an aldehyde group. The triplet suggests it's coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehydes typically have a singlet because the adjacent carbon doesn't have any hydrogens (like RCHO). Unless in some specific cases, like conjugated systems or when the aldehyde is part of a ring... Hmm, but maybe that's not right. Or perhaps the triplet comes from coupling with two equivalent protons elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's an enol or some kind of conjugated system. But let me think again. The aldehyde is at 9.72, triplet. So, maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group or something. Because if the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2, each proton on CH2 would split it into a triplet. Because each H on CH2 would split the aldehyde into a doublet, but being coupled with two equivalent Hs (as in a CH2 group), it would be a triplet. So that makes sense.

So perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group next to a CH2, like R-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but let me look at the other peaks. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets. Those are in the aromatic region. So maybe we have two sets of aromatic rings. The 6.98 is a doublet (2H), and 6.51 is also a doublet (2H). So perhaps there's a para-substituted aromatic ring, where the two protons are each as doublets. Like a para-substituted benzene where each pair of H's is next to substituents.

Wait, if it's a para-substituted ring, each pair of H's would be equivalent, giving a doublet for each. So maybe the compound has two aromatic rings, each para-substituted. Or perhaps one ring with substituents that are
