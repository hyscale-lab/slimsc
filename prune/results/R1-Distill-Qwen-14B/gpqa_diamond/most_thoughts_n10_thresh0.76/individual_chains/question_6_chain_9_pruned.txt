Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle in a certain potential. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Okay, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, so it's a two-dimensional problem in polar coordinates. I remember that in such cases, sometimes the potential can be separable, allowing us to solve the Schrödinger equation by treating each coordinate separately.

Wait, looking at the potential, I see that it's made up of two terms: one is just (1/2)kr², which is like a harmonic oscillator potential in radial direction, and the other is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The cos²θ part makes me think about angular dependence. Oh, right! The cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos squared theta is (1 + cos2θ)/2. So, let me rewrite that:

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Wait, let me compute that. So 3/2 times (1 + cos2θ)/2 is (3/4)(1 + cos2θ). So the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Wait, adding the terms, (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4) kr². So the potential is (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Or, factor kr²:

V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² [1 + (3/5) cos2θ ].

Hmm, but wait, maybe I should think about this potential in terms of effective potentials or perhaps in terms of known potentials. Alternatively, maybe I can separate the radial and angular parts more directly.

Wait, another approach. For a central potential, the radial and angular parts are typically separated, and the energy depends on both the radial quantum number and the angular momentum. But in this case, the potential has both r² and angular terms, which complicates things.

Let me consider the form of the potential. The first term is (1/
