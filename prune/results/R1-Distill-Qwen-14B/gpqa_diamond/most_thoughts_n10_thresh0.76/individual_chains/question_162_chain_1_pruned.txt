Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformal metric because it's a scalar multiple of the flat metric. Conformal metrics are like scaling the standard Euclidean metric by some function. Right, so the general form is ds² = E²(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where E is the conformal factor.

But wait, conformal factors are usually positive, right? So in this case, 32/(4 - x² - y²) needs to be positive. Which means the denominator 4 - x² - y² should be positive as well because 32 is positive. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 implies x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Oh, that makes sense because the pseudosphere radius is 2.

Wait, but what exactly is a pseudosphere in this context? I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric given might be representing that. So the metric would have a negative curvature.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere... Normally, the area of a sphere is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, maybe it's different. Wait, pseudospheres have infinite area? Or maybe the given metric is something else.
