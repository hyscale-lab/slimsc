Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me think through each star step by step.

First, I remember that both observatories have different magnitude limits for their spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17, which means it can see stars with V magnitudes up to but not exceeding 17. HIRES has a lower limit, only up to V=16. So any star that's brighter than 16 mag (i.e., has a lower numerical value) can be seen by both, but if it's fainter than 16 mag, HIRES can't see it, so only ESPRESSO can.

Now, each star's information is given, so I'll go through each one.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc. Since it's already at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is the same as absolute, so V=15.5. Both 15.5 is less than 16 and 17, so it's detectable by both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V magnitude is 16.5. 16.5 is above 16, so HIRES can't detect it. But 16.5 is below 17, so ESPRESSO can. So only ESPRESSO can see Star2.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5. But wait, it has E(B-V)=0.6. The total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the apparent magnitude would be dimmer by that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the star's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but there's extinction. So the observed V magnitude would be higher, because extinction makes stars appear fainter. So the actual apparent mag without extinction would be lower. Oh wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference in the star's colors due to dust. The extinction in V band (A_V) is 3.1 * E(B-V). So if the star's uncorrected apparent magnitude is m, then the observed magnitude is m + A_V. Wait no, wait, wait. Let me recall: the formula is m - M = 5 log (d/10) + A_V. Because the star's light is dimmed by distance (distance modulus) and by dust (extinction).

Wait, but in the question, Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but that must be the observed (extincted) magnitude. Wait, no. Let me read the question again. The question says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which includes the extinction. So the actual unreddened apparent magnitude would be m_true = observed m - A_V.

Wait, no, wait: when you have extinction, the star appears dimmer. So the observed apparent magnitude is larger (because lower brightness means higher magnitude). So apparent magnitude (observed) = m_true + A_V.

So if the observed V magnitude is 15.5, that's after extinction. The intrinsic V magnitude would be 15.5 - A_V, where A_V is 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 *0.6 = 1.86. So intrinsic m = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64 mag. So the actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be 13.64, which is brighter than 15.5. So if we correct for extinction, Star3's true apparent magnitude is 13.64, which is less than 16, so it's observable by both. Because without extinction, it's 13.64, which is within both telescopes' limits.

Wait, but wait, how does this affect detection? Because the telescope's limit is the observed apparent magnitude. So without considering extinction, which one can detect the star?

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me clarify. When a star is observed, the apparent magnitude we measure is affected by extinction. So if a star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true, the observed (with extinction) is m_obs = m_true + A_V.

So if the question gives the apparent magnitude as 15.5, that includes the extinction. So for Star3, the observed V mag is 15.5, which includes the extinction. So without extinction, it would appear brighter. But the detection is based on the observed magnitude. 

So to determine if a telescope can detect it, we look at the observed magnitude.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says that for each star, what is their apparent V magnitude as observed. Because if the star is intrinsically bright but is behind a lot of dust, the observed magnitude is higher (fainter). So the limit is based on the observed magnitude. So if the observed V is 16.5, that's fainter than HIRES's limit of 16. So the question is about whether the observed magnitude is below the limit.

Wait, but the description says that for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. That is, V <=17. Similarly, HIRES requires V <=16.

So for a star to be detected by both, its observed V magnitude must be <=16.

So looking back, each star's observed V must be <=16 to be detected by HIRES, and <=17 for ESPRESSO.

So for Star1: apparent V is 15.5, which is <=16, so both can detect.

Star2: apparent V is 16.5. So ESPRESSO can (<=17) but HIRES cannot (needs <=16). So only ESPRESSO can detect.

Star3: Observed V is 15.5, so both can detect.

Wait, but Star3's E(B-V) is given. But the question says that the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which includes extinction
