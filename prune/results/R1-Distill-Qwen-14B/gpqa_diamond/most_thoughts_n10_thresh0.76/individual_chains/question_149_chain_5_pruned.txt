Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.

The question says that there's a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. So, the integration suggests that each peak is about 0.5H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So what could cause the same proton to split into two peaks?

Wait, if they're the same alpha proton, maybe it's something to do with diastereotopic protons? Or perhaps it's an issue with the sample's stereochemistry.

Looking at the LC-MS data, the crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, which is the expected molecular ion. So, same mass but two peaks. That suggests maybe isomers—either diastereomers or enantiomers. Because enantiomers would have the same mass and same retention times? Wait, but if it's LC, maybe they are separated. Oh, but the same mass would fit either way.

Wait, the question says LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature. Hmm, higher temperatures can sometimes cause more separation because of better solubility or something else. Or maybe it's about the mobile phase conditions. But regardless, the main point is two peaks, same mass.

So possible explanations: if the compound is a racemic mixture, then the enantiomers would have same mass but same retention times? Wait, no, in LC, they might elute at the same time because the column can't distinguish enantiomers unless it's a chiral column. Oh wait, the question states that the LC-MS shows two peaks. So if it's a normal column (not chiral), the enantiomers might come out as one peak because they're not separated. Wait, but the question says two equal peaks, so maybe the column is chiral, allowing separation of enantiomers. But then, the question says the mass spectrum is the same. So same mass, same structure—so they must be enantiomers.

But wait, the options are looking for the cause of the NMR as well. The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. Why would that happen?

If the compound is a racemic mixture, then in the NMR you might not see splitting unless the environment is different. Wait, but in a racemic mixture, the two enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because they are mirror images. So you wouldn't see two peaks for the same proton because each molecule is identical in that aspect. Or wait, maybe the enantiomers are in a solution that's not completely pure, but that wouldn't cause two peaks for the same proton.

Alternatively, if the compound exists as diastereomers, then their NMR would show different shifts. But in this case, the two peaks have similar shifts, so maybe diastereomers is not the cause because diastereomers often have different chemical shifts.

Wait, but the peaks are for the same alpha proton, so same shift would imply similar environments. So if the two molecules are diastereomers, the same proton might be in a slightly different environment, leading to different shifts.
