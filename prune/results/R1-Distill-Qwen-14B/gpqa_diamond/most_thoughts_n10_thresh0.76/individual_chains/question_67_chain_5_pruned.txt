Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. Two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. Wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has l1 and l2 equal to 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. So the state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, which is 2, and m is -1. 

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ.

Wait, orbital angular momentum. For each electron, Lz has eigenvalues m1ħ and m2ħ, where m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1 for l=1. So each electron's Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. 

The state is a coupled state, meaning it's a combination of the product states of individual states. So I think I need to expand this coupled state in terms of the product states of the individual L1z and L2z eigenstates.

The coupled state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. To find the expansion, I should write it as a sum of |m1, m2>
