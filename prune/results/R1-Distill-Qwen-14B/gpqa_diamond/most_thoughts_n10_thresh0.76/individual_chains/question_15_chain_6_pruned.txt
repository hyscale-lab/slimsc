Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me think.

The question says both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has an orbital period P, Planet_1's is P/3.

They also have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things because eccentricity affects transit probability but here it's zero for both. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. Oh, right, the formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is edge-on enough. 

Wait, but wait. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view) is given by the formula: 

Probability ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a AU)) [But I might be getting that wrong. Or is it more about the relative sizes and the orbital inclination?]

Wait, I think the transit probability for a given system is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (b^2 + 1)) where b is the impact parameter, which depends on the orientation. But actually, the maximum probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)), but I'm not fully remembering. Alternatively, for a circular orbit, the probability that the inclination is such that it transits is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / ( (a) * (something) )).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recall the formula. The transit probability P is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / ( (a) * sin i )) 

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The probability that the planet transits is actually the ratio of the area where the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge
