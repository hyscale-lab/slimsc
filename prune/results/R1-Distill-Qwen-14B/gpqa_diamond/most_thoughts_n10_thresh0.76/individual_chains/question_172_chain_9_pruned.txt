Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, does that mean the excitation energy is twice, or the number of excited atoms is twice? I think it refers to the excitation level in terms of population, like the number of atoms in a specific energy level. Oh, right, because when we talk about excitation, it's about how many atoms are in higher energy states compared to lower ones.

I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations, E the energies, k_B the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

In this case, for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let's clarify: if star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state as star_2, then n1 / n2 = 2. Or wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level." So perhaps the ratio of excited to unexcited is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. Or maybe the excitation level is higher because the temperature is higher.

Wait, but the question mentions that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So that's E = 1.38e-23 J.

So, the ratio of populations in the higher energy level (excited state) to the lower one would be given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me model this.

For star_1: ratio r1 = (n1_excited) / (n1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )

Similarly, for star_2: r2 = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

The question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So, r1 = 2 * r2.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me read the question again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2's. Or perhaps the excitation energy is twice as much, but that seems less likely. But more likely, it's the population ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is twice, meaning that the ratio of excited to ground state is 2 in star_1 and 1 in star_2? Not sure. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: suppose the excitation is such that for star_1, the ratio of the excited level (E) to the lower level (E=0) is twice as much as that for star_2. Wait, that's not quite correct. Alternatively, maybe the number of excited atoms
