Okay, so I have this problem in front of me about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me see. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent and forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The stoichiometric complex here means that each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA molecule. So the complex is CaY²- perhaps, where Y is the EDTA.

Wait, the formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10. I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. So Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, what's the initial condition here? The solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That means [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M, right?

The thing is, how much of that complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-? Because the formation constant is large (5e10), which suggests that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation would be minimal.

So, I should set up the equation. Let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Since each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of free EDTA would be x as well. So the complex's concentration would be 0.02 - x, but because K is so large, x would be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, we can approximate [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 M.

So, putting into the formation constant equation: Kf = 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02/(x²)

So, solving for x: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13, so sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because 6.5 *2 =13. Hmm, but 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7 (since 1e-7 is 1e-7, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 1e-6.5 is about 3e-7). So sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5 = 2 *3.16e-7 =6.32e-7.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Which would mean the concentration of Ca²+ ions is about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The setup: Kf is [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]). Since the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming [Ca] and [EDTA] are both x, so Kf = 0.02/(x²) → x²=0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 =2e-2, 2e-2/(5e10)=4e-13, so x= sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5= approx 6.3e-7.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

Here, \( K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} \). The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \)). Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \( x \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
