Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about IUPAC naming. Hmm, benzene rings can be tricky, but let's break it down step by step. Alright, the question describes a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Then there are some other groups attached ortho and para to the carboxylic acid, and some of these are also ortho to the nitrile. 

Wait, let me visualize this. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group, which I'll consider as the first substituent. Since the other two substituents (carbaldehyde and cyano) are meta to each other and to the carboxylic acid, that means each is separated by two carbons. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the cyano and aldehyde would be at 3 and 5, or maybe vice versa? Wait, but the problem says they are all meta to one another, so perhaps each is two positions apart. Hmm, wait, all meta means each is meta to the others? Or that each substituent is meta to the others? I might need to think about that.

Wait, no, the question states: "a benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another." So each is meta to the others. So that implies that each substituent is separated by two positions. But wait
