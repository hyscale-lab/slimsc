Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about nucleophilicity. Hmm, I need to arrange these nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive in an aqueous solution. Let me think about what I remember regarding nucleophilicity trends.

First, the nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH₃OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)

Wait, no, wait. Methanol is CH3OH. Oh, and Ethanethiolate is the thiolate, so HS⁻, right.

I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent. In such solvents, the ability of a nucleophile to donate electrons is influenced by solvation. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents, but in polar protic, solvation can stabilize the nucleophile, sometimes hindering its reactivity.

So in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is usually I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ because F⁻ is a stronger base and gets more solvated, making it less reactive. But wait, that's for halides. But in this case, the nucleophiles are different.

Let me think about the general trends. In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order for different types of nucleophiles is influenced by their charge and size. More charged and larger nucleophiles tend to be better because they're less solvated than smaller ones. Also, the ability to stabilize the charge through resonance or inductive effects can play a role.

Looking at the given nucleophiles:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): This is a thiolate ion. Thiols are generally better nucleophiles than alcohols because sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so the thiolate ion is a stronger base and a better nucleophile. Also, in polar protic solvents, HS⁻ is less solvated than OH⁻ because sulfur is larger, so it's more reactive.

2. Hydroxide (OH⁻): This is a strong base. In aqueous solution, it's a good nucleophile, but maybe not the best because it's highly solvated. Wait, but compared to other ions here, how does it stack up?

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's an alkoxide ion. Alkoxide ions are strong bases, but in polar protic solvents, their nucleophilicity might be affected by solvation. Also, the structure might influence the basicity. 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a bulky base, so maybe it's less reactive? Or wait, steric hindrance might make it a weaker base, but in terms of nucleophilicity, is that more of a substitution issue? Hmm.

3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻): The propionate ion is the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weak base compared to hydroxide or thiolate. Since it's a larger, weaker base, its nucleophilicity in polar protic solvent would be lower than the others.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): This is a neutral molecule. Neutral substances are generally weaker nucleophiles in polar protic solvents because they're not as good at stabilizing the transition state. They're less reactive than their deprotonated counterparts.

So let's try to order them. The most reactive nucleophile should be the one that's least solvated and a strong base. So the thiolate (HS⁻) is more nucleophilic than hydroxide (OH⁻) because thiolate is a weaker base but in a polar protic solvent, the larger size means less solvation. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in aqueous solution, which is a protic solvent, the basicity and solvation both matter. Thiols are weaker bases than alcohols because their conjugate acids (thiols) are stronger acids. Wait, no: actually, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because H2S is a weaker acid than water. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: the conjugate acid of HS⁻ is H2S. The conjugate acid of OH⁻ is H2O. Since H2O is a weaker acid than H2S, that means OH⁻ is a weaker base than HS⁻? Wait, no, actually, pKa values can help. The pKa of H2O is around 15.7, and the pKa of H2S is around 7. So H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. Therefore, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Because for a stronger acid (H2S), the conjugate base (HS⁻) is weaker. So since OH⁻ is the conjugate base of a weaker acid (H2O), it's a stronger base.

Wait, but in terms of nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents, the trend is that weaker bases (but more polarizable) can be better nucleophiles. For example, iodide is a weaker base than hydroxide but is a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents because it's less solvated. So perhaps HS⁻, being a weaker base than OH⁻, might be a better nucleophile in aqueous solution? Because it is less solvated?

Wait, but wait. Let me think. HS⁻ is a larger ion than OH⁻. So in a polar protic solvent like water, the solvation around HS⁻ would be less efficient because of its larger size. That means HS⁻ would be less stabilized (less solvated) and more reactive as a nucleophile. So HS⁻ (ethanethiolate) would be a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in water.

So the order starts with HS⁻ (5) as the most reactive.

Next, OH⁻ (2) is a strong base but gets heavily solvated, making it less reactive than HS⁻ but more reactive than other nucleophiles.

Then, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is an alkoxide. Alkoxides are strong bases, but steric hindrance (like the 4-methyl group) might make it less basic and less nucleophilic. But wait, steric hindrance affects the base strength, but in terms of nucleophilicity, maybe the bulk makes it a poorer nucleophile because it can't approach the electrophilic center as easily. Alternatively, perhaps the bulk makes the molecule more stabilized, but I think in this case, the 4-methyl group would hinder the nucleophilic attack, making it less reactive than OH⁻ but maybe more than the others.

Wait, but another thing: the structure of 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky anion. So the lone pair is in a more hindered environment. That might lead to less effective nucleophilicity because the lone pair is less accessible. So perhaps this is less reactive than OH⁻ and HS⁻ but more than the others.

Next would be propionate (3), which is a conjugate base of a weak acid. Propionate is a weaker base than all the others except maybe methanol. Since it's the conjugate base of propionic acid (pKa around 4.88), propionate is a weaker base than OH⁻, HS⁻, cyclohexanolate, and I think even methanol is a weaker base than that. Wait, methanol is a neutral alcohol; its conjugate acid is CH3OH2+, with a pKa around 19.7. Propionate's conjugate acid has pKa ~4.88. So propionate is a weaker base than the others except maybe if any are stronger. Wait, wait, OH⁻ is a stronger base than any of these. So in terms of basicity, order from strongest to weakest is: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (since it's an alkoxide, very strong base), then OH⁻, then HS⁻ (since H2S is a stronger acid, so HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻?), wait no, earlier I thought HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because H2S is a stronger acid.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The strength of the base is inversely related to the strength of the conjugate acid. So stronger acid → weaker conjugate base.

H2O has a pKa ~15.7. H2S has a pKa ~7. So H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. Therefore, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So the order of basicity is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strong base, very reactive as a base)

OH⁻ (moderately strong base)

HS⁻ (weaker base than OH⁻)

Propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻), which is the conjugate base of propionic acid (pKa ~4.88), so that's a weaker base than HS⁻.

Wait, no. Wait, propionic acid has a pKa of about 4.88, so its conjugate base (propionate) is a stronger base than HS⁻, which has a conjugate acid (H2S) with pKa ~7.

Wait, no. Wait, the conjugate base strength: the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base.

So if H2S (pKa ~7) is a stronger acid than propionic acid (pKa ~4.88), wait no, lower pKa is stronger acid. So H2S is stronger acid than propionic acid? Because 7 is higher than 4.88. So H2S is a stronger acid than propionic acid. Therefore, HS⁻ is a weaker base than the propionate ion.

Wait, no, because if H2S is stronger acid (lower pH?), no, wait, wait. Let me get this right. If Acid A has a lower pKa than Acid B, then Acid A is stronger, so its conjugate base is weaker.

So H2S has a pKa ~7, propionic acid about 4.88. Wait, wait, no, wait, propionic acid's pKa is around 4.88. So propionic acid is a stronger acid than H2S because 4.88 < 7. Wait, no, wait, lower pKa means stronger acid. So propionic acid is stronger, so its conjugate base (propionate) is weaker than HS⁻. Because H2S is weaker acid (pKa 7), so HS⁻ is stronger base than propionate.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again.

Given: Acid strength: stronger acid → weaker conjugate base.

So, if Acid X has a lower pKa than Acid Y, then Acid X is stronger, and its conjugate base is weaker.

So, propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) is stronger than H2S (pKa ~7). Therefore, propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻.

Wait, that's correct. So the order of basicity from strongest to weakest is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (alkoxide) > OH⁻ > HS⁻ (ethanethiolate) > propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻) > methanol (CH3OH).

But wait, methanol is a neutral molecule. Its conjugate acid is CH3OH2+ with pKa ~19.7. So methanol's conjugate acid is weaker than propionic acid (pKa ~4.88), so methanol is a weaker base than propionate? No, wait, no, because methanol is a neutral molecule, so it's not a conjugate base. Its conjugate acid has a pKa of ~19.7, which is higher than propionic acid, so propionic acid is a stronger acid than methanol. That means propionate is a weaker base than methanol's conjugate base. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should think in terms of pKa of the conjugate acids.

Wait, the pKa of the conjugate acid of a base tells us about the base strength. The lower the pKa of the conjugate acid, the weaker the base. So, for OH⁻, the conjugate acid is H2O (pKa ~15.7). For HS⁻, the conjugate acid is H2S (pKa ~7). So OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻ because H2O is a weaker acid (higher pKa) than H2S.

For propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻), the conjugate acid is CH2CH2COOH, which has a pKa around 4.88. So propionate's conjugate acid is stronger (lower pKa) than H2S (pKa 7), which means propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻.

Methanol (CH3OH) is not a base in solution because it's a neutral molecule. Its conjugate acid, CH3OH2+, has a pKa around 19.7, which is much higher. So methanol is a weaker base than propionate, which is weaker than HS⁻, which is weaker than OH⁻, which is weaker than the alkoxide.

So the basicity order is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base) > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > propionate > methanol (weakest base).

But nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents doesn't always follow basicity because of solvation effects. In polar protic solvents, larger, weaker bases are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated.

So the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (polar protic) would have the larger, weaker bases higher.

Let's list the nucleophiles with their size and basicity:

5. HS⁻ (larger, weaker base)
2. OH⁻ (smaller, stronger base)
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (large, strong base)
3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻) (medium size, weak base)
4. Methanol (neutral, very weak base)

Wait, but wait, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a large anion, but it's a strong base. So in a polar protic solvent, it's heavily solvated, making it less nucleophilic than a weaker base that's less solvated.

So nucleophilicity order in polar protic solvents: weaker bases (but less solvated) are better nucleophiles.

So let me arrange them:

HS⁻ (5): large, weaker base → least solvated → most nucleophilic.

OH⁻ (2): small, strong base → highly solvated → less nucleophilic than HS⁻ but more than others.

Propionate (3): medium size, weak base → more solvated than HS⁻, less than OH⁻? Not sure. Wait, propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻, so in polar aprotic, it would be worse, but in polar protic, perhaps it's more nucleophilic than the others except the first two?

Wait, but wait. The order for nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents (like water) is usually: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. But that's for halides. For other nucleophiles, the trend is different.

Another approach: in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity (for different types of ions) is often that the weaker bases are better nucleophiles because they're less stabilized by solvation. So, among the given ions:

HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile in water.

Then comes OH⁻, which is a stronger base but more solvated, so it's less reactive than HS⁻.

Next would be the alkoxide (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate). Wait, but wait, the alkoxide is a stronger base than OH⁻. So in aqueous solution, it's more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile than OH⁻. But wait, is the 4-methyl group making it bulkier and perhaps less reactive? Because steric hindrance can reduce nucleophilicity.

So 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a strong base but might be a poor nucleophile due to both being highly solvated and perhaps bulky. So its nucleophilicity would be lower than OH⁻ but higher than propionate.

Wait, but another factor: the ability to donate electrons. Alkoxides have a negative charge on an oxygen atom, which is more electronegative than sulfur. But in this case, I'm trying to compare HS⁻, OH⁻, and the alkoxide.

Wait, perhaps the order is: HS⁻ > OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me think about the actual reactivity. I know that thiols are more nucleophilic than alcohols in polar protic solvents because the S atom is larger and less tightly held by solvation compared to O. So HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

Then, OH⁻ is next. Then comes the alkoxide (1) — but wait, the alkoxide is a stronger base than OH⁻, but in aqueous solution, it's more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile. So maybe its nucleophilicity is lower than OH⁻. But wait, the 4-methyl group increases the size, making the structure bulkier. So, the 4-methylcyclohexanolate ion is a strong base but may not be a great nucleophile because of poor solvation and steric hindrance. So perhaps it's less nucleophilic than OH⁻ but more than the others.

Then, propionate (3): it's a weaker base than the alkoxide, OH⁻, and HS⁻. So in aqueous solution, it's less nucleophilic than all except methanol.

Methanol (4) is a neutral molecule, so it's the least reactive as a nucleophile because it doesn't have a negative charge and is not as effective in polar protic solvents.

Putting it all together:

Most reactive (strongest nucleophile): HS⁻ (5)

Next: OH⁻ (2)

Next: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)

Wait, no, wait. Earlier I thought that the alkoxide is a stronger base than OH⁻, but in aqueous solution, it's more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile. So perhaps the order is 5 > 2 > 1.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of some examples.

In aqueous solution, the thiolate ion is a better nucleophile than hydroxide. For example, in SN2 reactions, ethanethiolate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide.

So 5 > 2.

Then, the alkoxide (1) — but it's a bulky base. Bulky bases are less nucleophilic because of steric hindrance. So perhaps 1 is less reactive than 2. So the order would be 5 > 2 > 1.

Next, propionate (3). It's a weak base, so in aqueous solution, it's less reactive than the others except for methanol.

Methanol (4) is the least reactive because it's neutral.

So the order would be: 5 > 2 > 1 > 3 >4.

Wait, but what about propionate? Propionate is a larger ion than OH⁻, but it's a weaker base. In aqueous solution, maybe it's less reactive than 1 (the alkoxide) but more than methanol.

Wait, but propionate is a conjugate base of a weak acid (pKa ~4.88). So propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻, OH⁻, and the alkoxide. But in aqueous solution, it's a better nucleophile than methanol because it's an ion, albeit a weaker one.

So the order is:

5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a strong base but in aqueous solution, it's very solvated, making it less reactive than OH⁻. So perhaps 2 is more reactive than 1.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

In aqueous (polar protic) solution, the nucleophilicity order for some common ions is as follows:

HS⁻ > I⁻ > RO⁻ > OH⁻ > F⁻.

Wait, no, that can't be right because I remember that in polar protic solvents, the order is I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻, but for other nucleophiles like RO⁻ and OH⁻, the order is influenced by their basicity and solvation.

Wait, another approach: the more stable the conjugate acid, the weaker the base, and the better the nucleophile in polar protic solvents (since less solvated).

So for the given nucleophiles:

HS⁻ (conjugate acid H2S, pKa ~7) → weaker base than OH⁻ (conjugate acid H2O, pKa ~15.7), so HS⁻ is a weaker base but a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

OH⁻ (strong base) → more solvated → lower nucleophilicity than HS⁻.

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: strong base → highly solvated → lower nucleophilicity than HS⁻ and maybe even OH⁻.

Propionate: weaker base than OH⁻ and HS⁻ → less solvated, so better nucleophilicity than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate? Wait, no, because propionate is a weaker base than the alkoxide but stronger than methanol.

Wait, maybe the order is 5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4 → 5,2,3,1,4

B) 2,5,1,4,3 → 2,5,1,4,3

C) 2,5,3,4,3 → Not possible, same number twice.

D)5,2,1,3,4 → 5,2,1,3,4.

So according to my earlier thought, the order would be 5>2>1>3>4, which matches option D.

Wait, but does 1 come before 3?

The nucleophilicity order would be:

1. Ethanethiolate (5) → most reactive.

2. Hydroxide (2).

3. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1).

4. Propionate (3).

5. Methanol (4).

So the order is 5,2,1,3,4.

Looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

So the correct option would be D.


To determine the nucleophilicity of the given nucleophiles in an aqueous (polar protic) solution, we consider factors such as basicity, solvation, and steric hindrance. In polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity trends are influenced by solvation effects, where weaker bases and larger nucleophiles are often more reactive due to less solvation.

### Analysis of the Nucleophiles:
1. **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)**: Thiols are generally better nucleophiles than alcohols in polar protic solvents because sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, making HS⁻ larger and less solvated. This makes it the most reactive nucleophile in water.
   
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: OH⁻ is a strong base but highly solvated in aqueous solution, making it less reactive than HS⁻. However, it is more reactive than the other nucleophiles listed.

3. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: This is a strong base due to its alkoxide nature, but steric hindrance from the 4-methyl group and strong solvation in water reduce its nucleophilicity. It is less reactive than OH⁻ but more reactive than propionate.

4. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: Propionate is a weaker base compared to the other nucleophiles and is less reactive due to its relatively strong solvation in water. It is more reactive than methanol but less reactive than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate.

5. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: Methanol is a neutral molecule and the weakest nucleophile in this list. Neutral species are generally poor nucleophiles in polar protic solvents.

### Nucleophilicity Order:
Based on the above analysis, the nucleophilicity order in aqueous solution is:
**Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) > Hydroxide (OH⁻) > 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate > Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻) > Methanol (CH₃OH).**

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (5, 2, 3, 1, 4)**: Incorrect, as propionate (3) is less reactive than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1).
- **Option B (2, 5, 1, 4, 3)**: Incorrect, as hydroxide (2) is less reactive than ethanethiolate (5).
- **Option C (2, 5, 3, 4, 3)**: Invalid, as it repeats propionate (3).
- **Option D (5, 2, 1, 3, 4)**: Correct, matches the determined order.

ANSWER: D
