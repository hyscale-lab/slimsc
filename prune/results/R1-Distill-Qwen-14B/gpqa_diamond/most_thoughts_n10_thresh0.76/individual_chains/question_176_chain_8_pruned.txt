Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to make sense of it. The question is about measuring observables P and Q in a system. Right, I remember that when you measure an observable, you get one of its eigenvalues, and the probability is related to the state's projection onto the corresponding eigenspace.

Let me read the question again. The state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, so that's a 3x1 vector? Oh wait, no, wait, the state is a vector in 3-dimensional space. So it's a column vector like [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized. Oh, right, so I need to check if this state is normalized. Let me calculate the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector should be (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by that column. Because in quantum mechanics, states are represented as unit vectors.

So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T. Let's denote this as |ψ>.

Now, the operators P and Q are given as matrices. So P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write down P:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm, looks like P has some symmetry. And Q is another matrix:

First row: 1, 0, 0.
Second row: 0, 0, 0.
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

Wait, that's a diagonal matrix. So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. Because the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So measuring Q will give 1, 0, or -1.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P. Wait, no—wait, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the order is first measure P, then measure Q.
