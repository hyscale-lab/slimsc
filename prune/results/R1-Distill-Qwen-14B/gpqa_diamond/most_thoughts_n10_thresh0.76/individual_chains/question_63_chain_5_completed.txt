Okay, so I have this physics problem here about molecules and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the fundamental state—oh right, that's the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state. But when a photon is absorbed, it moves to the next state. I guess that next state would be the first excited state. But what's the next state with the lowest energy? I think it depends on whether it's a rotation or vibration transition. Since the model is rotation-vibration, maybe it's a combination of both.

Wait, the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, right, in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so vibration comes into play. So this model probably combines rotational and vibrational energy levels.

But the question is about absorbing a photon to switch to the next state. So what's the next state? The ground state is the lowest energy, so the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either a higher rotational state or a vibrational state. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, transitions can involve either changing the vibrational state or the rotational state, or both.

Wait, I think the question is specifically about the fundamental state. The fundamental state in molecular vibrations is the lowest energy vibrational state, which is n=0. So the next vibrational state would be n=1. But if the molecule is in the ground state, maybe it's already in the lowest vibrational and rotational states.

Wait no, the ground state in the rotation-vibration model is a combination of the lowest rotational and vibrational states. So the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). To get the next state, perhaps we need a photon that provides the energy to either change the vibrational state or the rotational state.

But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible increase in energy. That would be the smallest possible energy difference. So which transition gives the smaller energy difference: vibration or rotation?

Hmm, vibrational transitions typically require more energy because the vibrational energy levels are spaced more closely, but wait, no, wait. Actually, the energy spacing between vibrational levels is larger than rotational levels. Because the vibrational energy levels are given by (n + 1/2)hw, so each transition is hw. Rotational transitions are about (J+1)w_rot, but the spacing between rotational levels is smaller. So perhaps the smallest energy change comes from a rotational transition.

Wait no, let me think again. The energy spacing for rotation is lower than for vibration. Because the rotational energy is (J)(J+1)ħ²/(2I), so each step in J increases the energy by about 2B, where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, each step is h bar w, which is higher than B for typical molecules. So for the next state, the minimal energy photon would correspond to a rotational transition.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which includes both the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0, I think). So to go to the next state, the molecule can either increase J or increase n.

But which requires less energy? Let me calculate the energy difference for each.

So the vibrational energy difference from n=0 to n=1 is h*w, where w is the angular frequency given as 4e14 rad/s.

The rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1: The energy for rotation is E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which depends on the moment of inertia.

Wait, but B is ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ r², with μ being the reduced mass.

So I think the rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot = B(1*(1+1) - 0) )= 2B.

So the question is, which is smaller: h*w or 2B?

Because if 2B is smaller than h*w, then the photon needed would be 2B. Otherwise, it's h*w.

So I need to compute both and compare.

Let me compute h*w first.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

h*w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now compute 2B.

B is the rotational constant, which is ħ^2/(2I).

But wait, I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r².

μ is the reduced mass: μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Given Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate.

1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3 (since 1.8*1.66 is around 2.988). So approximately 2.988e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, maybe more accurately:

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

1.8 * 1.6605 is 2.9889. 0.018 * 1.6605 is about 0.029889. So total is approx 3.0188e-27 kg.

So I = μ r².

r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m.

So r² = (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

Then I = μ * r² = (3.0188e-27 kg) * 4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg·m².

Now B = ħ²/(2I).

What's ħ? It's h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² ≈ (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ approx 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2075e-46) ) = (1.112e-68) / (2.415e-46) ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Wait wait, but that can't be right. Because h*w is about 2.65e-19 J, which is bigger than 9.2e-23 J. So 2B is much smaller than h*w. So the energy difference for a rotational transition (like from J=0 to J=1) is 2B, which is about 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the photon's energy is E_photon = h*f = p*c, but wait, p is the momentum. Alternatively, E = pc for photons, assuming they're massless (which they are, so E = pc). So if I find the energy needed, then p = E / c.

So for the rotational transition, the energy needed is 2B = 9.2e-23 J. Then the momentum p = E/c.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because I might have made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me re-calculate B.

μ is (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605:

Calculate 1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889.

0.018 *1.6605 = 0.029889.

So total is 2.9889 +0.029889= 3.0188. So 3.0188e-27 kg.

r is 2e-10 m. So I = μ r² = (3.0188e-27) * (4e-20) = 1.2075e-46 kg·m².

Now ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2075e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 ≈ (1.112/2.415) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.415 is about 0.46.

So B ≈ 0.46e-22 J = 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

h*w was 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger than 9.2e-23 J. So the photon needed for the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

So the molecule can absorb a photon with energy 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J, and that would cause it to transition from J=0 to J=1, which is the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So it's looking for the smallest possible photon energy.

Wait, but in the case of the molecule being in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), the next state could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. Which has the lower energy difference? J=1 requires 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J, and n=1 requires h*w= 2.65e-19 J. So the J=1 transition is much lower in energy.

So the photon needs to have energy equal to 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Since photons have E = pc, so p = E/c.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are around 1e-27 to 1e-28. My calculated p is 3e-31, which is way smaller than any of the options. Hmm, so that suggests I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I got the model wrong. The question says the non-rigid rotor model, which probably includes both rotation and vibration. So the states are quantized in both, and the transitions can involve changes in both.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is the lowest combination of vibrational and rotational energy. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can increase either vibrational, rotational, or both. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon must be the one that causes the smallest possible increase in energy.

Wait, but wait, what is the energy of the photon? The energy would correspond to the difference between the current state and the next state. So if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0), the next state could be J=1 or n=1.

Which requires less energy? As before, 2B is much less than h*w. So the photon required would be 2B, but when I calculated that, the momentum was way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe the question is not considering the rotational transition but the vibrational? But that would require higher energy, which doesn't fit the "lowest possible energy" part.

Alternatively, perhaps the model considers the combination of rotation and vibration, so the energy levels are a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition not just within the same vibrational state but to a higher state, but it's the first possible transition in energy order. So perhaps the first possible transition is from (n=0, J=0) to (n=0, J=1), which requires 2B.

But earlier calculation gave p ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s, but the options are on the order of 1e-27. Hmm, that's four orders of magnitude higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of B?

Wait, let's re-calculate B.

I think I might have messed up the calculation of B.

Wait, B is the rotational constant, given by B = ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, here's another approach. Let me compute the reduced mass μ correctly.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = ?

Let me calculate 1.818 *1.6605 = 1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889, 0.018 *1.6605≈0.029889. So total ≈3.0188. So μ ≈3.0188e-27 kg.

Wait, no, wait. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.818 *1.6605 = ?

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889.

0.018 *1.6605=0.029889.

So sum is 2.9889 + 0.029889 = 3.018789.

So μ is approximately 3.0188e-27 kg.

Then I = μ r².

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So r squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

I = μ * r² = 3.0188e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.112e-68) / (2 *1.2075e-46) )= 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, yes, same as before. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J, and pc = E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

p = E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way larger. Oh wait, perhaps I made an error in the model.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is considering a transition that changes both vibrational and rotational states, to the next state. But that would require finding the difference between (n=0, J=0) and (n=1, J=0), or (n=0, J=1), whichever is lower.

Wait the energy of the state is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

E_vibrational is (n + 1/2) h w.

E_rotational is B J (J+1).

So the ground state is (n=0, J=0): E = (0.5) h w + 0.

The first excited state could be either (n=1, J=0) or (n=0, J=1).

Compute the energies.

E1 for (n=1, J=0): (1.5) h w + 0 = 1.5 *2.65e-19 J ≈3.975e-19 J.

E2 for (n=0, J=1): (0.5) h w + 2B = 1.325e-19 + 9.2e-23 ≈1.325e-19 J.

Comparing E1 and E2, E2 is smaller, so the next state is (n=0, J=1), requiring energy 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, so p = E/c = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options, none are anywhere near that. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg·m/s.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Oh! Oh wait, did I confuse photon energy with something else?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Momentum p of a photon is related to frequency ν by p = h ν / (2π c) ?

No, wait, p = E/c. Because for photons, E = h ν = pc. So p = E/c.

Wait, but earlier calculation was correct. So if E is 9.2e-23 J, p is 3.06e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are about 1e-27, which is about three orders of magnitude larger. So perhaps I messed up the exponent in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of B.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, I = μ r².

μ is approx 3.0188e-27 kg.

r is 2e-10 m. So r squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So I =3.0188e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2075e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2075e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46.

Wait, 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22, but 2.415 is 2.415e0.

So 1.112 /2.415 is approximately 0.46.

So 0.46e-22 J =4.6e-23 J.

Oh wait, that's correct.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

So p = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.06e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way larger. Did I perhaps confuse B with another constant?

Wait, maybe I should be using the rotational energy levels differently.

Wait, another formula for rotational energy is E = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2I).

Wait, I think in the non-rigid rotor model, the moment of inertia I is a function of the vibrational state, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the model uses the rigid rotor approximation, but the question says non-rigid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, but the minimal energy transition is a combination.

Wait, another approach: what is the energy difference between the (n=0, J=0) state and the (n=1, J=0) state. That's the vibrational transition, which has energy hw=2.65e-19 J.

Alternatively, the difference between (n=0, J=0) and (n=0, J=1) is 2B=9.2e-23 J.

So the photon needed is 2B if that's the lower energy transition. Which it is.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p = 3.06e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are all in the order of 1e-27, which is about three orders higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent calculation.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Let's recompute B.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, I is μ r².

Wait, μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) in amu, but when converted to kg, it's (Mx [kg] * My [kg])/(Mx + My [kg]).

Wait, Mx is 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.321e-26 kg.

My is 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2 amu is 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg. So Mx is 20 *1.6605e-27=3.321e-26 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 kg) * (3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27) kg.

Wait, wait, that's the formula. Sorry, μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

Wait, Mx and My are in kg. So let me calculate:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 *1.6605e-27 =3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

So Mx + My = 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

Mx * My = 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2e-53 = approx 11.0e-53 = 1.1e-52 kg².

So μ = (1.1e-52 kg²) / (3.6531e-26 kg) )= approx 3.01e-27 kg.

Which matches what I computed earlier. So I remains 1.2075e-46 kg·m².

So B remains 4.6e-23 J.

Hmm, I'm not seeing the mistake here. So why the discrepancy with the options?

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the energy difference for the vibration, not rotation. Because if I take the energy as h*w, which is 2.65e-19 J, then the momentum would be 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈8.8e-30 kg·m/s.

Still way smaller than the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state, which might be n=0, J=1 and n=1, J=0, but that's not right. Or perhaps it's a different model.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the momentum using the photon's energy as the sum of both rotational and vibrational contributions. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm, all are about 1e-27 or 1e-28. My calculation was 3e-31, which is about 3e-4 times smaller than option A (1.9e-28). So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent by a factor of 1e4, which would be four orders of magnitude.

Wait, where could I have gone wrong by a factor of 1e4? Let me check the value of ħ.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Did I use that correctly?

Yes, in the calculation of ħ², which is (1.05e-34)^2 = 1.1e-68 (J·s)^2.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=1), which would involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But that would require energy h*w + 2B, which is way larger than either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a different transition, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I confused the vibrational and rotational energy expressions. Let me recheck.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I).

But wait, sometimes B is expressed as (h²)/(8 π² I), which is the same as ħ²/(2I) because ħ= h/(2π), so ħ² = h²/(4 π²).

So (h²/(8 π² I)) ) equals ( (h^2/(4 π² I)) ) * (1/2) ), which is ħ²/(2I)* 1/2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B differently.

Wait, another formula for the rotational constant B is B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), but that's when using cm^-1 as the unit. Wait, no, that's another approach. Alternatively, B is often given in wavenumbers, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the angular frequency of rotation, which is different from the vibration frequency. Oh wait, the problem gives the angular frequency of vibration, w =4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but the rotational energy depends on the rotational angular frequency, which is related to B. Because B is ħ²/(2I), and the rotational angular frequency is sqrt(2I/( ħ² )) * something. Wait, the rotational energy is E_rot = (J (J+1)) (ħ²/(2I)) ), which is J (J+1) B.

So B is E_rot per J(J+1).

Wait, perhaps I'm correct in the earlier calculation. So I think the problem is that the answer I'm getting doesn't match the options, and I'm not seeing where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg, so 1.818 amu is 1.818 *1.66e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05e-34)^2/(2*1.207e-46) = (1.1e-68)/(2.414e-46) ≈ 4.55e-23 J.

So 2B =9.1e-23 J.

Photon energy E_photon =9.1e-23 J.

So p = E/c =9.1e-23 /3e8 = 3.03e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps the question is about a photon that causes a transition in the vibrational energy, not the rotational. Because earlier, I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute the photon momentum if it's the vibrational transition.

E_photon = h*w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈8.83e-30 kg·m/s.

Again, way smaller than the options.

Hmm, this is perplexing. All possibilities lead to p being on the order of 1e-30, but the options are on the order of 1e-27.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the model. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is (n=0, J=0), perhaps. To go to the next state, it could be (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0). But perhaps the model combines both, and the next state requires a photon that provides both a vibrational and rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the energy of a photon that could cause a transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which could be a combination of vibrational and rotational.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is the sum of the vibrational and rotational contributions. No, that would be higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rigid rotor model, which considers the moment of inertia as fixed, but then why is it called non-rigid?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the quantum model but about a classical model, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the transition as vibrational, but I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy difference is (n=0, J=0) to (n=0, J=1), which is 2B.

But the momentum required is p= h ν /c?

Wait, E = h ν → ν= E/h.

So ν = (2B)/h = (9.2e-23 J) / (6.626e-34 J·s) ≈1.39e11 Hz.

p = h ν / c = (6.626e-34) * (1.39e11) / (3e8) = (9.22e-23) /3e8 ≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Same as before.

But options are way larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the photon's momentum but its energy in some other units, but no, the options are in N·s, which is kg·m/s.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state, which requires a photon with energy h*w. Which would be 2.65e-19 J, leading to p=8.83e-30 kg·m/s.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating 2B. Let's recompute B.

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg·m².

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68.

B = ħ²/(2I) =1.112e-68/(2 *1.207e-46) = 1.112e-68 /2.414e-46 ≈4.6e-23 J.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is actually referring to the transition from (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=1), which would be a combination of both energy changes.

So the energy difference would be (n=1: 1.5 h w) + (J=1: 2B) ) - (n=0, J=0).

Wait, but that would be 1.5 h w + 2B.

Which is 1.5 *2.65e-19 +9.2e-23 ≈ 3.975e-19 + 9.2e-23 ≈3.975e-19 J.

p =3.975e-19 /3e8 =1.325e-30 kg·m/s.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe it's a transition to (n=1, J=0), which is purely vibrational, E=1.5 h w=3.975e-19 J.

p=3.975e-19/3e8=1.325e-30 kg·m/s.

No match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B again.

B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

I =1.207e-46 kg·m².

So B=1.112e-68 / (2 *1.207e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the unit conversion for the bond length. The bond length is 2 angstroms. Wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m. So r² is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m². Correct.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

All about 1e-27 or 1e-28.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1e3 in the calculation. Let me see.

Wait, in the calculation of B, perhaps I forgot that the moment of inertia is in kg·m² and the other terms are in their units. But I don't think so. Because all the units are in SI units.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the photon's energy but about the change in the molecule's linear momentum due to the photon's impact. But no, the question asks for the photon's momentum.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition not in the ground state but the first excited state. Wait, no, the molecule is in the fundamental state.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is considering the Raman transition, which involves simultaneous changes in both vibrational and rotational states, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the (n=0, J=0) state to the (n=1, J=0) state, which requires a photon with energy hw. So E=2.65e-19 J.

Then p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-30 kg·m/s. Still doesn't match any option.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=0 to J=1 (rotational), and the photon's momentum is being calculated using the formula p = m v, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong reduced mass.

Wait, the reduced mass for a diatomic molecule is μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My).

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) =40/22≈1.818 amu, which is 3.018e-27 kg.

Correct.

Hmm, I'm not seeing where I could have gone wrong. Perhaps the correct approach is to choose the option that is 2B/c, but since my calculation doesn't match, perhaps I should calculate the given options to see which one aligns with the computed B.

Wait, 2B =9.2e-23 J. So p =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

None of the options are close. So perhaps the problem is considering a different model, such as treating the molecule as a simple harmonic oscillator, where the energy levels are (n + 1/2) h w, and the next state is n=1, so the photon's energy is h w, which gives p=8.83e-30 kg·m/s.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next rotational state, but using a different formula for B. Let me compute B using w_rot, the rotational angular frequency, which is sqrt( (k)/μ ), where k is the force constant. But I don't have k. Alternatively, B is related to w_rot by w_rot = sqrt(2 I B ). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, w_rot is given by w_rot = sqrt( (k)/(μ r²) ), but without k, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the rotational angular frequency can be calculated from the given bond length and reduced mass. The formula for rotational angular frequency is w_rot = sqrt( (k)/(μ r²) ), but without k, I can't proceed. But wait, perhaps using the vibrational w, but no, they're different.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational constant B is related to the vibrational frequency. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is mixing up rotational and vibrational energies, and the next state is (n=0, J=1), requiring 2B.

But without matching the options, perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state, which is (n=1, J=0), which requires h*w, giving p=8.83e-30 N·s. But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor, but I don't see how that would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the correct formula for B.

Wait, another formula for B is B = (h c )/(4 π² c I), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy formula E_rot = J (J+1) B, where B is given in cm^-1, but that would require converting units, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of the given data. Let me think differently.

Wait, I'm given the angular frequency of vibration, w =4e14 rad/s. But I don't think that's directly related to B, unless through some other relation.

Wait, perhaps the vibrational and rotational energies are treated as separate, and the next state is the first excited state of vibration, which requires a photon with E=h*w. So p= h w /c= (6.626e-34 *4e14)/3e8 =8.83e-30 kg·m/s.

Again, not matching any option.

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer isn't among the options, but since I have to choose, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

I = μ r² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg·m².

ħ=1.05457e-34 J·s.

B= ħ²/(2 I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2*1.207e-46) = (1.112e-68)/(2.414e-46) ≈4.6e-23 J.

So 2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's model.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition from (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=1), but that would require a photon with energy h w + 2B, which is even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=0 to J=1, which is 2B, but the options are too small.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually considering the change in the rotational state but using the linear momentum equation p = m v r. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since my calculations don't match the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the question is about the molecule transitioning to the next vibrational state, so E = h w.

So p= h w /c= (6.626e-34 *4e14)/3e8 = (2.65e-19)/3e8=8.83e-30 kg·m/s.

But that's still not matching any options. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest is option C) 1.1e-27, which is about 1e-27. But my calculation is 8.8e-30, which is about 8e-30, an order of magnitude smaller.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of h*w. Let me recheck:

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Correct.

So p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-30 kg·m/s.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the rotational transition, which gives p=3e-31 kg·m/s, but that's not in the options either.

Hmm. I must be missing something here. Let's check the options again.

Wait, option B is 2.3e-27 N·s.

Wait, 2.3e-27 kg·m/s.

If E_photon is h w =2.65e-19 J, then p=8.83e-30 kg·m/s =8.83e-30 N·s. That's about 8.8e-30, which is 0.88e-29, nowhere near the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rotational energy transition of 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J, giving p=3.07e-31 kg·m/s =3.07e-31 N·s. Also not matching.

Another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first excited vibrational state (n=1) and the first excited rotational state (J=1), but the energy would be the sum of both, which is even higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum in the molecule's rest frame, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the correct formula for the energy levels.

Wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model includes the vibration-rotation coupling, and the energy levels are more complex. But without knowing the exact formula, it's hard to proceed.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the correct approach is to select the option that corresponds to the rotational transition, which is 2B, but given that, the momentum is 3e-31, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but since I have to choose, I'll go back to the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation leads to option C. Let's see.

If option C is 1.1e-27 kg·m/s, then E_photon = p*c =1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J.

Which is about 3.3e-19 J.

What's 3.3e-19 J in terms of h*w?

h*w=2.65e-19 J. So 3.3e-19 is about 1.25 times h*w.

So that would imply n increases by 1.25, which doesn't make sense for quantized states. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rotational B to find p.

If p=1.1e-27 kg·m/s, then E=pc=3.3e-19 J.

Which would be 3.3e-19 / (4e14) =8.25e-5 J·s/rad. Not sure.

Alternatively, 3.3e-19 J = 2B → B=1.65e-19 J.

But earlier calculation of B was 4.6e-23 J, which is much smaller.

So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but I have to choose the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, another way to compute B is using B = (h²)/(8 π² I).

Wait, let's try that.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

8 π² I =8*(9.8696)*(1.207e-46) =8*9.87*1.207e-46 ≈8 *11.905e-46 ≈9.524e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.524e-45 ≈4.6e-23 J. Same as before.

So that doesn't change anything.

Alright, perhaps I should proceed to choose the option that corresponds to the rotational transition, which is the smallest energy difference. Therefore, the correct answer is 2B/c, which is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question intended to use the vibrational transition.

But even that doesn't match. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: 1.1e-27, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting angstroms. Oh! Wait, 2 angstroms is 0.2 nanometers. But wait, perhaps I should have used bond length in meters correctly. Wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B using the formula for the rotational energy levels in terms of the vibrational frequency, but I don't see a direct relation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the first overtone, which would be 2hw. But that's even higher.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. I think the correct approach is to go with the rotational transition, which would give p=3.07e-31 kg·m/s, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess that the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 N·s, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Key Parameters and Energy Transitions**:  
   - The molecule's reduced mass, $\mu$, is calculated as:  
     $$\mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.$$  
   - The moment of inertia, $I$, is given by:  
     $$I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.$$  
   - The rotational constant, $B$, is calculated as:  
     $$B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.$$  
   - The energy difference for a rotational transition from $J=0$ to $J=1$ is:  
     $$\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.$$  
   - The energy difference for a vibrational transition from $n=0$ to $n=1$ is:  
     $$\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.$$

2. **Comparison of Energy Gaps**:  
   The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition:  
   $$\Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \ll \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.$$  
   Therefore, the photon required for the next state with the lowest energy corresponds to the rotational transition.

3. **Photon Momentum Calculation**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:  
   $$p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}.$$  
   This value is orders of magnitude smaller than any of the provided options, which are on the order of $10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s}$.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   The calculated momentum for the rotational transition does not match any of the given options. However, the vibrational transition corresponds to:  
   $$p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{kg·m/s},$$  
   which is also much smaller than the options. Despite extensive recalculations and consideration of alternative interpretations, none of the options align with the derived values.

5. **Final Choice**:  
   Given the discrepancy between the calculated values and the provided options, and assuming the problem intends for the vibrational transition to be considered, the closest option is **C) $1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s}$**.

Answer: C
