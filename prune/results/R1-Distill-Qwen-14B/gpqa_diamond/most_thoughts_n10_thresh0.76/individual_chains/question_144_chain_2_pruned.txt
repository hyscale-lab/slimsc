Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that particles like mesons are bosons, made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are particles that are not stable and decay quickly. So the mean decay distance would relate to how far they travel before decaying.

The given data are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Wait, the units are a mix of GeV and MeV. Oh right, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 8 GeV is 8000 MeV. But maybe I don't need to convert units right away.

I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime. The formula probably involves the lifetime and the speed of the particle. Oh, right! The mean decay distance (L) is given by L = v * τ, where v is the velocity and τ is the mean lifetime.

But how do I find τ? I remember that the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy (Γ) and the uncertainty in time (τ) are related by Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Or wait, actually, I think the exact relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime.

Wait, units again. ħ (h-bar) is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, I can compute τ in seconds.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV. Let me convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check: 6.582e-25 /0.32 is indeed about 2.056e-24 s.

Now, I need the velocity v. How do I find that? The particle has a certain energy E, and mass m. The energy is given as 8 GeV, mass is 1.2 GeV. So E is way larger than m, so the particle is ultra-relativistic. Hmm, but even so, let's calculate it properly.

The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². I can solve for p to find the momentum, then find v from p = γ m v.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the relation for velocity in terms of energy and mass. Let's see.

The total energy E = gamma * m c².

The momentum p = gamma * m v.

But another approach is to use beta = v/c = (p c) /
