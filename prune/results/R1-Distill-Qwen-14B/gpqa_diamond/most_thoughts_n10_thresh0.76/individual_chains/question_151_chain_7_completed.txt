Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about finding the probability of measuring a particular observable, P, and getting a specific outcome, which is 0.

Alright, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a 3x1 vector. I think that's the state vector, probably denoted as |ψ⟩. So the vector ψ is [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? Do I need to normalize this first?

Let me check. The components are -1, 2, 1. The sum of the squares of the absolute values is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. So to get the actual state, I should divide each component by sqrt(6). So ψ would be [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Wait, but maybe the problem says the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), so perhaps it's not normalized. But in quantum mechanics, observables are measured using projectors based on their eigenstates. So perhaps I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of P to proceed.

The operator P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P looks like this:

Row 1: 0  1/√2  0
Row 2: 1/√2  0  1/√2
Row 3: 0  1/√2  0

Hmm, I need to find the eigenvalues of P because the possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues. The question specifically asks for the probability of getting 0 as a result.

So, step 1: find the eigenvalues of matrix P.

Eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me write down the matrix (P - λ I):

[ -λ     1/√2      0      ]
[1/√2   -λ       1/√2    ]
[ 0     1/√2    -λ      ]

Calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using expansion by minors or other methods.

Alternatively, maybe P has some symmetry that can be exploited. Looking at P, the matrix seems to have a particular structure. Let me think: perhaps it's a circulant matrix? Or maybe it's a symmetric matrix. Wait, P is symmetric because the (i,j) element equals the (j,i) element. For instance, P[0][1] = P[1][0] = 1/sqrt(2). So yes, it's a symmetric matrix, which implies that it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Since P is a 3x3 matrix, it will have three eigenvalues. Let me denote them as λ1, λ2, λ3.

Another approach: perhaps P can be written as a combination of other matrices. Let me see.

Wait, P looks similar to a graph Laplacian matrix. Alternatively, maybe it's a matrix representing a spin-1 system or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a projection operator, but probably not. Let me think about the trace and other properties.

The trace of P is the sum of the diagonal elements: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is 0. That's useful.

The determinant of P is the product of its eigenvalues. Let me compute the determinant to get more information.

Compute determinant of P:

P is:

0   1/√2  0
1/√2  0   1/√2
0   1/√2  0

Calculating determinant:

Using the rule for 3x3 matrices:

= 0*(0*0 - 1/√2 *1/√2) - (1/√2)*(1/√2 *0 - 1/√2 *0) + 0*(1/√2 *1/√2 - 0*0)
Wait, that might be a bit messy, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding along the first row.

det(P) = 0 * minor(0,0) - (1/√2) * minor(0,1) + 0 * minor(0,2)

So minor(0,1) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column 1:

Which is:
Row 1: 1/√2  1/√2
Row 2: 0      0

Wait no, more accurately, the minor for element (0,1) is:

Rows 1 and 2, columns 0 and 2.

So the minor matrix is:

1/√2   1/√2
0       0

The determinant of that is (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 0) = 0.

So the determinant is 0 * something - (1/√2)*0 + 0 * something = 0.

So determinant is zero. Therefore, the product of the eigenvalues is zero. So one of the eigenvalues must be zero.

Which implies that 0 is an eigenvalue. So the possible outcomes include 0.

Now, the other eigenvalues must satisfy sum(λ_i) = 0, because the trace is zero. So λ1 + λ2 + λ3 = 0.

And λ1 * λ2 * λ3 = 0, so one of them is zero.

Suppose λ3 = 0. Then λ1 + λ2 = 0. So λ2 = -λ1.

So the product would be λ1 * (-λ1) * 0 = 0.

But how to find the other eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps P has rank 2, since the determinant is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvectors by inspection.

Looking for eigenvectors of P. Let me consider the case where λ=0.

We can solve (P - 0 I) x = 0 → P x = 0.

So P x = 0.

The matrix P is:

0   1/√2  0
1/√2  0   1/√2
0   1/√2  0

So the system is:

1. 0*x1 + (1/√2) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 → x2 = 0
2. (1/√2) x1 + 0 x2 + (1/√2) x3 = 0 → x1 + x3 = 0
3. 0 x1 + (1/√2) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 → x2 = 0

So from equation 1 and 3, x2 = 0.

From equation 2, x1 + x3 = 0 → x3 = -x1.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where x2=0 and x3 = -x1.

Let x1 = a, x2=0, x3 = -a.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 0, -1)^T. So one such eigenvector is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2), but wait, normalization isn't necessary for eigenvectors. So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1)^T.

Wait, but P is a 3x3 matrix, so it should have 3 eigenvectors, possibly with multiplicities.

But let's proceed. So for the eigenvalue 0, the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). So that's one eigenstate.

The other eigenvalues can be found by considering that the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So the other two eigenvalues must sum to zero, λ and -λ.

So the other eigenstates might be symmetric in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps P can be written as a matrix with eigenvalues 1, -1, and 0. Wait, let me check.

Wait, let me compute P squared. Maybe that can give some insight.

Compute P^2.

P is:

Row 0: 0 1/√2 0

Row 1: 1/√2 0 1/√2

Row 2: 0 1/√2 0

So P^2 = P multiplied by P.

Let me compute each element:

Element (0,0): (0)(0) + (1/√2)(1/√2) + (0)(0) = (1/2) [since (1/√2)^2 is 1/2]

Element (0,1): (0)(1/√2) + (1/√2)(0) + (0)(1/√2) = 0.

Element (0,2): (0)(0) + (1/√2)(1/√2) + (0)(0) = 1/2.

Similarly, row 0: [1/2, 0, 1/2 ]

Row 1:

Element (1,0):

(1/√2)(0) + (0)(1/√2) + (1/√2)(0) = 0.

Element (1,1):

(1/√2)(1/√2) + (0)(0) + (1/√2)(1/√2) = (1/2) + (1/2) = 1.

Element (1,2):

(1/√2)(0) + (0)(1/√2) + (1/√2)(0) = 0.

So row 1: [0, 1, 0 ]

Row 2:

Element (2,0):

(0)(0) + (1/√2)(1/√2) + (0)(0) = 1/2.

Element (2,1): (0)(1/√2) + (1/√2)(0) + (0)(1/√2) = 0.

Element (2,2): (0)(0) + (1/√2)(1/√2) + (0)(0) = 1/2.

So row 2: [1/2, 0, 1/2 ]

So P^2 is:

[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1/2, 0, 1/2 ] ]

Hmm, interesting. Now, what about P cubed? Maybe it's a pattern, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps P^2 can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix and P.

Wait, can we compute P^2 + something?

Alternatively, perhaps P is idempotent, but idempotent matrices satisfy P^2=P, which doesn't look like the case here.

Wait, let me compute P^2 again.

Wait I think I made a mistake in computing P^2. Let me re-do the calculation.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of P as a sum of permutation matrices scaled by 1/sqrt(2) and 1.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues.

Assume that λ is an eigenvalue of P with eigenvector [x, y, z]^T.

So P [x, y, z]^T = λ [x, y, z]^T.

Which gives the system:

(1) (1/√2) y = λ x

(2) (1/√2) x + (1/√2) z = λ y

(3) (1/√2) y = λ z

So from equation (1) and (3), we get:

y = λ sqrt(2) x

and

z = y / (λ sqrt(2)) ) )

Wait, equation (1): (1/√2) y = λ x → y = λ x * sqrt(2)

Similarly, equation (3): (1/√2) y = λ z → y = λ z * sqrt(2) → z = y/(λ sqrt(2)).

But from equation (1), y = λ x sqrt(2), so substituting into equation (3), z = (λ x sqrt(2)) / (λ sqrt(2)) ) = x.

So z = x.

Now, substitute into equation (2):

(1/√2) x + (1/√2) z = λ y

But z = x, so left side becomes (1/√2)(x + x) )= (2x)/√2 = x sqrt(2).

And y = λ x sqrt(2).

So equation (2) becomes: x sqrt(2) = λ (λ x sqrt(2) )

Divide both sides by x (assuming x≠0, which it must be for a non-zero eigenvector), we get:

sqrt(2) = λ^2 sqrt(2)

Divide both sides by sqrt(2):

1 = λ^2 → λ = 1 or λ = -1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Because the trace is zero, and the three eigenvalues sum to zero.

So the eigenvalues of P are -1, 0, and 1.

So the observable P can take values -1, 0, or 1.

The problem asks for the probability of measuring 0.

In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (here, 0) is given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.

But first, I need to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

We already considered λ=0 earlier and found the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is v0 = [1, 0, -1]^T (or any scalar multiple).

Now, for λ=1 and λ=-1, let's find their eigenvectors.

Starting with λ=1:

From equations (1): (1/√2)y = (1)x → y = sqrt(2) x.

From equation (3): (1/√2)y = (1) z → z = y/(sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2) x) / sqrt(2) )= x.

So z = x.

Substitute into equation (2):

(1/√2)x + (1/√2) z = (1) y.

But z = x, so (1/√2)(x + x) = (1) y.

→ (2x)/√2 = y.

But y is sqrt(2) x, so (2x)/√2 = sqrt(2) x.

Compute (2/√2) = sqrt(2) → 2/(√2) = sqrt(2) → because sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) =2, so sqrt(2) = 2/(sqrt(2)).

Yes, indeed, 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). So this holds.

So the eigenvector for λ=1 is [x, sqrt(2)x, x]^T.

To make it a unit vector, we can set x=1/sqrt(2), so the vector becomes (1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2))^T.

Wait, why 1/sqrt(2) ? Let me compute the normalization.

The vector is [x, sqrt(2) x, x]^T.

The squared norm is x² + (sqrt(2)x)^2 + x² = x² + 2x² + x² =4x².

So to have norm 1, x² = 1/4 → x=1/2.

Wait wait, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, [x, sqrt(2) x, x]^T

The norm squared is x^2 + (sqrt(2)x)^2 + x^2 = x² + 2 x² + x² =4 x².

So to make it 1, 4x²=1 → x=1/2.

So the normalized eigenvector is [1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2]^T.

Wait, but wait: sqrt(2)/2 is 1/sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector for λ=1 is (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2).

Wait, but 1/2 is 0.5, and 1/sqrt(2) is about 0.707.

Wait, let me compute the components.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write it as (1, sqrt(2), 1)^T, but normalized.

Because [1, sqrt(2), 1] → norm squared is 1^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 +1^2 =1 + 2 +1=4. So norm is 2. So the unit vector is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2)^T.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, for λ=-1:

From equations (1) and (3):

y = (-1) x sqrt(2).

z = y / ( (-1) sqrt(2) ) → z = [ (-1) x sqrt(2) ] / ( (-1) sqrt(2) ) ) → z = x.

So z = x.

Substitute into equation (2):

(1/√2)x + (1/√2) z = (-1) y.

But z=x, so (1/√2)(x + x) = (-1) y.

Left side: (2x)/√2 = x sqrt(2).

Right side: (-1) y = (-1)(-sqrt(2) x) )= sqrt(2) x.

So equation (2) becomes x sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) x → which holds.

So the eigenvector for λ=-1 is [x, -sqrt(2) x, x]^T.

Normalization: same as before, x=1/2.

So the normalized eigenvectors are:

v0 = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2) → because the norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) )= sqrt(2). So v0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

v1 = (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2)^T.

v-1 = (1/2, -1/sqrt(2), 1/2)^T.

Wait, let me check the norm for v1:

( (1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/sqrt(2))^2 ) + ( (1/2)^2 ) = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4=1. So yes, it's normalized.

Similarly for v-1.

So now, the state vector is given as ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

But wait, the state vectors in quantum mechanics are typically normalized. So ψ should have a norm of 1. Let's compute the norm of the given vector:

|ψ| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1 +4 +1 )= sqrt(6).

So the normalized state is ψ_normalized = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the v0 component in ψ.

Wait, but wait: in quantum mechanics, the probability is the inner product of ψ with the eigenvector, squared.

So the amplitude is the inner product of ψ and v0.

So compute <v0 | ψ>.

Wait, no: in Dirac notation, the probability is |<v0 | ψ>|^2.

So v0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

ψ is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Compute each term:

First term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) )= -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= -1/(sqrt(12)) )= -1/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )= -1/(sqrt(12)) )= -1/(2*sqrt(3)).

So adding the first and third terms: (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) + (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) )= -2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The middle term is zero.

So the inner product is -1/sqrt(3).

The square of the absolute value is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \) for the given state vector. Here's the analysis:

---

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The state vector is given as \( \psi = [-1, 2, 1]^T \). The norm is calculated as:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state vector is:

\[
\psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After analyzing the matrix, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = -1, 0, 1 \).

---

### Step 3: Find the eigenvectors of \( P \)
For each eigenvalue, the corresponding eigenvectors are determined:

1. **For \( \lambda = 0 \):**
   The eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing it gives:
   \[
   v_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **For \( \lambda = 1 \):**
   The eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing it gives:
   \[
   v_1 = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **For \( \lambda = -1 \):**
   The eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -\sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing it gives:
   \[
   v_{-1} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -\sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

---

### Step 4: Compute the probability of measuring \( 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of the \( v_0 \) component in the normalized state vector \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} \). The amplitude is the inner product:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Compute the dot product:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left[ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left[ -1 - 1 \right] = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value:

\[
P(0) = \left| \langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

**Answer: C**
