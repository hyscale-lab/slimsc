Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it involves a dicarboxylic acid, dehydration to an anhydride, and then a reaction with a cyclopentadiene. The products are two, major and minor, both with the same molecular formula. The question is about the NOESY NMR spectra, specifically which resonances are connected by a cross-peak in the major product.

Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has an NMR: in 1H, a single peak at 7 ppm. That makes me think of something with equivalent protons, maybe in a symmetric environment. The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Wait, what carbons are those? 165 is probably an ester or carbonyl carbon. The 137 ppm is likely a carbon attached to protons, maybe something like a double bond or an oxygenated carbon.

Wait, anhydrides have two carbonyl groups. But the 13C has only two peaks. Oh, wait, maybe the structure is symmetric. Like if the two carbonyls are equivalent because of the molecule's symmetry. So the anhydride would be something with two equivalent carbonyls and a bridging oxygen.

Wait, the initial dicarboxylic acid is a cis-alkene. So, when dehydrated, the anhydride would form a five-membered ring? Because anhydrides from diacids usually form five-membered rings if possible. So, if the diacid is cis, then the ring would form with the two ester groups on the same side.

So, the anhydride's structure is such that the two carbonyl groups are adjacent, and the protons on the adjacent carbons are equivalent. So in 1H NMR, a singlet at 7 ppm. That could be two equivalent protons, but wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak. If it's a singlet, maybe each of the two protons is a singlet, but they are equivalent, so it appears as a single peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a triplet or something else, but no, a singlet.

Wait, but how many protons are there? If the anhydride is cyclic, perhaps a five-membered ring. Let's imagine the structure: O=C-O-C-O=C. Wait, no. The structure of an anhydride would be where two carboxylic acid groups lose a water molecule, connecting the two oxygen atoms. So, the structure is O=C-O-C-O=C-O. Wait, no, the actual structure is something like:

O
||
O-C-...-C-O
          ||
          O

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride. For example, if the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COO
