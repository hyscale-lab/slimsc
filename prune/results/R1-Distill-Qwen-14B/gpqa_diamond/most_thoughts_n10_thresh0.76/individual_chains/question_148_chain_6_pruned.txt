Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, let's read through the question carefully. It's about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y, and there are five of them. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and their reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular weight range of A4.

Alright, let's break down the information step by step.

First, the substances are all binary compounds of fluorine and Y. So each A is YF_x where x is some number. There are five, so Y probably has multiple oxidation states.

Starting with A1: It's a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF for A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oF usually stands for oxidation number or maybe oxygen-free? No, in chemistry, oF might be the oxygen-free percentage, but maybe it's the oxidation state of fluorine. Wait, no, fluorine typically has an oxidation state of -1. So maybe oF here refers to the oxygen-free percentage, which would be the mass percentage of fluorine in the compound. Oh, that makes sense. So A2 has 31.96% fluorine by mass.

So if I can find the formula of A2, I can maybe figure out Y. Let's think: the fluorine percentage is 31.96%. Let’s say the formula is YFn. The molecular weight of fluorine is about 19 (since F is ~19 g/mol). So (19n)/(M_Y + 19n) ) = 0.3196.

Hmm, let's suppose n is 1, 2, etc. Let's try n=1: (19)/(M_Y +19) = 0.3196 → M_Y = (19/0.3196) -19 ≈ 60 -19=41. Hmm, 41 is close to Ga (69.7?) No, wait maybe Y is something else. Let me see. Wait, maybe n is 3? Let's try n=3.

So (3*19)/(M_Y +3*19) = 0.3196 → 57/(M_Y +57) = 0.3196 → M_Y +57 = 57/0.3196 ≈ 178 → M_Y ≈ 178 -57 = 121. Hmm, 121 g/mol. That might be a metal. Wait, 121 is close to I (about 126.9), but maybe not exact. Alternatively, 120 is around Sn? No, Sn is about 118.71. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps n is 4? Let's try n=4. 4*19=76. So 76/(M_Y +76) = 0.3196 → M_Y +76 ≈ 76/0.3196 ≈ 237.5 → M_Y ≈ 237.5 -76 = 161.5. Hmm, 160 is around something else. Maybe Y is a heavier element.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the reactions.

A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So A1 → A2 + F2. Since fluorine is a product, and A1 is a binary compound with Y and F, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride that decomposes into a lower one plus F2. For example, if A1 is YF3, which decomposes into YF2 and F2? Or maybe YF4 → YF2 + F2. Let me think about that.

Wait, fluorine is F2, so when A1 decomposes, it produces F2 gas. So, perhaps A1 is a more complex fluoride releasing F2. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a diatomic molecule with F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says A1 is a bright-red substance. Which binary fluorides are bright red? I remember that lead(II,IV) fluoride isn't red, but maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal fluoride. Alternatively, perhaps it's a covalent compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the problem says A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so when it's oxidized, it probably forms XeF2 or XeF4 or XeF6. So A1 must be a strong fluorinating agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so A1 is likely a fluoride that's a strong reducing agent, meaning Y is a metal that can provide electrons.

Wait, if A1 is a fluoride that can oxidize Xe to a higher oxidation state, then A1 must be a reducing agent. So Y must have a higher reducing power than Xe. So Y is a metal that can donate electrons to F, making F the oxidizing agent.

Let's think about metals that form multiple fluorides. For example, metals like tin (Sn) or lead (Pb) form different fluorides. Alternatively, maybe Y is aluminum, but aluminum usually forms only one fluoride. Wait, perhaps Y is something like lead.

Wait, lead forms different fluorides: PbF2, PbF4. Hmm, PbF2 is white, PbF4 is pale yellow. Not sure if any are bright red. Alternatively, maybe Y is antimony? Antimony trifluoride is a bright red solid. Oh! Antimony trifluoride (SbF3) is bright red. Maybe A1 is SbF3.

Wait, but then A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. Let's see: if SbF3 decomposes, what would happen? Maybe it forms SbF2 and F2? Or perhaps another decomposition. Wait, but I'm not sure about that reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, like YF4, which upon decomposition gives YF2 and F2. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine? No, because the compounds are binary with fluorine. Chlorine doesn't form binary chlorides with itself, but that's not relevant. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is tin. Tin forms SnF2 and SnF4. SnF4 is a white crystalline solid. Not sure about the color.

Another thought: the decomposition of A1 produces F2. So perhaps A1 is a fluoride that, when heated, releases F2 gas. So the reaction could be something like 2 YF3 → 2 YF2 + F2. Let
