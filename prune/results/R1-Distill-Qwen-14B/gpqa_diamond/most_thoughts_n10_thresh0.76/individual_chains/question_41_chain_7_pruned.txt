Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the medium's index of refraction. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, where c is the speed in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But wait, in this case, the glass itself is moving, which complicates things.

So the setup is: a light beam is propagating through glass with index n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab frame.

I'm a bit rusty, but I think this involves some relativity. Because the glass is moving, we have to consider how velocities add in different frames. Oh wait, but wait, glass is a medium inside the lab frame. Hmm, or is it that the glass's motion affects the light's speed as seen from the lab?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about reference frames. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So in the lab frame, the glass has velocity v, and within it, the light is moving at c/n. But how do these velocities combine?

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/c²), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame. But wait, this is about the medium moving, not the light's frame. Let me clarify.

In the glass's rest frame (let's call this frame S'), the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. So in that frame, the light's speed is c/n. Now, the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (frame S). So I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, no. Wait. The glass is moving, so in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, but the light is moving within the glass. So perhaps I should apply a velocity transformation from the glass's frame to the lab frame.

Wait, the velocity of the light in the glass's frame (S') is v_light = c/n, right? Because in the glass, light's speed is c/n. So how do we get the velocity in the lab frame (S), where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S.

But wait, let me get the direction right. The glass is moving towards the observer in the lab and in the same direction as the beam. So, the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving at c/n in the direction of the glass's motion.

So, in S', the velocity of the light is u' = c/n (since the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity). Now, to find the velocity in the lab frame S, which is moving at velocity v relative to S' (since the glass is moving at v in S). So using the velocity addition formula from S' to S.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v) / c²). But wait, in this case, c is the speed in a vacuum, which is 1 in the problem statement. So substituting u' = c/n (which is 1/n since c=1) and v is the speed of the glass in S.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify the directions. If the glass is moving towards the observer in S, then in S, the glass has velocity v in one direction. Let me say, for example, the glass is moving in the positive x-direction at speed v in the lab frame. So, in the glass's frame (S'), the lab is moving at -v, right? So the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion, which would be the positive x-direction in S.

Wait, but wait, the glass is moving toward the observer. So if the observer is in the lab frame,
