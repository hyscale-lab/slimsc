Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that electrophilic substitution usually occurs on aromatic rings, and the position where the substitution happens depends on the directing groups present on the ring. Oh wait, the substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct the incoming electrophile to ortho, meta, or para positions.

The question gives six substances, each with a benzene ring and a substituent. They're reacting with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So I need to figure out for each substituent, whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para-directing or meta-directing. Then, based on that, I can determine the major product, which would be the para-isomer's weight fraction.

Wait, but the question is asking to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the one with the least para might be first, and the most last. Or wait, increasing order—so the substances are ordered from the one with the smallest yield of para to the largest.

So each substituent will determine the product distribution. Let me list each substituent and think about their directing effects:

1. С6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Activating groups increase the reaction rate. Since it's an activating group, it's ortho/para-directing. So when bromine does electrophilic substitution, the major product would be para. But wait, sometimes bulky groups might lead to more ortho? No, I think for methyl, the para is major, ortho is minor perhaps.

Wait, in monosubstitution, for activating groups, para is more favored than ortho because the steric hindrance is less. Methyl is small, so para is major.

2. C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a benzoyloxyethyl group? Wait, no, perhaps it's an ester group. Wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So that's a phenyl ester? Wait, perhaps it's a benzyl ester? No, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So it's an
