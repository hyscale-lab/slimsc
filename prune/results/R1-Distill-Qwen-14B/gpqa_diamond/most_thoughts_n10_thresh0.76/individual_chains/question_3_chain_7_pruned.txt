Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. 

First, let me understand what's given. The particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. So σz is the Pauli z-matrix. 

The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. Oh right, the expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

Wait, so I think I should break this down into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx. Because expectation is linear, so ⟨aA + bB⟩ = a⟨A⟩ + b⟨B⟩. That makes it easier.

Let me start with the σz part. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz in state ψ is just the weighted average of the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So the state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The coefficients squared give the probabilities. Oh wait, let me check that the state is normalized. The sum of squares of the coefficients is (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

The expectation value of σz, ⟨σz⟩, is (0.5)^2*(+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2*(-1). Calculating that: 0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that part gives 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now for the σx part. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which isn't diagonal in the σz basis. So I'll need to compute the expectation value differently. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

To compute that, I'll represent ψ as a vector. Let me write ψ in terms of the basis vectors. So ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T, assuming |↑⟩ is the first component and |↓⟩ the second.

The Pauli x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx = [[0 1],[1 0]]. 

Calculating ⟨σx⟩ = ψ† σx ψ. Let's compute ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, another method is to calculate it using the components. The expectation value can be found by:

⟨σx⟩ = |a
