Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if their separation is much larger than the uncertainty, they can be distinguished.

Wait, no. Actually, the energy resolution of the measurement is determined by the uncertainty in energy of each state. So if the energy difference is larger than the sum of their uncertainties, then they can be resolved. Because if they're too close, the uncertainties might make them overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the system. Hmm, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty principle allows for either state, but I'm not exactly sure.

Let me think about the numbers. Planck's constant ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s. Let's compute the energy uncertainties.

For state 1: τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.05e-34)/(2*1e-9) = approximately 5.25e-26 J. To convert to eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ΔE1 = 5.25e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly for state 2: τ2=1e-8 s, so ΔE2 = (1.05e-34)/(2*1e-8) = 5.25e-27 J. Converting to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are ΔE1 ~ 3.28e-7 eV and ΔE2 ~ 3.28e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, I think. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum, then the two states' energy levels might overlap within the uncertainties, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, but the states have different lifetimes. How does that affect their energy uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual ΔE's. But wait, the energy difference is E2 - E1, which is the same as the absolute value of E1 - E2. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of both states. Because if the separation is less than the sum, their uncertainties might overlap.

So let's compute the sum: 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = approx 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV. Way smaller than 3.6e-7. No.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.00001e-7 eV. Also way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is larger than 3.6e-7. So 1e-4 is 1000 times larger than 3.6e-7. So that's way bigger.

D) 1e-8 eV → Which is 0.1 times 3.28e-7? Wait, 3.28e-7 is about 3.28e-7, and 1e-8 is 0.000328e-7, so 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7. So it's not sufficient.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The energy difference required to be resolved is perhaps larger than the uncertainty of each state, or maybe the sum. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of the system, which is the maximum of the two.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because each state has its own uncertainty, so the separation between E1 and E2 must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the two states' energy levels might be within each other's uncertainty, making them appear as a single peak.

Wait, no. Let me think about the lines. Suppose each state has its own energy uncertainty. The total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the two uncertainties. So for the energy difference to be resolved, the separation must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties.

So, the energy difference should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but in our calculations, ΔE1 is 3.28e-7 eV and ΔE2 is 3.28e-8 eV. So the sum is approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 * (1e7) = 1e3 times larger than 3.6e-7.

So that would be way larger than the required sum. So option C would definitely be resolvable.

But wait, the question is which one could be their energy difference. So any option that is larger than the sum of the uncertainties would be acceptable.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 which is 1e-4 eV, much larger than 3.6e-7. So that's good.

What about option D, which is 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is 3.2e-8 is about 0.032 times 1e-7. So 1e-8 is less than the sum (3.6e-7), so it's not sufficient.

So the correct energy difference must be larger than 3.6e-7 eV. Looking at the options, only option C is larger.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the energy difference could be anything above that sum. So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, the lifetimes of the states (\( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)) serve as the uncertainties in time (\( \Delta t \)). The energy uncertainty for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.25 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \approx 3.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.25 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \approx 3.28 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

The total uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states is approximately the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 3.28 \times 10^{-7} + 3.28 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be significantly larger than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is approximately \( 1000 \times 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.
