Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Wait, what's parallax again? Oh right, parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The closer the star, the larger its parallax. Like, the formula I remember is distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (n) changes with plx. So, n is the number of stars in a certain range of parallax values.

If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their actual spatial density is uniform. So, the number density of stars doesn't depend on distance. But wait, when we observe them, the distribution in terms of parallax would change because of the way distances and solid angles work.

Let me think in terms of geometry. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of that shell. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so for a thin shell, it's about 4πd² dr. But wait, since r is in parsecs, and parallax plx is 1/d, then dr = - (1/(d²)) dp, because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Wait, let's think about it properly.

Let me express everything in terms of parallax. So, d = 1/plx. So, when plx increases, d decreases. So, the number of stars in a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx is what we're looking for.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx would translate to a certain range in distance. Let me start by expressing the volume shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume is 4πd² dr. But since we're talking about a unit range of parallax, perhaps we need to find how the number of stars per unit parallax interval changes.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell is dN = n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume). Since it's uniform, n is constant.

But I need to express this in terms of parallax. So, d = 1/plx
