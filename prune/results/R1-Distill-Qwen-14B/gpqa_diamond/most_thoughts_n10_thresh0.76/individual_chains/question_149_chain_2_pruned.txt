Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Hmm, let me read through it again.

The question says that a small peptidic compound has been synthesized, and the 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. So, the integral is correct, but why two peaks?

Wait, the coupling can't be spin-spin because they ruled that out. So, what else could cause two peaks for the same proton? Maybe something related to the structure's symmetry or some kind of isomer.

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected molecule. So, the mass is the same, but there are two different compounds? Or maybe the same compound in different forms.

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be higher, right? Because the precursor would have an extra group, maybe like an additional amino acid or something. But the question says the LC-MS peaks have the same mass as expected. So probably not A.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would have the same molecular weight and their NMR would show the same shifts because they are mirror images. Wait, but in NMR, if the molecule is chiral and has no symmetry, the splitting might not happen. Or wait, in the case of a racemic mixture, each enantiomer would have the same number of protons but in the NMR, if the sample is a racemic mix, wouldn't you see the same integrals and same peaks? Because each enantiomer has the same environment for the protons. Unless the proton is in a chiral environment and the splitting is due to diastereotopicity or something. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the question says "two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton." So same proton, but two peaks. If it were enantiomers, wouldn't each enantiomer have the same alpha-proton environment, leading to a single peak? Unless there's something else causing splitting, but the coupling isn't spin-spin.

C) 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not sure what that means exactly. Maybe during the formation, like if there's an intermediate that hasn't fully reacted and is causing some kind of coupling. Not sure how that would lead to two peaks in NMR with the same chemical shift but different.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. So in NMR, they would show different shifts. But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. Wait, but if the diastereomers have the same alpha-proton environment, they might have the same shift. Or maybe the diastereomers have two different conformations. Or, perhaps they're epimers, like differing in a stereocenter adjacent, which could lead to slightly different shifts but maybe in some cases, similar shifts. Alternatively, maybe the diastereomers are in such a way that the alpha-proton is in the same environment. Hmm. But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, but the integrals add up to 1H. If the compounds are diastereomers, the NMR would integrate each for 1H each, but since the sample has equal amounts, the integral would add up to 2H. But the question says the integral together is 1H, which is expected. So maybe each diastereomer contributes 0.5H each? That doesn't sound right. Or perhaps each diastereomer has one H, but the ratio is 1:1, so the integrals would each be 0.5H, but adding up to 1H. Hmm, that could make sense. But wait, diastereomers would have different NMR shifts, but in this case, the shifts are similar enough that it's hard to tell. Or perhaps it's a case where the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the compound is in a mixture of tautomers, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So the two compounds have same molecular weight. So same molecular formula. So it's either enantiomers or diastereomers. Enantiomers have same formula, same mass. Diastereomers also same formula.

In the NMR, if the two diastereomers are present, and the alpha-proton environment is the same, then the NMR would see them as a single peak. Unless the environment is slightly different, causing splitting. But the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So maybe the diastereomers have slightly different environments but similar shifts.

Wait, but the question says the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So both are the same in each molecule but split into two. Hmm.

Wait
