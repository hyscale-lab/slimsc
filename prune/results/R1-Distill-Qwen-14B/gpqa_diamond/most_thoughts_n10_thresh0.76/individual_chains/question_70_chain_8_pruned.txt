Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. So, the question describes a series of reactions and asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups usually refer to the point group of a molecule, which depends on its geometry.

Let me break down the reactions step by step to figure out what each substance is.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking about what reactions involve 8 equivalents. Maybe something like a metal reacting with a halogen? Wait, 8 equivalents is a lot. Hmm, another thought: in some metal sulfides, maybe? Or perhaps a reaction that forms something with multiple bonds.

Wait, another possibility: if A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, but 8 equivalents would mean a lot of Cl. Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal. Oh, wait, I remember that when copper reacts with chlorine, for example, under certain conditions, it can form CuCl or CuCl2. But wait, 8 equivalents... Maybe the reaction is 2A + B → C? Or another stoichiometry. Wait, 8 equivalents of B per A. So, for each mole of A, 8 moles of B react. So, the formula of C would be A B8? Or perhaps it's a 1:8 ratio.

Wait, maybe it's like a reaction where A is Na (sodium) and B is chlorine. Sodium reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl. But that's a 2:1 ratio. Here, it's 8 equivalents, so maybe it's 1:8. Wait, sodium would have a +1 charge, so perhaps the product would be something like NaB8, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe A is a diatomic solid like I2. Wait, but solid A reacting with gas B. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal with a higher valency. Let's think about lead or something else. Wait, another thought: maybe A is O2 and B is H2? No, that wouldn't make sense. Maybe A is a solid like phosphorus reacting with bromine? Or maybe it's a reaction where A is an element that forms a compound with B in an 8:1 ratio.

Wait, bright red product C. That
