Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is an organic one, and the options are between cis and trans versions of propenyl or butenyl acetates. The NMR data given is:

1H NMR (ppm):
- 7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 (1H, dq)
- 2.1 (3H, s)
- 1.6 (3H, d)

I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns and the coupling constants can tell us a lot about the structure, especially about the neighboring protons and their configurations.

First, looking at the options, Cis-propenyl acetate would have a structure where the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side. Similarly for the others.

Acetate esters typically have an acetyl group (OAc) attached to an oxygen, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, acetates are esters of acetic acid. So it's like R-O-COCH3. So the acetate group is OAc attached via an oxygen to the main chain.

Wait, wait, let me correct that. The structure of an acetate ester is R-O-COCH3. So the ethyl acetate would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH3. So in this case, the ester group is -O-CO-CH3, right.

Now, the given NMR signals. Let's list them:

7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling constant. Maybe a vinyl proton, like adjacent to another proton across a double bond.

5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets. Hmm. So this proton is coupling with two different sets of protons, maybe. Or perhaps it's split by two different neighboring protons each with different J values. Or maybe one set of two protons, leading to a triplet, but I'm not sure.

The other peaks are at 2.1 ppm (3H, s) and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). The singlet at 2.1 is likely the methyl group attached to the carbonyl in the acetate ester. Because in acetate, the CH3 is attached to the carbonyl (COO-), so that would be a singlet because it's not split by any neighboring protons.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a doublet, which suggests it's attached to a CH2 group. Wait, but 3H as a doubletâ€”so maybe it's a methyl group attached to a CH group that's part of a double bond or near branching.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The molecule is something like R-O-COCH3. So the R group is the propenyl or butenyl group with a double bond.

The propenyl group would be CH2CHCH2, but wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but that's allyl. No, wait, maybe I should think of the structure. So, for example, propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. But wait, that would be the structure if the propenyl is in the trans or cis configuration.

Alternatively, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-COCH3 or something else. Wait, but butenyl can have the double bond in different positions. Wait, but the options are butenyl, so perhaps it's a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

Wait, but the question specifies either propenyl or butenyl. So the R group is either propenyl or butenyl.

Wait, the main thing is the structure of the R group
