Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question says that the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial frames of reference. So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me read it again. It says, "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" So, the time experienced by the ejecta is 50 seconds, and I need to find the distance the ejecta has moved from the Galaxy's perspective.

Hmm. So the problem involves time dilation because the two reference frames are moving relative to each other. Oh right, because one is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the other. So, I guess I need to use the time dilation formula from special relativity.

Wait, but wait. The time given is from the ejecta's frame. So, the proper time is in the ejecta's frame. The Galaxy's frame will see a different time. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So, we're looking at the time t' = 50 s. But the Galaxy's frame will see a longer time because of time dilation. Because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving quickly, so their clocks are ticking slower.

Wait, no. Wait, the time in the ejecta's frame is the proper time? Or is it the other way around?

Proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the time interval) happen at the same place. Oh, because the time is measured in the ejecta's frame, which is moving relative to the Galaxy's frame. So, if the start and end events are the same point in the ejecta's frame, then that's the proper time.

Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at different places. So in this case, t' is the proper time, and the Galaxy's frame will
