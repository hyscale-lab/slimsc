Okay, so I have this question about a transmission electron microscope setup. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment because, in electron microscopy, having too much gas can cause issues like electron scattering, which reduces image quality.

But even after creating this vacuum, some gas particles are still present. The mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Factors like pressure, temperature, and volume affect this. 

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. Instead of λ1, it's now λ2. The temperature remains the same, so that's not the variable here. Why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

Hmm, so under normal conditions (when the electron beam isn't active), the mean free path λ1 is determined by the gas particles colliding with each other. But when the electron beam is on, electrons are moving through the chamber. The electrons could potentially interact with the gas molecules.

Wait, electrons have a certain energy, especially since the accelerating voltage is 1000 kV. That's a lot of energy. High-energy electrons can cause various effects. Oh right, in a vacuum, when high-energy electrons pass through a medium (like gas), they can cause ionization. The electrons can strip electrons from gas molecules, creating ions and free electrons.

Wait, so when Mike starts the electron beam, the electrons are moving at a high speed. The gas molecules in the compartment might get ionized because of the electron beam. Ions and electrons are charged, so they might interact more with each other and the chamber walls. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules?

Wait, the mean free path is longer when the pressure is lower because the molecules don't collide as much. But in this case, the pressure hasn't changed; the vacuum pumps are still running, and the pressure is still the same as before. So why did the mean free path change?

Wait a second—mean free path is also influenced by
