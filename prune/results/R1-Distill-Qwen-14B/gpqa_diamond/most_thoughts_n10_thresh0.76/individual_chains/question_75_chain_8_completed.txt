Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is being overexpressed. The person is having trouble overexpressing the protein, so they need to figure out why.

From the scenario, the person introduced a coding sequence with a single influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus. So the construct should produce a protein that starts with HA, then GADD45G. But when they express it, the protein isn't showing up as expected.

Looking at the options, let's think about each possibility.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. A missense mutation changes an amino acid. If the HA determinant is messed up, perhaps the protein won't be recognized by the immune system, but the question is about overexpression. However, the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed at all, so maybe this isn't the main issue. Unless the mutation caused a frame shift or a stop codon.

Option B: The ribosome stops early. That would mean there's a stop codon in the mRNA before the actual end. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. Looking at the DNA sequence, let's see if any such codons appear in the early part. Wait, the given sequence is the plus strand DNA, so we need to look for the mRNA codons. DNA is plus, so mRNA is the same as the DNA but T becomes U. So the mRNA starts with ATG, which is the start codon.

Wait, let me check the sequence. The sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Hmm, the first few codons are ATG (start), TAC is Tyr, CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr, GAT is Asp, GTT is Val, CCA is Pro, GAT is Asp, TAC is Tyr, GCA is Ala, etc. Wait, but the next codon after ATG is TAC. Wait, but looking further down, I see TGA. Let me find that.

Looking through the sequence, I see ...CCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'.

Wait, in the middle, I see a TGA. Let me count. Looking for TGA in the mRNA, which is the DNA sequence but with T to U. So looking for TGA in the DNA would be a stop codon in the mRNA. Because in the mRNA, T becomes U, so the DNA sequence TGA would be UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. So where is this TGA?

Looking through the provided DNA sequence, let me scan for TGA. Let's see: the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... Oh wait, there's a TGA right after AAA.

Wait, the sequence: ...CCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

So let's look for the TGA. Hmm, after the initial part, perhaps in this segment: ...TGA CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA G T... Wait, let me see:

Wait, the sequence is 5' ...AAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost in the sequence, but I think I can find the TGA. Looking for TGA in the DNA: yes, in the middle, after TCT, I see TGA. Let me see, looking for T followed by G followed by A.

Wait, here's a segment: ...TCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TGA in the DNA. Oh, here it is: ...TGA C... Wait, the segment is TGAACGTGG... No, wait, it's TGA followed by ACG. So the DNA has TGA, which in mRNA is UGA, a stop codon. So the mRNA would read UGA, which is a stop.

So in the construct, the coding sequence for GADD45G is preceded by the HA tag. Wait, but if the HA determinant is at the N-terminus, that would be the start. So the construct is HA followed by GADD45G. But if in the coding sequence, there's a stop codon (UGA) early on, the ribosome would stop translating early, producing a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Wait, but the HA tag is added to the N-terminus, so the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. If there's a stop codon in the middle, the ribosome would terminate translation before the GADD45G is fully made.

Wait, but when you look at the construct, the HA tag is a short peptide. If the stop codon is in the HA region, then the HA wouldn't be correctly formed, leading to no functional HA. But the question says that the problem is that the protein is not overexpressed. So perhaps the HA is fine, but the GADD45G part is not being expressed because the stop codon is in the GADD45G coding region.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the sequence would be HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA is correctly added, then the coding sequence continues into GADD45G. But if the GADD45G part has a stop codon, then the protein would be HA plus a truncated GADD45G, or maybe not even that.

Wait, but the given DNA sequence is the plus strand, so the mRNA would be the same except T to U. So the sequence provided is the coding (sense) strand. So the mRNA is synthesized as complementary to the template strand, which is the opposite of the given DNA.

Wait, no. The given DNA is the plus (sense) strand, so the mRNA is complementary to the minus (antisense) strand. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U.

So the mRNA starts with ATG, which is the start codon, then continues with the codons.

But in the given DNA sequence, I see a TGA in the middle. Let me check: looking for the TGA again.

Let me count positions:

The sequence starts with: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

Wait, after the initial part, the codon is TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCA (Ala), etc. Then later on, I see AAA TGA.

Wait, AAA is Lys, then TGA. So in the mRNA, that would be AAA UGA. UGA is a stop codon. So the mRNA would have UGA after Lys.

So the construct's coding sequence has a stop codon after Lys, which would terminate translation early. So the ribosome stops at that point, making a very short protein. But wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the HA would be part of the construct. Or wait, the HA is just a short peptide, maybe 10 amino acids or so. So in the HA, the sequence would be, say, the HA epitope, then the GADD45G cDNA.

But if in the HA's coding sequence, there's a stop codon, the HA itself may not be correctly formed. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is correctly introduced, but the GADD45G coding has a stop codon.

Wait, the person designed the construct to include the HA at the N-terminus. So the HA should be followed by GADD45G. But the presence of a stop codon (UGA) in the middle would cause translation to stop, so the protein would be HA plus a few more amino acids, but not the full-length GADD45G.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So maybe the HA is present, but the rest isn't. Or maybe there's no HA either because the stop is in the HA.

Hmm. Wait, the HA is a short tag, so maybe the HA is correctly translated, but then the stop comes right after, so the HA is fine, but the GADD45G isn't made. So the overall construct would produce a short HA-tagged peptide, but not the full-length GADD45G.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Maybe the construct is not being expressed because the mRNA is being translated and the ribosome stops early, leading to a small peptide that's rapidly degraded, so the overall level of the full-length protein is low.

But why can't the cells express the HA-GADD45G correctly? Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case if there's a stop codon in the construct's coding sequence.

Option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. Wait, but in the DNA, the stop codon is TGA, which in mRNA is UGA. So for D, it's about UAA, which is a different stop codon. So D might not be the issue here.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is triggering proteolysis. So perhaps without a linker, the HA tag and the GADD45G are being processed by proteases, leading to degradation. But the problem is that the protein isn't expressed, so perhaps the construct isn't being translated correctly at all.

Wait, but the presence of the stop codon in the coding sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate early, so the protein is not made beyond that point. So the HA might be correctly made if the stop is after it, but if the stop is within the HA, then the HA wouldn't be made.

But in the given DNA, the HA is at the N-terminus. Let's think about the structure. The person introduced the HA at the start. So the coding sequence is HA followed by GADD45G.

In the given DNA, after the HA, if a stop codon is present, that would cause the construct to produce a truncated protein, but the presence of a stop codon would prevent the full-length protein from being made.

So looking at the given DNA, the sequence has a TGA. Let me count the amino acids before the TGA.

Let me think: the HA is probably a short peptide, like YPYDVPDYA or something. But the construct starts with ATG. Let me translate the DNA into amino acids.

The DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

So the first codon is ATG, which is methionine (start). Next codon TAC is tyrosine (Y). CCA is proline (P). TAC is Y. GAT is aspartic acid (D). GTT is valine (V). CCA is P. GAT is D. TAC is Y. GCA is A. Then AAA is lysine (K). Then TGA is stop.

So the amino acid sequence would be:

Met Y P Y D V D Y A Lys [stop]

Wait, that's only 9 amino acids. Hmm, because the HA tag is usually about 10-11 amino acids. For example, HA is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 residues. So if the stop comes after the 9th amino acid, that would mean the HA isn't properly formed. So the HA might have a few amino acids, but the rest is truncated. So the protein would be just a short peptide, not the full HA and GADD45G.

But wait, the HA is added at the N-terminus. So perhaps the HA is intended to be a longer sequence. If a stop codon is introduced into the HA coding sequence, the HA would be incomplete, and the rest of the GADD45G wouldn't be made. Alternatively, if the stop is after the HA, then the HA is correctly made, but the GADD45G is not.

Hmm, but in the given DNA sequence, the first few codons are part of the HA, right? Because the HA was introduced at the N-terminus. So if a stop codon is present within the HA, the HA itself is not correctly made. For example, the HA might be supposed to be longer, but the stop is introduced, making a shorter HA, and the rest of the GADD45G isn't made.

In this case, the protein would be a short HA peptide, but no GADD45G. So when the experimenters try to overexpress, they might not see the full-length GADD45G, making the overexpression impossible.

But why is the stop codon present in the construct? Did the person make a mistake when cloning?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was introduced but the cloning process added an extra base that introduced a stop codon. Let me think about the HA addition. The HA sequence is introduced as a DNA sequence. If during the cloning, the person added the HA in frame, but perhaps a mistake caused a stop codon to be introduced.

So looking at the DNA, the presence of the TGA (UGA in mRNA) as a stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate early. That would explain why the protein isn't being overexpressed — the ribosome stops translating before the full-length protein is made.

So the reason the protein isn't expressed is that there's a stop codon in the construct, causing the ribosome to terminate early. So the correct answer would be option B, the ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but why is the stop codon present in the construct? The HA is added at the N-terminus, but perhaps the cloning introduced a mutation that added a stop codon. Alternatively, the HA sequence itself might have a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence is correct, but the GADD45G coding has a stop codon. Let me think about the coding sequence. The HA is followed by GADD45G. So the HA is a short tag, then the full GADD45G is added. If the GADD45G has a stop codon, the full-length protein isn't made.

But the DNA sequence given is the construct, which includes HA and GADD45G. The presence of a stop codon (TGA in DNA) in the middle of the coding sequence would cause the ribosome to stop, making a truncated protein.

So, the reason the protein isn't overexpressed is that the construct has a stop codon within the coding sequence. So the ribosome stops early, so the protein isn't made beyond that point. So the correct answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Now, looking back at the options, option B is "The ribosome terminated the translation early."

Another point to consider: If the HA tag isn't correctly formed because of the stop codon, the protein might not be expressed at all. But if the HA is before the stop, the HA could be expressed but incomplete, leading to a small peptide, which might not be detected by Western blot if the antibody targets the HA tag beyond the stop codon.

But in this scenario, the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So the presence of a stop codon would prevent the production of the full-length protein, hence no overexpression.

So the correct answer is B.


The question involves a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is being overexpressed with an N-terminal HA tag. The issue is that the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the construct reveals a stop codon (TGA in DNA, UGA in mRNA) in the coding sequence, which would terminate translation early. This stop codon is located after the HA tag but before the full-length GADD45G protein is translated. As a result, the ribosome stops translating prematurely, leading to the production of a truncated protein or no protein at all. This explains why the full-length HA-GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA sequence would alter the HA tag but would not necessarily prevent the full-length protein from being translated. This does not explain the lack of overexpression.
- **Option B:** The presence of a stop codon (UGA in mRNA) in the construct causes the ribosome to terminate translation early. This matches the observed issue of the protein not being overexpressed, as the full-length protein cannot be produced.
- **Option C:** The lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but the problem here is the absence of the full-length protein entirely, which is more likely due to premature termination rather than degradation.
- **Option D:** The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse, but the stop codon in the construct is UGA, not UAA. This option is irrelevant to the issue.

The correct explanation is that the stop codon in the construct causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed.

**Answer: B**
