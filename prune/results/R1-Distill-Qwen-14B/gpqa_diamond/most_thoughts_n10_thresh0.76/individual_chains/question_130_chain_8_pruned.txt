Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about redshift and detecting objects using ground-based optical telescopes. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. I'm supposed to find the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Since the quasar's light is being absorbed, this is the Lyman-alpha forest phenomenon, right? So the absorption lines we see are from intervening hydrogen clouds along the line of sight to the quasar.

But the key here is about detecting these objects. Wait, the question is about the redshift. Redshift tells us how much the wavelength has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. So if the hydrogen is at a certain redshift, the Lyman alpha absorption (which is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame) will be redshifted to longer wavelengths.

Ground-based optical telescopes can observe visible light, which is from about 400 to 700 nanometers, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. Wait, but wait, 1216 Angstroms is in the far-ultraviolet. So if the Lyman alpha line is observed in the optical range, that would mean the object's redshift is such that 1216 Angstroms becomes within the optical window.

Wait, but the quasars themselves emit in the optical, right? But the absorption lines are from the hydrogen in front of them. So if the hydrogen is at a redshift z, the Lyman alpha line (1216 A) would shift to 1216 * (1+z) Angstroms. For this to be in the optical, which is around 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) and up, we can set up an equation.

So let's find the redshift z where 1216*(1+z) = 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Because if the absorption is at 1
