Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The setup is an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is falling vertically on this aperture. This creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. And we can approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when you have a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot and the first minima at an angle given by something like sin(theta) = λ/(a π) or similar. Wait, no, the first minima for a single slit is at a sin(theta) = λ, right? But wait, that's for a single slit. But in this case, the aperture is a polygon, and as N approaches infinity, it becomes like a circle.

Wait, but wait. When N is very large, the polygon becomes a smooth circle, so maybe the diffraction pattern approaches the single-slit circular diffraction pattern. So the intensity minima would correspond to the points where the path difference causes destructive interference.

But wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has those rings. The first minimum occurs at a certain angle. But I'm a bit confused because I'm mixing up single-slit and circular diffraction.

Wait, no. The problem says monochromatic light falls vertically on the aperture. It's about the far field region, so it's Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern (the Airy disk) has a central maximum and then minima at certain angles. The first minimum is at theta where the Bessel function J1 has its first zero.

Right, the condition for the minima is that the Bessel function J_m (where m is the order) has a zero. For the first minimum of the central peak (the primary maximum), m is 1, and the first zero of J1 is at about 3.8317. So the formula is something like (a sin theta) = (lambda * (3.8317)/ (2*pi)) )? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, wait. The condition for the minima in the far field (Fraunhofer) for a circular aperture is that the phase difference across the aperture leads to destructive interference. The formula I recall is sin(theta) = (lambda * n) / (pi * a), where n is the order of the minima. Or wait, another way: the minima occur when the path difference from opposite edges causes a half-integer wavelength shift. Let me think more carefully.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is given by the Bessel function. The first minimum occurs when J1 is zero. So the first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317. So the condition is that the path difference across the diameter is (lambda) * (2a sin theta) / (wavelength) ) = something. Wait, no, the phase difference depends on the path difference. But perhaps the condition for a minimum is that the path difference is an odd multiple of λ/2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the minima in a circular aperture is sin(theta) = (lambda * m) / (pi * a), where m is the order. So for the first minimum, m=1, so sin(theta) = lambda/(pi a). But wait, I thought the first minimum for a circular aperture was at sin(theta) = 1.22 * (lambda)/(a), because 1.22 is approximately 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 3.83/(6.28) ≈ 0.61, but wait, 3.83/(2*1.57) = 3.83/3.14 ≈ 1.22, yes.

So that's probably the formula they're using. So
