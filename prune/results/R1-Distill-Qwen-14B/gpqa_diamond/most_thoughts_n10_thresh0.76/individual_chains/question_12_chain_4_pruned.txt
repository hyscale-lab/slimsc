Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let me see what I can remember about particle physics and decay equations.

The given reaction is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, right? So the pion is at rest, and it's decaying into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum are conserved.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, what about the neutrino? Oh, right, neutrinos are super light, but I don't think their rest mass is negligible here. Or wait, in these high-energy physics problems, sometimes the neutrino's mass is considered zero for simplicity. Or maybe it's negligible compared to the other masses? I'm a bit confused about that.

So, since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

I think I can model this using conservation of energy and momentum. Let me write down the equations.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, each particle has its rest mass plus kinetic energy.

So, energy conservation:
E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

And momentum conservation:
p_pi_initial = 0 = p_mu + p_nu. So p_mu = -p_nu, meaning their magnitudes are equal.

But since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. So the vectors of the muon and neutrino momenta must cancel each other.

I think I should express each energy term in terms of their masses and momenta. Remembering that E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But since we're working in units where c=1, it's E^2 = (p)^2 + m^2.

So E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 )
Similarly, E_nu = sqrt( p_nu^2 + m_nu^2 )

But wait, the neutrino's mass: if it's considered massless, then E_nu = p_nu. But if it has a mass, it's part of the equation. Hmm, I think in many problems, especially in particle physics, the neutrino is assumed to have negligible mass compared to the other particles. So let's assume m_nu is zero. So E_nu = p_nu.

But wait, that might not be accurate in this case. For example, the muon's mass is 105.7 MeV, which is a significant fraction of the pion's rest mass (139.6 MeV). So the neutrino's mass is probably not zero, but perhaps it's so small that it's negligible. Or maybe the problem expects us to treat it as massless?
