Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product looks like after a series of reactions. Hmm, let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think through each part.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure mentally. So, cyclohexanone with a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is like an isopropenyl group. So that's CH2=C(CH2) attached to the cyclohexane ring.

The first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate things. But wait, where's the acidic proton here? The starting material has a hydroxymethyl group (OH attached to a CH2). The OH is a good leaving group if activated, but maybe it's acting as an acid here. Sodium hydride is such a strong base that it can deprotonate the alcohol, turning it into an alkoxide. So, the -OH becomes -O-.

Once the alcohol is deprotonated to an alkoxide, benzyl bromide (which is an alkylating agent, a primary alkyl bromide) can perform an SN2 reaction. The benzyl group would attach to the oxygen, right? So the hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) becomes a benzyl ether, CH2-O-Bn. So product 1 would be 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the benzyl bromide is adding to the carbonyl group. But the starting material is a ketone, and SN2 on the carbonyl? That doesn't seem right because the carbonyl is electrophilic but the adjacent alpha position is more likely for reactions. Oh, no, wait: the ketone is at position 1, and the alpha carbons are positions 2 and 6. But in this case, maybe the hydride is deprotonating the alpha hydrogen, but that's more for enolate formation. Wait, sodium hydride is such a strong base that it can abstract a proton to form an enolate. But wait, in the first step, the starting material is treated with sodium hydride, which is a strong base. So the initial step could be deprotonating the alpha hydrogen, generating an enolate. Then, benzyl bromide would alkylate the enolate.

Hmm, but the starting material's alpha positions are adjacent to the carbonyl. Let me think. The molecule is a cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. The ketone is position 1. So the alpha positions are 2 and 6. The substituents are at 3 (hydroxymethyl) and 5 (isopropenyl). So are the alpha positions (2 and 6) available for deprotonation? If sodium hydride is used, maybe it deprotonates the alpha hydrogen, forming an enolate which then attacks benzyl bromide. That would add a benzyl group to the alpha position.

Wait, but the starting material has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3. So position 3 is adjacent to the ketone? Let me visualize the cyclohexane ring: positions 1 (ketone), 3 (CH2OH), and 5 (isopropenyl). So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the ketone. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 or 6, forming an enolate, which would then react with benzyl bromide, adding a benzyl group there.

So product 1 would have a benzyl group added to position 2 or 6. Let me think about regiochemistry. Enolates can form at either alpha position, but maybe the more substituted position is favored. Alternatively, maybe the base is strong enough to deprotonate the most acidic alpha hydrogen.

Wait, but the starting material's structure is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. So the substituents at positions 3 and 5 are both on the same ring as the ketone. So, positions 2 and 6 are on either side of the ketone.

If the enolate is formed at position 2, then the benzyl bromide would add a benzyl group to position 2. Alternatively, position 6. Either way, the product would have a benzyl group added to the alpha position of the ketone.

Wait, but considering the positions, maybe the more substituted position is 2, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the proximity of the hydroxymethyl group at position 3 affects where the enolate forms. Enolates form more readily where the resulting conjugate base is more stabilized. So perhaps the site where the resulting enolate is more stabilized would be the major product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not an enolate alkylation but a simple O-alkylation of the hydroxymethyl group. That is, the hydroxymethyl group's OH is deprotonated by sodium hydride to form an alkoxide, which then reacts with benzyl bromide, adding a benzyl group to the oxygen. So the product would have a benzyl group attached to the CH2O group at position 3.

Which pathway is more likely? Well, the starting material has a hydroxymethyl group. Sodium hydride is a strong base, so it can deprotonate the OH. The resulting alkoxide is a good nucleophile and can react with benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, adding the benzyl group to the oxygen. This seems plausible. Alternatively, if the OH is in a position that makes the alpha protons more acidic, then the enolate formation would compete.

Wait, but in the starting material, the alpha protons (positions 2 and 6) are adjacent to the ketone. The pKa of these alpha protons is around 18-20. Sodium hydride is a strong base (pKa of H2 about 35?), so it can deprotonate them easily. But the hydroxymethyl group's OH is even more acidic (pKa around 16-18?), which is similar. So whether the base abstracts the alpha hydrogen or the OH depends on which is more accessible.

In a cyclic ketone like cyclohexanone, the alpha hydrogens are more accessible and perhaps more acidic than the OH group. So maybe the enolate is formed. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, the OH is more acidic here because it's a hydroxymethyl group on a cyclohexane ring. Hmm.

Wait, but after the first step, the product is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in presence of HCl. That sounds like the Wolff-Kishner reaction. Wolff-Kishner is used to reduce carbonyl groups to methylene groups (CH2) by treating with hydrazine derivatives and strong base.

But wait, the Wolff-Kishner conditions are usually
