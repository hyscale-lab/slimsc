Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially grounded ones, the induced charges can affect the potential. Oh right, the conducting sphere being grounded means it's connected to the earth, so any excess charge would flow away. But wait, in this case, the sphere is neutral to start with because it's conducting and grounded. So when charge q is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges.

I think when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's free electrons redistribute. So if q is positive, the electrons (negative charges) in the conductor will be attracted towards the near side of q, and the side away from q will be left with a deficiency of electrons, which is like a positive charge. But since the sphere is grounded, those excess charges on the far side can't accumulate—they'll just flow into the ground. So the sphere ends up with an induced charge opposite to q on the near side. Or wait, no—because the sphere is grounded, the charges can move freely. So when you bring a positive charge near, the electrons in the sphere move towards the near side (since opposite charges attract), leaving the far side positively charged. But because the sphere is grounded, the positive charges on the far side can't stay—they'll go into the ground. So the sphere ends up with an induced charge of -q on the near side and 0 net charge because the excess leaves through the ground. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

Wait, the sphere is neutral initially. When you place a positive charge q near it, the electrons in the sphere are attracted to the near side, making that side negatively charged, and the far side becomes positively charged (since the conductor as a whole remains neutral). But since the sphere is grounded, the positive charge on the far side can't stay—it's connected to the earth, so those positive charges will flow away. So the sphere ends up with a net charge of -q. Because the electrons (which are the mobile charges in a conductor) would have moved towards the near side, leaving the far side positive. But since the sphere is grounded, any excess positive charge on the far side would go into the ground, leaving the
