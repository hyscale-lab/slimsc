Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, after combining the products, they run them on two different HPLC columns and the number of peaks is observed. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I think I should focus on each reaction separately to figure out what the products are. Once I have the products, I can determine how many peaks each product would show in the different HPLC conditions.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one would become hexan-3-ol. But wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5.

So, when LAH reduces the ketone, the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait—LAH is a strong enough reducing agent to also potentially reduce ethers, but methoxy is an ether. Hmm, does LAH reduce ethers? I think it does under certain conditions. Or wait, maybe not. Typically, LAH reduces esters, amides, and ketones, but ethers are generally inert. Wait, no, I think LAH can cleave ethers under certain conditions, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction here only reduces the ketone.

Wait, so in (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3?

No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So the starting molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2?

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me structure it properly. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2C(O)(CH2)2CH3. So the 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon, which is the same as the third carbon from the ketone. Wait, the numbering: For hexan-3-one, the carbonyl is on C3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of positions.

Hexan-3-one: positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3

Wait, no, that's pentan-3-one. Wait, perhaps I should count again.

Wait, hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, that can't be right because that would make it a 6-carbon chain with the ketone in the middle. So, the structure is:

The carbonyl is on carbon 3, so positions are:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, hexan-3-one would have the structure:

(CH2)2C(O)(CH2)3CH3? No, that's 6 carbons. Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's 7 carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's seven carbons. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of:

The structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, no, because hexan-3-one has 6 carbons: 1, 2, 3 (carbonyl), 4, 5, 6.

So, 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps it's not critical for the reaction. The key point is that when treated with LAH (a strong reducing agent), the ketone (3-position) will be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product of Reaction I would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, and the configuration would be R or S?

Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration. Let's think about the reduction. LAH is a strong, bulky reducing agent. Wait, no, wait: LAH is not necessarily bulky. It's a strong reducing agent, but for ketones, it's going to reduce the carbonyl group (C=O) to an alcohol (C-OH).

So, the product would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But since the starting material was chiral (S configuration at the 5-methoxy group?), wait no: the starting material is (S) configuration at which carbon?

Wait, no. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the 5-methoxy is on carbon 5. The ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure is:

Positions 1 2 3 4 5 6.

So, 3 is the carbonyl, 5 is OMe.

So, the molecule is at position 3: (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)2-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to visualize as:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? Not sure. But regardless, the ketone is at 3, so when reduced, it becomes an alcohol at 3, so the product is 3-hexanol derivative.

So, Reaction I gives 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, is this alcohol chiral? Let's see. The 3-position after reduction: so the structure is CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? So the C3 has four different substituents: OH, CH2CH2 (from the left), CH2-OCH3 (from the right?), and the two CH2 groups? Wait, no, the substituents on C3 would be:

- OH,

- CH2CH2 (from the carbonyl side, which is CH2CH2-),

- CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3 (which is a longer chain),

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: The original molecule has a ketone at C3. Upon reduction, the C3 becomes a CHOH group. So the groupings around C3 are:

- CH2CH2- (from the left, positions 1 and 2),

- OMe (from position 5),

- CH2CH2CH3 (from position 6 and 5? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me structure it:

After reduction, the molecule is:

CH2CH2-CHOH-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3?

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The original structure is (from left to right):

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3.

After reduction, C(=O) becomes CH(OH), so:

CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3.

So, the C3 (the OH bearing carbon) has the following groups attached:

- CH2CH3 (from the left),

- CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3 (from the right),

- OH,

- And what else? Wait, maybe:

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-CHOH-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me count the carbons again. The original is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's 6 carbons: positions 1 to 6. The methoxy is on position 5, so:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that would be 7 carbons. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH2CH2CH3. But that may not be right either.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better not to get bogged down in the exact structure and just focus on the fact that the ketone is being reduced. So, after reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, the key point is whether this alcohol is chiral. The OH is on C3, and whether C3 has four different substituents. Let's see:

- Adjacent to C3, we have:

   a) the C2 (which is CH2CH2-),

   b) the C4 (which is CH2-OCH3-...),

   c) the OH,

   d) the rest of the chain?

Wait, perhaps C3 is attached to:

- A CH2CH3 group (from the left),

- A CH2-OCH3 group (from the right),

- An OH,

- And the other side would be, perhaps, another CH2 group?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that C3 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

So, the product from Reaction I is a secondary alcohol, which is chiral. So, it's a single enantiomer, because the starting material was (S) configuration.

Wait, but I'm not completely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the reduction doesn't affect the stereochemistry elsewhere. But perhaps the product is a racemic mixture? No, because the starting material is chiral, but the LAH reduction is a stereospecific reaction? Wait, no, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but for ketones, the reduction is typically not stereospecific because ketone is planar. Wait, but when you reduce a ketone, the addition of hydride occurs from one face. But since the starting ketone is not chiral, perhaps?

Wait, wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is chiral because of the substituents on the C5 (the methoxy group). So C5 has four different groups: the adjacent carbons (C4 and C6), the methoxy, and another group?

Wait, perhaps. So, the configuration is S at C5. Upon reduction of the ketone at C3, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The question is whether the new OH at C3 makes it a chiral center.

So, looking at C3 in the product: substituents would be:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4),

- OH,

- and a longer chain perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps it's better to think that in the product, C3 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So the product is a secondary alcohol with a new chiral center.

But wait, was the configuration preserved? The starting material's configuration is at C5, which is the methoxy group. When reducing the ketone at C3, the stereochemistry at C3 would be created. But since the ketone is not chiral, the reduction would produce a racemic mixture? Or would it produce a specific stereoisomer?

Wait, no. LAH is a strong reducing agent, and it typically adds hydride from a specific face, but in a ketone, which is not chiral, the addition would form both R and S configurations equally, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, in this case, the starting material is chiral at C5. So, would that affect the configuration at C3 during reduction?

Hmm, that's a good point. The molecule is chiral at C5, which is adjacent to C4, which is next to C3. So perhaps the configuration at C5 influences the approach of the LAH hydride. Wait, but LAH is a strong reducing agent that usually doesn't consider the existing stereochemistry, but rather adds hydride in a certain way. I think in this case, the reduction of the ketone to the secondary alcohol would lead to a new chiral center at C3, and the product would be a racemic mixture. But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5, which is a different carbon. So perhaps the reduction doesn't create any new stereoisomer because the approach of the hydride is from one face, but since the starting material is chiral, maybe that affects the outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer. Hmm, I'm a bit unclear on this point. Let me think again: when the ketone is reduced, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. But if the molecule is chiral elsewhere, that might influence the approach. So perhaps the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single enantiomer.

Wait, but since the starting material is (S) at C5, it's possible that the approach of the hydride is influenced by the existing groups, leading to the formation of a specific stereoisomer at C3. So the product would be a single diastereomer or enantiomer.

But I'm not certain. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture because the ketone reduction doesn't depend on the existing stereochemistry elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should move on and come back to this point after looking at Reaction II.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2CH, but wait no, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3, but that's 5 carbons.

Wait, structure: O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, that's 5 carbons, but the positions are 2 and 4. So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, perhaps better written as (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3? No, I think I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Pentane-2,4-dione is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, it's a five-carbon chain with ketones at positions 2 and 4. That's correct.

So, when NaBH4 is added in excess, what happens? NaBH4 is a mild reducing agent that typically reduces ketones. But in the case of a diketone like pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone will be reduced.

Each ketone (C=O) will be reduced to an alcohol (CH2OH). Wait, no, each ketone is a carbonyl, so each will be reduced to a secondary alcohol.

So, the product would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Which is 2,4-pentanediol. Now, the question is, is this diol chiral?

Looking at each of the two OH-bearing carbons (C2 and C4), let's determine if they're chiral centers.

For C2: attached groups are:

- CH3 (from C1),

- CH(OH) (from C3),

- OH,

- and H? Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

Wait, no, because each OH is on C2 and C4.

Wait, for C2: substituents are:

- CH3,

- two CH2 groups (the middle CH2 is connected to C3, which is CH2),

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write it properly.

Structure after reduction:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Each of the two middle carbons (C2 and C4) has the structure:

For C2: substituents are:

- CH3 (from C1),

- OH,

- CH(OH)-CH2-CH3 (or wait, perhaps it's better to see each carbon separately.

C2 has:

- One CH3 group (from C1),

- One OH,

- One CH2-CHOH-CH3 group (from C3 and beyond),

- And another CH2 group (from C3).

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps each of the OH-bearing carbons (C2 and C4) have four different substituents, making them chiral.

Wait, for C2:

- The groups attached are:

   - CH3 (C1),

   - OH,

   - CH2 (connected to C3),

   - and another CH2 (connected to C3).

Wait, no, that can't be. If C2 is CH(OH), then its substituents are:

- CH3 (from the left),

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from the middle), but that would make two substituents the same (the two CH2 groups), which would make C2 not a chiral center.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is such that C2 and C4 each have four different substituents.

Wait, let me think:

The structure after reduction is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, each of the OH-bearing carbons (C2 and C4) has:

- For C2: substituents are CH3 (from C1), OH, CH2 (connected to C3), and another CH2 (from C3). So, that's two CH2 groups on either side. Therefore, C2 has two CH2 groups attached, which are the same. So, C2 is not a chiral center.

Wait, but alternative approach: the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

So, each of the two middle carbons (C2 and C4) is attached to:

- C1: CH3,

- C3: CH2,

- OH,

- and another group?

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to draw it.

C1: CH3-

C2: -CH(OH)-

C3: -CH2-

C4: -CH(OH)-

C5: -CH3

So, for C2:

- Attached groups: CH3 (C1), OH, CH2 (C3), and another CH2 (from C3). Wait, that can't be. Because C3 is a single CH2 group. So, C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and has OH and H. Wait, no:

Wait, no, each carbon in the chain is connected to two adjacent carbons, plus two other substituents. So, for C2:

- Connected to C1 (CH3),

- Connected to C3 (CH2),

- Has an OH group,

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no: in the structure CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3, each of the OHs is on C2 and C4.

For C2:

- groups are CH3 (left), OH, CH2 (right), and a hydrogen.

Wait, wait, that's not correct. No, C2 is CH(OH), so it has four substituents:

- CH3 (from C1),

- OH,

- CH2 (from C3),

- and another CH2 group? No, because C3 is connected to C2 and C4. So, the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3 (left),

- OH,

- CH2 (right, which is part of the chain leading to C3 and beyond),

- and a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).

Wait, so substituents are:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. CH2 (connected to C3),

4. H.

So, four different substituents: so C2 is a chiral center. Same for C4.

Wait, but in the structure, C4 is CH(OH), so its substituents are:

- CH2 (from C3),

- CH3 (from C5),

- OH,

- and H.

So both C2 and C4 have four different substituents, making them chiral centers.

Therefore, the product is a diol with two chiral centers, and the configuration would depend on the reduction.

Wait, but when NaBH4 is used, it's a strong enough reducing agent to reduce the ketones. However, in the case of a diketone, each ketone is reduced, and since NaBH4 is a non-stereoselective reducing agent, each ketone would produce a racemic mixture. But wait, in this case, because we're using excess NaBH4, would it reduce both ketones, leading to both alcohols formed?

Wait, perhaps, but since the two ketones are symmetric, maybe the diol would have two possible stereoisomers. Wait, no, the molecule is symmetrical: the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-CH2-C(OH)H-CH3. So, it's a meso compound.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think about the structure again. If the molecule is CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3, then considering the symmetry, perhaps it's a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. So, the two OH groups are mirror images of each other. Therefore, the molecule would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, which is achiral.

Wait, but if each of the C2 and C4 are chiral centers, and they're mirror images, then the molecule is a meso compound. So, the product would be a meso compound, meaning it has no net chirality. So, the product is a single compound, which is achiral, even though it has two chiral centers.

Wait, but how does that happen during reduction? Because NaBH4 would reduce each ketone, but the product's configuration would lead to a meso compound.

So, the product of Reaction II is meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is a single, achiral compound.

So, Reaction I gives a chiral alcohol, and Reaction II gives an achiral diol.

Now, combining the products from both reactions.

So, from Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral).

From Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol (achiral).

So, when these two products are combined, we have two substances: the chiral alcohol and the achiral diol.

Wait, but wait: how many products are there after each reaction?

Reaction I: when the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is a single enantiomer. After reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since the reduction of a planar ketone (at C3) would lead to the formation of two enantiomers, but because the starting material is chiral at C5, perhaps the reduction is stereoselective. Hmm. Maybe I should re-examine this.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The molecule is chiral at C5. When the ketone at C3 is reduced, the hydride would add from a specific face. The existing configuration at C5 might influence the face from which the hydride approaches.

So, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer at C3, making the product chiral and a single stereoisomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction doesn't depend on the existing stereochemistry, leading to a racemic mixture. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, maybe the product is a single stereoisomer as well.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me make an assumption: the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer (chiral) because the starting material is chiral, and the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3.

So, Reaction I gives a single chiral product.

Reaction II gives a single achiral product (meso compound).

So, combining the two products, we have two different compounds: a chiral alcohol and an achiral diol.

Now, the next step is to run these on HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks are observed in each type of HPLC.

The two chromatography methods are:

1. Normal-phase HPLC.

2. Chiral HPLC (using a chiral stationary phase).

In normal-phase HPLC, the stationary phase is polar (like silica) and the mobile phase is non-polar. The separation is based on the polarity of the compounds. Each distinct compound with a different polarity will elute at a different time, producing a separate peak.

In chiral HPLC, the stationary phase is chiral, and it separates enantiomers. So, if a compound is chiral, it will have two peaks (for each enantiomer). However, if a compound is achiral, it will not interact with the chiral stationary phase and will elute quickly, perhaps as a single peak or not retained at all.

Wait, but wait: when a compound is achiral, it won't be separated by a chiral column. So, for the diol (from Reaction II), which is achiral, it will pass through the chiral column without being separated, and thus would elute as a single peak.

Wait, but in the question, the two products from both reactions are combined and run on both columns. So, the combined mixture contains both the chiral alcohol and the achiral diol.

Let's think about each HPLC column:

For the normal-phase HPLC:

- The chiral alcohol (from Reaction I) is a single compound, but is it resolved based on its structure. Since it's a single compound, it would produce one peak.

- The diol (from Reaction II) is another single compound, which is achiral. So, on normal-phase, it would produce another peak.

So, in total, two peaks on normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but wait, the diol is meso, so it's a single compound. The alcohol is a single enantiomer, so it's another compound. So, two compounds in total, so two peaks in normal-phase.

For the chiral HPLC column:

- The alcohol is chiral. On a chiral column, it would elute as one peak because it's a single enantiomer. Wait, no: a chiral column can separate enantiomers. But if the compound is a single enantiomer, it would give a single peak. Because both enantiomers would have different retention times, but if only one is present, only one peak appears.

Wait, no. Wait, no, if the compound is chiral and you have only one enantiomer, then the chiral column would not separate it into two peaks because there's no other enantiomer to separate. So, it would elute as a single peak.

- The diol is achiral. It will not interact with the chiral stationary phase and will likely elute quickly as a single peak as well.

Wait, but wait: some compounds, even if achiral, can interact with a chiral stationary phase, but not in a way that causes peak splitting. They would elute as a single peak because they don't have any chiral interactions. So, the diol would give one peak.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: when a chiral column is used, it's designed to separate enantiomers. If the compound is achiral, it won't bind to the stationary phase in a way that causes separation. So, it would elute quickly, as a single peak, perhaps.

So, for the chiral column, the alcohol (chiral) would give one peak, and the diol (achiral) would give another peak. So, total of two peaks.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought that the diol is a meso compound and thus doesn't have any chiral centers. So, it's achiral. On a chiral column, it would not be separated into any enantiomers, so it would give a single peak.

So, combining everything:

- On normal-phase HPLC: two peaks (alcohol and diol).

- On chiral HPLC: two peaks (alcohol and diol).

Wait, but that's conflicting with the options given. The options are about the number of peaks in each type of HPLC.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the diol is a single peak on the chiral column. Because the diol is achiral, it won't interact with the chiral stationary phase and may not be retained. So, it would pass through quickly, perhaps as a single peak, but in practice, maybe it doesn't interact at all and just comes out quickly, but still counts as a peak.

So, in the chiral HPLC, two peaks: one for the chiral alcohol, and one for the diol.

In the normal-phase HPLC, two peaks: one for each compound.

Wait, but the options don't have an option with two peaks in both. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 5 peaks in chiral, 4 in normal. No.

Option B: 3 and 2.

Option C:4 and 2.

Option D:3 and 3.

Wait, none of the options have 2 and 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me re-examine Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but could it reduce the ether group as well? Because some reducing agents can cleave ethers. For example, LAH can reduce esters, amides, and even ethers under certain conditions.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the molecule has a ketone and a methoxy group.

If LAH reduces both the ketone and the ether, what would happen?

Wait, the process is:

LAH reduces the ketone to an alcohol.

If the ether is also reduced, the methoxy group (OCH3) would be converted to CH2OH.

So, if both groups are reduced, the product would be 5-(hydroxymethyl)hexan-3-ol.

Wait, but that depends on whether the ether is susceptible to reduction under these conditions.

Hmm, I'm not completely sure, but LAH can reduce ethers to alcohols. For example, the reduction of an ether with LAH would convert it to a diol. So, perhaps in this case, both the ketone and the ether are reduced.

If that's the case, then Reaction I would produce 5-(hydroxymethyl)hexan-3-ol.

So, the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH2-OH-CH2CH3?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think as:

The starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → upon reduction of the ketone and the methoxy group:

The product would have an alcohol at C3 and another alcohol at C5.

So, the product would be 3,5-dihydroxyhexane or something similar.

Wait, but would that be the case?

Alternatively, maybe the LAH doesn't reduce the ether because it's a bulky group. Maybe the reaction conditions don't favor reduction of the ether, so only the ketone is reduced.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find if LAH reduces ethers.

Upon recalling, LAH can reduce ethers under certain conditions. For example, ethers are generally not reduced by LAH unless specific conditions are applied, like heating. But sometimes, ethers can be reduced to alcohols under strong reducing conditions.

So, in this case, if the ether is reduced, then the product would have two alcohol groups, making for a diol. And, perhaps, this diol would be chiral.

But perhaps, in this problem, the ether isn't reduced, and only the ketone is. So, let's proceed with the earlier assumption.

But perhaps the correct approach is that LAH only reduces the ketone, not the ether.

So, in Reaction I, the product is a single chiral alcohol.

Reaction II gives a single achiral diol.

So, combining the two, the mixture has two compounds: one chiral, one achiral.

When run on normal-phase HPLC, each would elute as a separate peak. So, two peaks.

When run on chiral HPLC:

- The chiral alcohol would elute as a single peak (since it's a single enantiomer).

- The achiral diol would elute as a single peak.

So, two peaks in total on the chiral column.

But looking at the options, none have both columns showing two peaks. The options are:

A) 5 and 4

B)3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining how many peaks each product would produce.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think again. If the reaction produces a racemic mixture, then the number of peaks would change.

Wait, earlier assumption: Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer. So, the product is a single chiral compound.

But if the product is a racemic mixture, then we'd have two enantiomers.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer. Does that influence the product?

Wait, no. Because the ketone is at C3, and the starting material is chiral at C5. The reduction of the ketone may or may not lead to racemic mixture.

If the reducing agent adds hydride from both faces equally, then the product would be a racemic mixture (two enantiomers) of the alcohol at C3.

But wait, the starting molecule is chiral at C5, which is on the same carbon chain as the ketone. So, perhaps the approach of the hydride is influenced by the existing configuration at C5, leading to a specific configuration at C3.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer, as the configuration at C5 directs the addition of the hydride.

If that's the case, then the product from Reaction I is a single chiral alcohol.

So, the mixture after both reactions has:

- 1 chiral alcohol (single enantiomer),

- 1 achiral diol (meso compound).

When run on normal-phase HPLC: two peaks (each compound is one peak).

On chiral HPLC: the chiral alcohol is a single peak (since it's a single enantiomer), and the diol is a single peak (since it's achiral). So, two peaks on chiral column.

But the options don't have an option where both columns show two peaks. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Options:

A)5 and4 → no.

B)3 and 2 → no.

C)4 and 2 → no.

D)3 and 3 → no.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the analysis. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, not an enantiomer. Or perhaps it's a racemic mixture.

If Reaction I produces a racemic mixture (two enantiomers), then on a chiral column, they would elute as two separate peaks.

But the starting material is (S) configuration. Would the product be a racemic mixture, or a single enantiomer?

Wait, the ketone is planar, so the hydride can attack from either face, leading to racemic mixture.

But the starting material is chiral at C5. Would that influence the attack? Because the molecule's configuration at C5 could influence the approach of the hydride.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think: in a planar sp2 hybridized carbonyl carbon, the attack can come from either face. If the molecule is chiral elsewhere, does that affect which face is attacked more? 

In some cases, the existing stereocenter can influence the approach of the reducing agent, leading to a preference for attack from a certain face, thereby producing a specific configuration at the new stereocenter.

For example, if the existing stereocenter makes one face more accessible than the other, the reduction may favor attack from that face, leading to a major product with a specific configuration.

If that's the case, then the product from Reaction I would be a single enantiomer, not a racemic mixture.

So, the product is a single enantiomer (chiral).

So, the mixture after both reactions has:

- 1 chiral alcohol (single enantiomer),

- 1 achiral diol.

So, on normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: the chiral alcohol would produce one peak (single enantiomer), the diol would produce one peak (since it's achiral). So, total two peaks.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the diol is not a meso compound and is actually chiral. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione reduced with excess NaBH4.

The product is 2,4-pentanediol.

If each OH is on a carbon that's a stereocenter, but the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound.

So, it's achiral.

So, the diol is a single achiral compound.

So, when run on a chiral column, it would not be separated and would elute as a single peak.

So, in the chiral column, two peaks: one for the chiral alcohol, one for the diol.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the diol is actually two separate diastereomers or enantiomers.

No, wait, earlier analysis suggests it's a meso compound, so achiral.

So, what's the correct option?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction I.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two products: the alcohol and something else.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but perhaps it doesn't reduce the ketone. Wait, no, LAH usually reduces ketones.

Wait, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, and the configuration creates a new chiral center, leading to two enantiomers. So, if Reaction I gives a racemic mixture, then on chiral HPLC, it would show two peaks.

Wait, but the starting material is (S)-configured. So, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer, not a racemic mix.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, so it would have more than one stereocenter.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single chiral compound, and the product from Reaction II is a single achiral compound. So, when run on the two columns:

- Chiral HPLC: two peaks (one for each compound).

- Normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the products from both reactions are each a mixture of multiple compounds. Let me think again.

Reaction I:

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → treated with LAH.

LAH reduces the ketone to an alcohol. If it also reduces the ether, then the product would have two alcohol groups.

If the ether is not reduced, then it's a single alcohol.

Assuming only the ketone is reduced, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Which is a single chiral compound.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → reduces to 2,4-pentanediol (meso compound, single achiral product).

So, two products.

Chiral HPLC: two peaks (one for each product).

Normal-phase: two peaks.

But the options don't have this.

So, perhaps the mistake is in Reaction I's product.

Alternative approach: perhaps the product from Reaction I is not chiral. Wait, can that be?

If the product from Reaction I is not chiral, then:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduces to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is not chiral.

But earlier analysis suggested it is chiral.

Wait, why would it not be chiral?

If the OH is on a carbon that is not a chiral center.

For example, if the carbon has two identical substituents.

So, perhaps the structure after reduction is such that the OH is on a carbon that has two identical groups, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, let's think:

After reduction, the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

The OH is on C3.

Substituents: 

- CH2CH3 (from C1 and C2),

- CH2-OCH3 (from C5),

- CH2CH2CH3 (from C4 and C5? Not sure).

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C3 are:

- CH2CH2 (from left),

- CH2-OCH3 (from right),

- OH,

- and another CH2 group.

If two substituents are the same, then C3 is not a chiral center.

Wait, for example, if the groups are:

- CH2CH2,

- CH2-OCH3,

- OH,

- and CH2CH2CH3.

No, that's four different substituents.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C3 are:

- CH2CH2,

- CH2-OCH3,

- OH,

- and CH2CH3.

No, that would be four different substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- (CH2)2CH3,

- OCH3CH2,

- OH,

- and a CH2.

No, I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not chiral. But I'm not convinced.

Wait, perhaps the answer lies in considering that the products from both reactions are each a single compound, leading to two peaks in each column, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction I.

Let me think again: Reaction I uses LAH, which is a strong reducing agent. LAH can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols, and possibly ethers to alcohols as well.

If both groups are reduced, the product would have two alcohol groups.

So, the product would be 3,5-dihydroxyhexane or similar.

Wait, the structure would be:

HOCH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-OH-CH2CH3?

No, perhaps better written as:

CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH-CH2CH3?

Wait, but that structure would have two OH groups on adjacent carbons, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure has OH groups on C3 and C5.

In any case, if both the ketone and the ether are reduced, the product would be a diol.

Is this diol chiral?

Assuming that the product is a diol with two chiral centers, but whether it's a meso compound or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound. For example, if the two OHs are on symmetric positions, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then even with two chiral centers, it would be a meso compound, thus achiral.

So, if Reaction I produces a meso diol, then it would be achiral.

Similarly, Reaction II produces a meso diol, which is also achiral.

So, then the mixture would have two achiral compounds.

When run on normal-phase HPLC, each would give a single peak, so two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, since both are achiral, they would each give a single peak, so two peaks.

But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces a single chiral diol.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single chiral diol, and Reaction II is a single achiral diol.

So, the mixture has two compounds: one chiral (multiple stereoisomers?) and one achiral.

Wait, but earlier analysis says that Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

So, on a chiral HPLC column, the chiral diol from Reaction I would give two peaks (enantiomers), and the achiral diol would give one peak.

Wait, no, because Reaction I could only give one enantiomer if the starting material is chiral and the reaction is stereospecific.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should think about the options and see which one makes sense.

The options are:

A) 5 and4 → no.

B)3 and2 → I think this is possible.

C)4 and2 → no.

D)3 and3 → no.

Wait, if the chiral column shows three peaks and the normal shows two, that would imply that the mixture has two compounds: one with three stereoisomers and another with one.

But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces two enantiomers (racemic mixture), leading to two peaks on the chiral column, and the diol (achiral) also gives one peak on the chiral column. So, 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal.

That would match option B.

So, let me re-examine Reaction I.

If Reaction I produces a racemic mixture (two enantiomers), then on a chiral column, it would show two peaks (for each enantiomer), and the diol would show one peak. So, three peaks on chiral.

On normal-phase, the two compounds (each a single compound) would show two peaks.

Which fits option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

But why would Reaction I produce a racemic mixture?

Because the ketone is being reduced, and the starting material is chiral elsewhere, but the reduction is not stereospecific. So, the ketone is planar, leading to racemic mixture.

Wait, but the starting material is chiral, but the ketone is at a different position. So, the approach of the hydride would be from both faces, leading to a 50:50 mix of R and S at C3.

So, the product is a racemic mixture, giving two enantiomers.

Thus, on chiral HPLC, each enantiomer would give a separate peak, and the diol (achiral) would give another peak. So, three peaks on chiral.

On normal-phase HPLC, the two compounds (the racemic mixture counts as one compound, and the diol as another) would give two peaks.

So, the correct answer would be option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

Wait, but wait. If the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, then the mixture contains two enantiomers and the diol. So, the total number of compounds is three.

Wait, no, the racemic mixture is one compound, but it has two enantiomers. So, on the chiral column, it would show two peaks (for each enantiomer), and the diol would show one. So, three peaks.

On normal-phase, the two compounds (racemic mixture and diol) would show two peaks. Because the racemic mixture is a single chemical entity, but with two stereoisomers, but on normal-phase, they would elute together as one peak.

Wait, no. On normal-phase HPLC, the separation is based on physical properties, not stereochemistry. So, the two enantiomers would have the same physical properties (same retention time) on normal-phase HPLC. So, the racemic mixture would appear as a single peak on normal-phase.

The diol would also be another single peak. So, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, the racemic mixture would show two peaks, and the diol would show one. So, three peaks.

Thus, the answer would be option B: 3 and 2.


To determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, we analyze the products of the two reactions and their behavior on the two types of HPLC columns.
