Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles the same, right? So the lattice is a cube that's been compressed or stretched along the diagonals, but each edge is the same length and each angle is the same. 

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance... I think that's the distance between atoms in the lattice, which would be the edge length 'a' of the unit cell. Oh yeah, because in a crystal, the atoms are arranged at the lattice points, so the interatomic distance is the edge length a. So a = 10 Å.

The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Since it's a rhombohedral structure, all angles are equal. So for a rhombohedral lattice, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been skewed, but all the edges are the same length a, and all angles between edges are the same.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember that for a cubic system, the interplanar distance d can be calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2), where hkl are the Miller indices of the plane. But wait, that's for a cubic system, right? Rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system? Or wait, no—rhombohedral is part of the cubic system when all angles are 90 degrees, but when angles are not 90, it's a separate system. So the formula might be a bit different.

Oh wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = (1/√(h² + k² + l² + ... )) times something involving the lattice parameters and the cosines of the angles. Because in a general crystal system, the angles between the lattice vectors come into play.

The general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = (1/√( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (a^2) )) ) divided by a factor that accounts for the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, I think the actual formula is:

d = [ (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a b (hk cosγ_13 + ... )) ]^{-1/2} ?

Hmm, maybe I should recall the correct formula. Oh right, the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (b² c² sin² α) + k^2 (a² c² sin² β) + l^2 (a² b² sin² γ) + 2 h k a b c (cos α cos β - cos γ) + 2 h l a b c (cos α cos γ - cos β) + 2 k l a b c
