Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with reactions, especially nucleophilic additions, the reagents play a big role in determining the product.

Looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, what typically happens? I think ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a nucleophile. So NaCN would provide the CN-.

In the presence of an acid catalyst, like H3O+, the ketone would get protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh wait, a cyanohydrin is when a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group are added across the carbonyl. So the product would have both groups attached to the former carbonyl carbon. That makes sense because the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the first reagent A is probably H3O+ as a catalyst.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form the corresponding acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hmm, so what's happening here? Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. I remember that hydrolysis of nitriles usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, what's the typical reagent for hydrolyzing nitriles to carboxylic acids? I think under acidic conditions, like HCl and heat, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, sometimes you use a strong base like NaOH and then acidify. But looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile must have undergone hydrolysis.

But in this case, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So the nitrile is at the beta position relative to the hydroxyl. Wait, no, the structure is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, so the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. Oh, wait, no, the formula is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Let me think: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2-CH(OH)-CN? Or maybe it's (CH3)C(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. 

Wait, regardless, the nitrile group is next to the hydroxyl group. So when we hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, the existing hydroxyl group may act as
