Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let's try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question gives me data about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass greater than our Sunâ€”1.5 and 1.2 times, respectively. But wait, does the mass matter for this particular question? The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. I remember that elemental abundance ratios are what's important here, so maybe the masses are just extra information that doesn't directly affect this calculation. I'll keep that in mind but focus on the abundance data.

The given data includes the following:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the abundance of silicon relative to iron in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's ratio.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is 0.3 dex higher than the solar ratio.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. Fe/H for Star_1 is the same as the Sun's. So the iron abundance is solar.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Similarly, magnesium in Star_2 has the same abundance as the Sun.

Wait, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2. So it's (n_Si, Star1) / (n_Si, Star2) = ?

I think I'll need to find the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen, then take the ratio.

But wait, maybe I can find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio.

I remember that the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or is it scaled by the solar ratio? Let me get that right. Oh right, the notation [X/Y] is defined as log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic ratio relative to the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means log(Si/Fe)_1 = log(Si/Fe)_sun + 0.3.

And [Fe/H]_1
