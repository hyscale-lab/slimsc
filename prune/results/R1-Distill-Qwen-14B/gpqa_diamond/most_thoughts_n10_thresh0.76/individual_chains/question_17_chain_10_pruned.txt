Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions and EDTA complexes. Hmm, let me think. I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, what's the formula for the complex? Oh right, I think the Ca-EDTA complex is usually Ca-EDTA^2- or something like that. So the formula would be CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA. The formation constant, K, is for the reaction Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- â†” CaEDTA^2-, right?

So the formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. I'm assuming that the complex doesn't dissociate much because K is large, so the dissociation is minimal. That makes sense because a large K means the reaction favors the product, so the complex is stable and doesn't break down much.

So let me model this. Let's say the concentration of the complex is C = 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Then, the K expression is K = 5e10 = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, the EDTA exists in different protonated forms. Oh wait, the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form because the pH is such that deprotonation is complete. Or perhaps the problem simplifies it by assuming that the EDTA is entirely in the form that can react, so [EDTA^4-] is what's relevant.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates.
