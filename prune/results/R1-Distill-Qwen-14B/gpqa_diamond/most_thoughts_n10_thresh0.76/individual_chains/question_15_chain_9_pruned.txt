Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time and want the best chance of success.

Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, the masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right?

The stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, their radii are the same. Maybe because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, like a subgiant or something, which could have expanded a bit but not too much.

The question is about the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Wait, but I think the main factor here is the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The formula I recall is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since R_planet is negligible compared to R_star, it's roughly R_star / a. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by some function... Maybe it's (R_star / a) times the solid angle or something. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, the probability, P, that a planet transits is given by P â‰ˆ (R_star / a) * (1 / (e * (1 - e^2)^0.5)) ), but since both orbits are circular, e=0. So that term simplifies to 1/(something), but in this case, since e is zero, maybe the
