Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, I need to remember what each symmetry means and whether operators in SMEFT have to obey them.

I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension, like dimension 6 being common.

So, what symmetries are preserved? Well, the Standard Model itself has certain symmetries. SMEFT should preserve the same symmetries as the SM because it's an effective theory built upon it. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Wait, but what about CP?

Wait, the Standard Model doesn't have a global symmetry for CP; some of its operators can violate CP. The CKM matrix has complex phases leading to CP violation. So, the SM doesn't respect CP symmetry. Therefore, in SMEFT, operators can also violate CP. So, I don't think CP symmetry is necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. Because if the SM doesn't have to respect it, then neither would the SMEFT operators.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT is an effective theory, so it's built by adding terms that are allowed by the symmetries of the SM. Because the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, the operators in SMEFT shouldn't require CP either. So, operators in SMEFT can violate CP if the SM allows it.

Now, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So for each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, so all its operators (and the SMEFT additions) must be Lorentz invariant. So yes, operators must respect it.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since Lorentz is already a yes, and translations are part of Poincare. The SM respects Poincare, so SMEFT operators should too. So this is a must.

3. CP symmetry: As I thought earlier, the SM doesn't have to respect this, so SMEFT operators don't either. So this symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators. So 3 is incorrect.

4. CPT symmetry: The SM respects CPT symmetry. I remember that CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The SM has CPT symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT must also respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected by all SMEFT operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but Poincare includes Lorentz? Or is it the other way around? No, Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if the operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question lists them as separate. So in the options, 1 and 2
