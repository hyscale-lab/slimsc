Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I remember that K usually stands for the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion.

So, the Ca-EDTA complex would be something like CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA ion. The reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. Since K is a large number, that means the complex is very stable, so most of the Ca²+ would be tied up in the complex, right?

But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Because the complex is formed, the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really low. So we need to find [Ca²+] when the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

The formation constant equation is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But in this case, the solution is stoichiometric, meaning that all the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA. So initially, there was some Ca²+ and EDTA, and they formed the complex. If the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentrations must have been such that they completely reacted.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, then that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But how much Ca²+ is free?

Since EDTA is in excess? Or is it a 1:1 ratio? Because the stoichiometric ratio is 1 Ca²+ to 1 EDTA^4-. So if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, that means the concentration of Ca²+ comes from the dissociation of the complex.

So the dissociation is: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The K for this dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant. Because formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]), so the dissociation constant, Kd, would be 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, right. So Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = 2e-11.

But in a stoichiometric solution, maybe the concentration of EDTA is in
