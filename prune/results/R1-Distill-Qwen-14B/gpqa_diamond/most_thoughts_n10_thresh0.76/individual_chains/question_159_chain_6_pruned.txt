Okay, so I've got this question here about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The question is about figuring out the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth based on the given cosmological parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my cosmology, but let's think this through.

So the key observation is that the flux drops significantly at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. Wait, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light across the spectrum, but the specific peak at about 790 nm is interesting. Oh wait, 790 nm is in the near-infrared. But how does that relate to the distance?

Wait, I think this has to do with redshift. When a quasar is moving away from us, its light gets redshifted. So if a peak that should be in the optical is moving into the infrared, that suggests a significant redshift. Let's think about the typical emission lines. For example, the Lyman alpha emission line is at about 121 nm. If that line is redshifted to 790 nm, that would give me a redshift z.

Wait, let me calculate that. The formula for redshift is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1 = z. So observed is 790 nm, rest is 121 nm. So 790 / 121 = approximately 6.5289. Subtract 1 gives z â‰ˆ 5.5289. So z is around 5.5.

Wait, but wait. The
