Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm. It says the system is a particle of mass m in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator potential, like a 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator. And the question is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be found by considering the energy levels in each of the three dimensions (x, y, z) and adding them. Each direction contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, which can be 0,1,2,... So the total energy is something like (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ℏω, right? Because each dimension contributes (n_i + 1/2)ℏω, and adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ℏω.

So the energy levels are grouped by the sum of the quantum numbers. The energy depends only on this sum. For example, the ground state is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. Their sum is 0, so energy is (0 + 3/2)ℏω = (3/2)ℏω.

The first excited state would be when the sum is 1. Like (1,0,0), (0,1,0), or (0,0,1). But wait, the sum n_x + n_y + n_z = 1. So the energy is (1 + 3/2)ℏω = (5/2)ℏω. Hmm, but the question is about the third excited state. Wait, I need to clarify what exactly is considered the first, second, etc., excited states.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. In one dimension, the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, then n=2, etc. In three dimensions, the states are labeled by their total quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each state with the same n has the same energy.

So the energy levels are E_n = (n + 3/2)ℏω, where n is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...).

The ground state is n=0, E = 3/2 ℏω.

The first excited state would be n=1, E=5/2 ℏω.

Second excited state is n=2, E=7/2 ℏω.

Third excited state is n=3, E=9/2 ℏω.

So the energy for the third excited state is (9/2)ℏω, which matches option A and C.

Now, the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, how many distinct states have the same energy E_n? So, for each n, we need to find the number of possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that n_x + n_y + n_z = n.

Wait, that's a combinatorial problem. For a given n, the number of states is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n. But each of these corresponds to a different eigenfunction, as long as they are not the same. But wait, in 3D, the states are not all necessarily degenerate. Wait, no, the energy depends only on the sum, so all states with the same sum n have the same energy. So the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions) is the number of such solutions.

So for n=3, how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) are there where each n_i is a non-negative integer and sum to 3. Let's calculate that.

This is a stars and bars problem. The formula is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) )= (n + 2 choose 2). So for n=3, that's (3+2 choose 2) = 5 choose 2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

So looking at the options, option A says energy (9/2)ℏω and 10 eigenfunctions. Option C says same energy but 3 eigenfunctions, which doesn't fit.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass \( m \) in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels of such a system are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) associated with the three spatial dimensions. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. The energy depends only on the sum \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \), so states with the same \( n \) have the same energy. The degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) for a given \( n \) is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = n \), which is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2}.
\]

For the third excited state, the quantum number \( n \) is 3 (since the ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second to \( n = 2 \), and the third to \( n = 3 \)). The energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for \( n = 3 \) is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.

Option A matches these results, while the other options are inconsistent with the calculations.
