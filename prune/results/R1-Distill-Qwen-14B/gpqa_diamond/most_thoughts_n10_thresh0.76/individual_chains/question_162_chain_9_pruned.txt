Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. 

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because there are dx² and dy² terms. So this is a 2D spacetime, probably a maximally symmetric space or something.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid or something. But wait, in this context, I think the term might be used differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sphere in a space with constant negative curvature, so in this metric, the geometry is hyperbolic.

Wait, but the options include 0, 4π(x² + y²), etc. Hmm, the radius is given as r=2. I'm trying to remember how the area of a sphere works in different geometries. In flat Euclidean space, the area is 4πr². But in hyperbolic space, the area is different because the space is curved.

Wait, but the metric here isn't the standard hyperbolic metric. Let's think about the form of the metric. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). That denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²). So when (x² + y²) approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, which might mean that's the boundary of the space. So this is probably a model of hyperbolic space, perhaps the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk has a metric of the form (4/(R² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk and R is the radius of the disk. Comparing that to our metric, maybe it's similar. Wait, in our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²) which is 4 - (x² + y²). So if we consider x² + y² = r^2, then the denominator is 4 - r². So if the radius of the disk is 2, since 4 is 2², that fits because in the Poincaré disk model, R is the radius of the disk.

So the metric is similar to the Poincaré disk model with R=2. Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the entire disk is the hyperbolic plane, and the boundary at radius 2 is at infinity in hyperbolic terms.

Wait, but a pseudosphere is a finite surface in hyperbolic space. No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. A pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, but in this context, perhaps the problem is referring to a 2-sphere in this metric. Or maybe it's about a surface of constant negative curvature embedded in 3D space, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of a spatial slice in this metric. Wait, but the metric is
