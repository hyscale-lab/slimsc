Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So, I need to figure out what structure Compound A has based on this NMR.

Hmm, NMR signals can tell us about the environment of the protons. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably from two sets of equivalent CH3 groups. A triplet in such a region makes me think of a methyl group next to another group with two protons. Wait, or maybe it's a di-substituted something. Oh, wait, 6H suggests maybe two methyl groups each with three H. So that's 2Ã—3=6H. And a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet usually comes from a CH2 next to a CH3 or another CH2. Since it's 4H, maybe two CH2 groups each with two H.

Putting this together, perhaps it's a di-substituted ethane? Or maybe a cyclohexane derivative. Alternatively, a diethyl ether? No, wait. Let me think. Let me think about a structure where two methyl groups are each attached to something that gives a triplet. Like maybe each methyl is next to a CH2 group. So maybe (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, that might not give the right splitting. Alternatively, could it be a cyclopropane ring? No, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the triplet (6H) and quartet (4H) could suggest that the 6H are from two methyl groups each attached to a CH2. Let me think: if we have a structure like CH2CH2 where each CH2 is connected to a CH3. Oh wait, maybe it's 2-methylpropane or something else. No, wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane with two methyl groups opposite each other. Or perhaps ethyl groups attached to something.

Wait, maybe the structure is that of neopentane or something similar. Or maybe it's ethyl groups attached to a central atom, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ether, but then
