Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and it's creating intensity maxima and minima in the far field. They're asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Also, they mention that the angles involved are small, so we can approximate tanθ with θ.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with diffraction patterns, the shape of the aperture affects the pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a certain angle, but here it's a polygon. They say N is infinitely large, which makes me think of a shape approaching a circle. Wait, but if N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon becomes indistinguishable from a circle. So maybe the problem reduces to the circular aperture case.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the apothems are all the same length. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem relates to the radius of the circumscribed circle. Wait, no, the apothem (a) is different from the radius (r). The apothem is a = r * cos(π/N), right? Because each side's midpoint is at a distance a from the center, and the radius is related to the side length.

But if N is very large, then π/N is very small. So cos(π/N) is approximately 1, because for small angles θ, cosθ ≈ 1 - θ²/2, which is close to 1. So a ≈ r, meaning the apothem equals the radius when N is large. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. Because the apothem is a, and when N is infinite, the shape is a circle with radius a.

So, the problem becomes: for a circular aperture of radius a, what is the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field?

I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur at angles θ where the path difference between light diffracted from opposite ends of a diameter is a multiple of λ. The formula for the minima (dark fringes) is given by a * sinθ = m * λ, where m is an integer, and for the minima, m is 1, 2, etc.

Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. The condition for the first minimum is when the path difference is λ. But wait, the formula I remember is a * sinθ = m * λ, but m starts from 1 for the first minimum. Wait, no, is that correct? Let me think. For a circular aperture, the condition for a minimum is that a * sinθ = m * (λ/2), but wait, no—I might be mixing it up with the double-slit formula.

Wait, no, the correct condition for the minima in a single-slit (or circular) diffraction is when the
