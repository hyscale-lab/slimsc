Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH, which probably leads to some kind of elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. The product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR and IR data are given.

So, first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they usually undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkene. This is called dehydrohalogenation or the E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in adamantane, the elimination would form a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene or maybe a diene somewhere else? Wait, but wait, the product after elimination is probably adamantane with a double bond.

But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules when heated with KOH. So the structure would become a diene, but actually, in adamantane, the structure is a diamondoid, so the positions are specific. So the product after elimination would be a diene, but perhaps it's more likely to form a mono-alkene, but considering the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's a conjugated diene? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more substituted alkene because of the structure of adamantane.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), probably a triplet or a quartet, maybe an -OH or an ether's CH2? But wait, after elimination, perhaps it's an epoxide? Because the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is around the carbonyl region. Oh wait, 1720 is more like an ester or ketone. Alternatively, an epoxide's C-O
