Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I remember that paramagnetism has something to do with the magnetic field affecting the energy levels of electrons. 

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Oh right, the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Wait, small m... I think m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, for example. But wait, no, in the hydrogen atom, the orbital quantum number l determines m, which can range from -l to +l. So maybe m is 0 or 1 here.

The problem is about comparing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which includes the paramagnetic term) with the transition energy ΔE. The transition energy is given with a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers. That wavelength corresponds to a specific spectral line of hydrogen, probably the Balmer series. Let me think, the Balmer series is for transitions ending in the n=2 level, and the wavelength 0.4861 μm is about the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=3 to n=2. So ΔE would be the energy difference between these two states.

Wait, no. The Balmer series starts at n=∞ to n=2. The H-alpha line is n=3 to n=2. Let me calculate the energy of that transition. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n =
