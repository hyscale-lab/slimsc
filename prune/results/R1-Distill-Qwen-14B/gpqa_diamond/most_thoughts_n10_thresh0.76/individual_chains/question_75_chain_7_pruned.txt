Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a mouse model study involving the GADD45G protein and its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The researcher is trying to overexpress this protein using a transgenic approach. They introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, which is an antigenic determinant for affinity purification.

But when they started, the overexpression didn't happen as expected. They checked the construct's plus strand sequence and found something wrong. The possible answers are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is the issue.

So, the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. Let me think about the possible reasons. If the construct is designed correctly, the gene should be expressed, leading to the protein's production. But if something's wrong in the construct, the gene might not be expressed properly.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So, the HA tag's sequence might have a change, but would that prevent the protein from being expressed? Well, a missense mutation could change the amino acid, but if the reading frame isn't messed up, the protein might still be produced but with a different tag. I don't think this would prevent expression entirely, unless the mutation caused a premature stop codon or messed up the reading frame. But if it's just a substitution, the protein might still be made but not recognized by the antibody. Hmm, but the question is about overexpression, not detection. So maybe that's not the main issue here.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That suggests a premature stop codon. Wait, in which frame? The mRNA is read in triplets. If there's a stop codon introduced early in the coding sequence, the ribosome would stop, leading to a truncated protein. But if the construct is designed with the HA tag at the start, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, any ATG in the wrong place could cause issues. Let me look at the provided sequence.

Looking at the plus strand, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The first few nucleotides are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Wait, hold on. ATG is the start codon, right? Then the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA (Pro), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), etc. Wait, then I see TGA somewhere. Oh, in the middle, there's a TGA. Let me count the letters.

Wait, the sequence is long, but let me look for any in-frame stop codons. The first ATG is the start. Then, the next codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAA, TGA. Wait, TGA is a stop codon. Oh! So in the plus
