Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm, it's about an electron's state and some operator's eigenstates. Alright, let's break it down.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, so it's a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. But it's proportional, so I probably need to normalize it first. Because to find probabilities, the state has to be normalized.

First, I should express |alpha> as a normalized vector. Let's compute the normalization factor. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. The norm would be the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

So the magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). Similarly, for (2 -i), the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). Then, the square of the magnitude is (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 = 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) times [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Next, the problem mentions another operator whose matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, matrix elements. So for a 2x2 matrix, because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles (since it's an electron). So the matrix would be:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Because when i≠j, the element is hbar/2, and when i=j, it's 0. So this matrix is a 2x2 with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, what kind of operator is this? It looks like the Pauli matrices scaled by something.

Wait, let me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So our matrix A has elements 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So it's similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the X matrix has 1s where A has hbar/2. So A = (hbar/2) * X.

Since the Pauli X matrix is a Hermitian matrix, A is also Hermitian, which is good because it's an observable. So the eigenvalues of A can be found by solving the characteristic equation.

The eigenvalues of X are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So the eigenstates of A
