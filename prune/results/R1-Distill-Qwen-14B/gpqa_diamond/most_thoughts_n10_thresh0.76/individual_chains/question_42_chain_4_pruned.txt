Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

Alright, the question says that there are three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3, with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, but I don't think that's relevant here. The key points are the equilibrium temperature ratios and the mass ratios between the planets. We need to find out by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

So, the given data:
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4, which means T2 = T1 / 1.4.
- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3, which gives T3 = T2 / 2.3. Substituting T2 from before, T3 = (T1 / 1.4) / 2.3 = T1 / (1.4 * 2.3). Let me compute that: 1.4 * 2.3 is about 3.22. So T3 is T1 divided by 3.22, which is approximately 0.31 T1. So T3 is lower than T1.

Mass ratios:
- M1/M2 = 1.15, so M2 = M1 / 1.15.
- M2/M3 = 1.35, so M3 = M2 / 1.35. Substituting M2, M3 = (M1 / 1.15) / 1.35. Let me calculate that: 1.15 * 1.35 is about 1.5525. So M3 = M1 / 1.5525 ≈ 0.644 M1. So Planet3 is less massive than Planet1.

The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. So that's a fixed value, which probably factors into the equilibrium temperature formula.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So, the period ratio P3/P1.

Hmm, what determines the orbital period of a planet? Oh right, Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis divided by the sum of the masses. But wait, in the case where the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, the sum is approximately the star's mass. But in this problem, the question is about planets orbiting the same star, I assume, so the star's mass is the same for all three. However, the problem doesn't mention the star's mass, so perhaps we can assume it's the same for all planets. So, Kepler's third law simplifies to P² ∝ a³/(M_star), but since M_star is same for all, P² ∝ a³.

But wait, Kepler's law in the context of a planet orbiting a star can be written as P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) * a³. But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate it as P² = (4π²/(G M_star)) * a³. So, if all three planets orbit the same star, then P² is proportional to a³.

Wait, but in this problem, the planets are in a system, but I'm not told whether they are orbiting the same star. Hmm, but the question says it's a system of three exoplanets, so they should all orbit the same star. So, P² ∝ a³.

But the question is about the periods of the planets, so we need to find a way to relate their periods to other given parameters, such as their temperatures and masses.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ ( L (1 - a)
