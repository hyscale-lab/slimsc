Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle and an electron's energy uncertainty. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is involved here. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. The options are A to D, which are all around 10^-something joules.

Wait, I think the Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, maybe I should use the equality case, so Δx * Δp = ħ/2. Right.

So first, I need to find Δp. Momentum p is mass times velocity, but since there's uncertainty, it's Δp = mΔv. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, if the velocity is known precisely, then the uncertainty in momentum might be m*v Δx or something else. Hmm, maybe I should approach it via the momentum uncertainty.

Let me get this straight. The Uncertainty Principle gives Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). Oh wait, but wait. Because the electron is moving with speed v, maybe the uncertainty in velocity is related. Or perhaps not, because the problem states the speed is v, but the uncertainty is in position. Hmm, perhaps the momentum is calculated using that speed. Or does the uncertainty in momentum come from the uncertainty in position via the formula?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the momentum's uncertainty based on the position uncertainty. Because the electron is localized within Δx, so the uncertainty in momentum comes from that.

So, let's compute Δp. So, using the formula Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Because I'm taking the equality for minimum uncertainty. Wait, but wait, ħ is h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Let me plug in the numbers. Δx is
