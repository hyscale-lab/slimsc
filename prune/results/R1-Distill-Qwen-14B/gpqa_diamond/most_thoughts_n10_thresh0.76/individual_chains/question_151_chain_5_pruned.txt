Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. So the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. The system's state is given as a column matrix, and the observable is a matrix operator P. The outcome we're interested in is 0.

Wait, right. In quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by an operator, and the state is a vector. To find the probability of a particular measurement outcome, I need to find the eigenvectors of the operator corresponding to that outcome and then compute the inner product between the state and each eigenvector.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The observable P has eigenvalues which are the possible measurement outcomes. So the possible results are the eigenvalues of P. The problem asks for the probability of getting 0, so I need to find the eigenvectors of P that correspond to the eigenvalue 0.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Because if the observable is a projection operator, then the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace. But in this case, I'm not sure if P is a projection operator.

Wait, looking at the matrix P:

First row: (0, 1/√2, 0)

Second row: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)

Third row: (0, 1/√2, 0)

Hmm. Let me check if this is a projection operator. A projection operator should satisfy P^
