Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the problem is about determining which system is more massive and by what factor. Let me see.

The question says there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, in spectroscopic observations, the radial velocities (RV) of the stars vary sinusoidally. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. 

I remember that in binary stars, the more massive star is usually the one that's less luminous or less massive in terms of velocity? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a binary system, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star would have a smaller orbit, right? Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive object. So their velocities would be inversely proportional to their masses. Oh right, because if one star is more massive, it doesn't have to move as much for the system to balance. 

So the formula for the mass function might come into play here. Or maybe the velocity semi-amplitude relates to the mass ratio. Let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion. The formula I think is K = (v * sin i) / (1 + q), where q is the mass ratio (m2/m1). Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that in a spectroscopic binary, the velocity semi-amplitude is given by K = ( (2Ï€G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i)/( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) (1 + q)^2 ) ), but that might be getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. Both stars in a binary system orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit and thus a smaller velocity. So if in system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5, that means one is moving faster than the other. Let's call the stars in system_1 Star A and Star B. Star A has K_A = 10 km/s, Star B K_B =5 km/s. So their velocities are in a ratio of 2:1. Since velocity is inversely proportional to mass, the masses should be in the inverse ratio. So if velocity is K, mass would be inversely proportional to K. So Star A has mass 5/(10) times Star B's mass? Wait, no, because K is proportional to (M2) / (M1 + M2). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the mass function.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the velocities of the two stars in a binary system is inversely proportional to their masses. So if K1 and K2 are the velocities of the two stars, then M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because the more massive star moves slower. So in system_1, K1 is 10
