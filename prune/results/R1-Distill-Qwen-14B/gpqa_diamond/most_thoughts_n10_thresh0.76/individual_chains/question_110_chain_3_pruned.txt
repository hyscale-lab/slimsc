Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different brightness limits. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can only go up to 16. So a star must be brighter than 17 mag to be observable by ESPRESSO? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased is that "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh right, because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter (lower magnitude), it's better. So ESPRESSO can see stars down to 17 mag, and HIRES can see down to 16 mag. So any star that is brighter than 17 (i.e., magnitude less than 17) can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V less than 16.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: the apparent magnitude is what's measured from Earth. So, if a star has an apparent V magnitude, say, 15, both can see it. But if a star is fainter than 16 mag, like 17, only ESPRESSO can. But if it's fainter than 17, like 18, neither can. So, for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 and less than 16? Wait, no. Because HIRES can only go up to 16, so if a star is brighter than 16 (i.e., V <16), then both can observe it. Star must be brighter than or equal to the lower limit of both? Hmm.

Wait, no, I think I got it wrong. The question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's apparent V is brighter than 17, which means V <17. So for ESPRESSO,
