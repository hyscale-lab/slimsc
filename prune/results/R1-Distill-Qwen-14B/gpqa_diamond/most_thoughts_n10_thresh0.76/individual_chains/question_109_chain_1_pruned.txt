Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. The system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on the given conditions. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Pauli statistics require certain quantum numbers to satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, I'll need to find the possible values of S and L for the NN system after emission.

The initial state is 1S0. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 means S=0 because (2*0+1)=1. L must be 0 because S0 refers to the orbital angular momentum. And J would be 0 since S=0 and L=0, so J=0. So the initial NN state is S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X. Let's denote the particle's quantum numbers. The intrinsic parity of X is -1. Intrinsic parity is a property of particles; for example, bosons like photons have parity -1. But wait, particles can have different parities based on their type. Maybe X is a pion or something similar.

Now, when the system emits X, the total state must conserve angular momentum and parity. So, let's model this as an initial state (1S0) that decays into the final NN state plus X.

Wait, no. Wait, the system is the two nucleons in the initial 1S0 state. When they emit a particle X, the final state is the NN in some state and the particle X. So the initial state is NN in 1S0. The final state is NN in some state (with T=0) and X.

Wait, the problem says the initial state is 1S0, and the particle X is emitted. So the process is NN(1S0) â†’ NN' (some state) + X.

So, the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0
