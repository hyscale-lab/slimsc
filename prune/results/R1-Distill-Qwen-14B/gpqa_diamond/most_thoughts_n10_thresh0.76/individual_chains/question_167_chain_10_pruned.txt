Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I need to understand the problem. The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). The non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated using the relative entropy measure, which is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5. The options are A to D with numbers and zero.

Wait, so I remember that for Gaussian states, the density matrix has a certain form, like the thermal state or coherent state. But for a Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the state is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity would measure how non-Gaussian the state is compared to a Gaussian reference.

Relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (del_b) is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and that of the reference Gaussian state. So to compute this, I need to find rho and tau, then compute their entropies and subtract.

But wait, how to get rho and tau? Let's think.

The given state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. When I take the outer product, the density matrix rho will be |psi><psi|.

But for the reference Gaussian state tau, I think it's the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in some sense. Maybe the minimum distance Gaussian? Or perhaps, tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho? I'm not exactly sure, but maybe for a cat state, the Gaussian reference is a coherent state or a squeezed state?

Wait, another approach: I remember that for a superposition state like a Schrödinger cat, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated by comparing it to the maximum entropy Gaussian state, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the completely mixed Gaussian state? Or perhaps it's the Gaussian state that has the same first moments as the state in question. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but another point: The state |alpha> is a coherent state, which is Gaussian. A superposition of two coherent states, like in |psi>, is a non-Gaussian state because coherent states are orthogonal when alpha is real and non-zero. So, when you have |alpha> and |-alpha> as orthogonal states, the state |psi> is a superposition of two orthogonal states, which would create a Wigner negativity, hence non-Gaussian.

But how do I compute the relative entropy for this?

Let me think about the steps:

1. Compute the density matrix rho for the given state |psi>.
2. Find the reference Gaussian state tau, which is the Gaussian state closest to rho in terms of relative entropy.
3. Compute the von Neumann
