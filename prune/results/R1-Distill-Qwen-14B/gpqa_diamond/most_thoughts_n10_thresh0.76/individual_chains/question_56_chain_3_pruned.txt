Okay, so I've got this question here about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the correct route and the corresponding probability.

Wait, dipole transitions... right, in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons. And for dipole transitions, certain selection rules apply. I remember the selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.

So the selection rules are usually: Δn = ±1, Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. But wait, for the hydrogen atom in non-relativistic theory, the main selection rules for dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, but wait, wait, in the case of the s orbital (l=0), the selection rules might be a bit different. Because when l is 0, the next possible l is 1, so Δl=±1. So from l=0 in n=3, the electron can transition to l=1 in n=2 or n=4. But since we're going to n=1, which is lower, I think it can only go to n=2 first.

Wait, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. So the first transition must be to a state where l=1 because l can only change by ±1. So the first step must go to l=1 in a lower n, or higher n. But since the final state is n=1, the initial state is n=3, so the first transition probably goes to n=2, l=1.

Wait, but wait, can l be anything else? Let me think. The initial state is 3,0,0. So possible transitions would have l=1 in either n=2 or n=4, but n can't jump more than ±1, I think? Or wait, the selection rule for Δn is not necessarily ±1. Oh wait, no, for dipole transitions, the rule is that Δn can be any integer except zero, but for hydrogen, the possible transitions are more constrained because of the energy levels. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait
