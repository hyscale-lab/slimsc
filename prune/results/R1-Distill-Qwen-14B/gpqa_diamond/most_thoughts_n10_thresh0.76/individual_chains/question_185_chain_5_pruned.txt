Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, I remember that Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each component of σ, like σx, σy, σz, are the Pauli matrices. The dot product σ · n would be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. Oh right, and since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

The Hamiltonian H is then this combination multiplied by ε. So H is ε times (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz).

I need to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Alternatively, since σ · n is a vector in the Bloch sphere direction, maybe I can think about the eigenstates in that direction.

Wait, what's the general form of eigenvalues for a spin operator in a particular direction? Oh right, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2 when the operator is proportional to the Pauli matrices. But wait, the Hamiltonian here is H = ε σ · n. 

Hmm, so the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2, I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ, right? So S · n would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So if H is ε times (σ · n), that would make the eigenvalues ± ε * 1, because the σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because σ · n is a matrix, and for any unit vector n, its eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the trace of σ · n would be zero (since the eigenvalues are +1 and -1), and the determinant would be -1*(1) - 0 = -1? No, wait, the determinant of σ · n. Let me think: σ · n is a 2x2 matrix, and its trace is 0, determinant is -1, because (σ · n)^2 is identity matrix? Wait,
