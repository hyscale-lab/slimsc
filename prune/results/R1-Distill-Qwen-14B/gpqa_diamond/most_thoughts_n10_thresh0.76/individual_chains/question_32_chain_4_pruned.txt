Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is given as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A would be protons plus neutrons, which is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's Li-6, I think.

So the problem is about calculating the kinetic energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. Wait, but wait, in particle accelerators, the energy usually refers to the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Wait, but sometimes they might specifically ask for kinetic energy. I need to be careful here.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think they're asking for the total energy, which would be gamma multiplied by the rest energy. Because the rest energy is mc², and the total energy is gamma * mc².

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest energy to get the total energy.

First, the mass of Li-6. I think the atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol. But wait, that's the molar mass. The mass of a single Li-6 nucleus would be approximately its atomic mass in atomic mass units (u).

Wait, Li-6's molar mass is about 6.941 g/mol, but each nucleus is about 6.941 / Avogadro's number grams. But wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is known. Alternatively, I can get the exact mass from standard data. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units.

Wait, I remember that the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass would be 3*(1
