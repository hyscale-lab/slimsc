Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chiralityâ€”so it has a stereocenter or maybe some kind of other asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Okay, this is an alkene with a substituent on each carbon. The (Z) configuration means the higher priority groups are on the same side. But wait, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3. The molecule is 1-chloro, so the chlorine is on the first carbon. The first carbon is attached to Cl, the double bond, and two methyl groups (since the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C1 is CH2Cl attached to C2). Wait, no, wait. The structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, a double bond to C2, and two other substituents. Wait, but wait, the formula for but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3
