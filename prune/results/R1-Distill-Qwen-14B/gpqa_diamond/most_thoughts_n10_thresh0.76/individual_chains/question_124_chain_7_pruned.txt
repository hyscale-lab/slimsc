Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll take it slow.

So, the question is about particles moving in a detector. These particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. The detector's radius is 30 meters. The initial setup says that with a Lorentz factor of about 20, on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the walls.

Hmm. Lorentz factor is gamma, right? And gamma is equal to 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the problem is about the fraction that reach the detector's walls. So I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime or how fast they move before decaying.

Wait, since the particles are fast-decaying, I remember that their decay length is important here. The decay length is how far they travel before decaying, which depends on their lifetime, velocity, and gamma factor. Oh right, because the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by gamma. So the decay length L is v multiplied by gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime tau: L = v * gamma * tau.

But in this problem, I think the proper lifetime is the same for all particles. So the key is the product of gamma and v. Wait, but gamma is dependent on velocity. So if the velocity increases, gamma increases, but v itself also increases. Hmm, but the problem says the particles are traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities. So maybe v is very close to c, so we can approximate v ≈ c.

If that's the case, then the decay length L ≈ c * gamma * tau. So the decay length is proportional to gamma. Because c and tau are constants for all particles, the decay length just depends on gamma.

Now, the detector has a radius of 30 meters. So if the particles decay before reaching the wall, they won't be detected. Wait, no, the problem says the particles reach the inner walls. So the ones that reach the walls are the ones that don't decay before traveling that distance. So the decay length must be longer than the radius of the detector for a particle to reach the wall.

Wait, no, wait. Because the particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel without decaying is the
