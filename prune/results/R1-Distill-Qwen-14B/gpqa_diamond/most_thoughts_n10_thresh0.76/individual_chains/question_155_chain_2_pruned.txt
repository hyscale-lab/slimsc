Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

Alright, so the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. The state is given as a column vector, and I need to compute ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of P_z in that state.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, I'll have to find ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then plug them into this formula.

The matrix forms of P_x, P_y, and P_z are given. Let me note those down.

P_x matrix:
Row 1: [0, ħ/√2, 0]
Row 2: [ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2]
Row 3: [0, ħ/√2, 0]

P_y matrix:
Row 1: [0, -iħ/√2, 0]
Row 2: [iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2]
Row 3: [0, iħ/√2, 0]

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because the matrices are given in this basis.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩.

Wait, no, more accurately, the state vector is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, in the P_z basis, the state is already expressed.

Now, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, I can confirm that. But perhaps that's not directly relevant for calculating ΔP_z, but maybe I should just proceed.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute the expectation value of P_z in the state |ψ⟩.

The expectation value ⟨A⟩ is given by ψ† A ψ, where ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is the row vector (conjugate transpose, but in this case, the components are real except for P_y, but since our state is a real vector, perhaps it doesn't matter. Wait, the state is real, so ψ† is just the transpose.

Let me compute ⟨P_z⟩ first. So, I need to calculate ψ† P_z ψ.

Given that ψ is a column vector [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

So, let me write out the matrix multiplication.

P_z ψ will be:

First element:
(ħ)(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ/2.

Second element:
0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = 0.

Third element:
0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (-ħ)(-1/2) = ħ/2.

So, P_z ψ is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, ψ† times P_z ψ is the dot product of ψ and P_z ψ.

So, (ψ†) (P_z ψ) = (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-1/2)*(-ħ/2) = ħ/4.

Second term: (1/√2)*0 = 0.

Third term: (-1/2)*(ħ/2) = -ħ/4.

Adding them up: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Because ΔP_z² equals ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩². Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, ΔP_z² is just ⟨P_z²⟩.

So, I need to compute ψ† P_z² ψ.

But wait, P_z squared is P_z multiplied by itself.

Let me find P_z^2. Since P_z is a diagonal matrix, squaring it is easy: each element is squared.
