Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out. Hmm, it's about planets orbiting a star and their orbital periods. The question is asking about the maximum orbital period of a second planet that would exhibit both transit and occultation events. 

Alright, let me break down the information given. There's a star with a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. So the star is bigger than the Sun. Then, there's a first planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit. Its transit impact parameter is 0.2, and it has an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet has 2.5 Earth radii and we need to find its maximum period so that it transits and occults. Both planets are in the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Wait, transit and occultation events. I remember that a transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked, which is harder to detect but can happen if the planet emits some light or if we can measure the change in brightness when it's behind the star.

But more importantly, both events require that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits (so the impact parameter must be small enough) and that the orbital period is such that both events are observable.

Wait, but the first planet is already transiting. The second planet must also transit, but how does that affect its period? Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The question is about the second planet. For it to transit, the orbital period must be such that its orbit aligns with our line of sight.

Wait, no. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another thought: For a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on enough such that the planet passes in front of the star. The transit impact parameter is the measure of how far the planet's path is from the star's center. If the impact parameter is zero, the planet passes directly in front of the center. For a transit to happen, the impact parameter must be less than the sum of the planet's radius and the star's radius, but wait, actually, the impact parameter is the distance from the star's center to the planet's path. So if the impact parameter is less than (R_star - R_planet), then the planet will transit. Hmm, or wait, maybe the impact parameter is measured as the closest approach when the planet's path is aligned. Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts.

Wait, maybe I should recall that the transit occurs when the planet's orbit is such that it passes in front of the star. The transit depth depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's. The impact parameter is the distance of the center of the planet's path from the center of the star, measured in units of the star's radius. So if the impact parameter is zero, the planet passes directly over the center. If it's larger than 1, the planet doesn't transit.

So, for a transit to occur, the planet's orbital plane must be aligned such that its path brings it in front of the star. The impact parameter for the first planet is 0.2,
