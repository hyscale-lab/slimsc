Okay, so I'm looking at this NMR question, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that we have a mixture of two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 ratio. The molecular formula of each is C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm, each integrating for 1:1. Then, there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, integrating in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, so the aromatic region is showing two singlets, each integrating for the same amount. Since each compound contributes to the aromatic protons, perhaps each has a certain symmetry that results in a singlet.

The other part is the three signals at 2.2 ppm, all singlets. That's probably the methyl groups attached to something, maybe the benzene rings. The integration is 2:1:1, meaning the first peak is twice as big as the other two, but wait, no. Wait, the question says 2:1:1. So in the NMR, the areas are in 2:1:1. So the three signals correspond to different types of methyl groups, but in a 2:1:1 ratio. Wait, but each compound contributes their own methyl groups. So maybe each compound has a certain number of methyl groups, and when mixed 1:1, the total signals split into three different types.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think about the possible structures. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene or a diethyl substituted benzene.

Looking at the options, the compounds provided are:
1) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene
2) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
3) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
4) 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Wait, options are A, B, C, D. Let's check the options given.

Options:
A) 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5
B) 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4
