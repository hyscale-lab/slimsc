Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. The system's state is given, and the observable is represented by a matrix operator P.

Alright, the state vector is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? Oh wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization. So maybe I should check if this state is normalized or not. Because if it's not, I'll have to normalize it before proceeding. Let me calculate the norm.

The state vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized. So I should probably normalize it first. The normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1], right? Wait, but the problem might be treating the state as given, maybe not normalized. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually assumed to be normalized. So I think I should proceed by normalizing it.

So the state vector |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. 

Now, the observable is P. The matrix P is given. Let me write it out. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, this looks like a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, that's an interesting matrix. It seems symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which makes sense because observables are represented by Hermitian operators. So P is definitely an observable.

The problem is to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. So in quantum
