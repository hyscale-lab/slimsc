Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see. The question is asking which of the given exoplanets has the highest density. The options are a through d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of the options.

First, I need to remember what factors determine the density of a planet. Density is mass divided by volume, right? So, density = mass/volume. For planets, the volume depends on the radius. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if a planet's radius increases, its volume increases by the cube of the radius. 

Looking at each option:

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. That would have the same density as Earth, I guess. Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³, I remember that. So a's density is 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, isn't that the same as Earth's density? Because if mass is 2 Earth masses but density is 5.5, then volume is mass over density. Wait, but the question says it has a density of 5.5, so that's the same as Earth. So how does that compare?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the planet has 2 Earth masses. So if density is 5.5, which is Earth's, then the volume would be (2 M_earth) / 5.5. But Earth's volume is (M_earth / 5.5). So this planet's volume is twice Earth's? No, wait, because density is mass over volume. So for Earth: 5.5 = M / V. So V = M /5.5.

For option b: 5.5 = (2M) / V'. So V' = 2M /5.5. So V' is 2 times Earth's volume. So the radius would be larger because volume scales with r³. So the radius of this planet would be cube root of (2) times Earth's radius. So about 1.26 times Earth's radius. But wait, the question is about which has the highest density. If all options have different masses and radii, I need to compute each's density.

Wait, but option b says the planet has a density
