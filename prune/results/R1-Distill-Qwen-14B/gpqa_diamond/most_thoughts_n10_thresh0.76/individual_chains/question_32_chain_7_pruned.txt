Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons add up to 6 nucleons.

So, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy; it's more because of the gamma factor. The formula I think is E = gamma * m0c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

The speed given is 0.96c. So let me compute gamma first. Let me plug in v=0.96c into the formula. So v² is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, wait, sqrt(0.0784) is about 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate that more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784):

Wait, 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784 exactly. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me do that. So 0.96 squared is 0.9216, right. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857 approximately. So that's about 3.5714.

But wait, maybe I should compute this more accurately. Let me think: 0.96 is 24/25, so v=24c/25. So v^2 = (24/25)^2 c² = 576/625 c². So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 576/625 = (625-576)/625 = 49/625. So sqrt(49/625) is 7/25 = 0.28, so yes, gamma is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So gamma is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857. So, okay.

Now, the problem is about the energy of the nucleus. So we need to find the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. But wait, what's the rest mass of the nucleus X, which is Li-6? I think I need to find the mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units (amu) first, then convert that to energy.

Wait, but wait—wait a minute. The nucleus is moving at 0.96c, so its relativistic energy is gamma * m * c². So I need to find m, the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li has atomic number Z=3. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 amu, and a neutron is about 1.008665 amu. So the total mass of Li-6 is 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = let's calculate that.

3*(1.007276) = 3.021828 amu.
3*(1.008665) = 3.025995 amu.
Adding them together: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 amu.

Wait, but wait, wait. The actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy. But wait, in this case, when calculating the rest mass energy, maybe I should use the exact mass of the nucleus as if it's a free particle. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleons' masses, but that might not be accurate. Hmm, but wait, in reality, the mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to the mass defect (binding energy). But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps they just want me to use the sum of the individual masses. Or maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, but I don't have exact mass here. Let me think: the problem is about the energy of the collider. So the energy required would be the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, the total energy is gamma * m c², which includes the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy (gamma-1) mc². But in the context of a collider, the energy typically refers to the kinetic energy. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the energy here probably refers to the total energy (gamma m c²), but sometimes colliders are described in terms of their kinetic energy. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Or perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic.

Wait, let me check. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) acceler
