Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, what exactly does that mean?

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think I should write this out in matrix form to get a better idea. Let me recall that |0⟩ is the vector [1, 0] and |1⟩ is [0, 1]. So when I compute each term, |0⟩⟨0| would be a matrix with 1s in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is a matrix with 1 in the bottom-right corner and zeros elsewhere.

So adding these two matrices together gives a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are both 1, and the off-diagonal are zero. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So the density matrix ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Is that right? I think so.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that qubit states can be visualized on the Bloch sphere. Each qubit state |ψ⟩ can be represented as a point on the surface of this sphere. But wait, this is a density matrix, not a pure state. So how does that translate?

Density matrices for mixed states are more complicated. But wait, this particular ρ looks familiar. Let me think: when a density matrix is a classical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability, that should correspond to a completely mixed state. Because if you have equal probability, the state can't be distinguished from a classical coin flip. 

In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface. The completely mixed state, which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit, is at the origin, right? Because the origin is the completely mixed state, which has no coherence and equal probabilities for all possible states.

Wait, how does the Bloch vector relate to the density
