Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms.

I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula I recall for interplanar distance d_hkl is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h sum terms involving cosines of angles) )... Wait, no, that might not be right. Oh wait, for a cubic system, it's simpler, but rhombohedral is a bit different.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) (cos α + cos β + cos gamma) )) but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Or perhaps for a rhombohedral system, it's a bit more specialized.

Another approach: The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be found using the general formula for interplanar spacing in terms of lattice parameters. I think the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), assuming all angles are equal. Wait, no, maybe not exactly.

Wait, I should probably look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't do that. Let me think. In a rhombohedral system, all the edges are the same length 'a', and all angles are equal, let's say theta. So, the structure factor isn't cubic but rhombohedral. The interplanar distance formula is more complex.

I think the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hk + hk) * cos(theta) )? No, wait, maybe it's (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hk cos gamma + hk cos gamma), but that doesn't seem right either. Because each angle would contribute to each pair. Wait, maybe for a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) / (h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hk + hl) cos(theta) + ... wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Miller indices.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is given by:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) [1 - 2 cos(theta) (cos h + cos k + cos l) ) ]

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, I recall that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Since in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so theta is 30 degrees.

Wait, no, I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d^2 = ( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) ) + ( 2 hk cos γ )/(a b) + ( 2 hl cos β )/(a c) + ( 2 kl cos α )/(b c) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ = theta. So substituting those, the formula simplifies.

Let
