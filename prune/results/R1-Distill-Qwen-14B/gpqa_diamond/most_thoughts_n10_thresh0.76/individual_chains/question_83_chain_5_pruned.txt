Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I think I should figure out the concentrations after dilution and then calculate the pH at different stages during the titration.

Alright, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react in a neutralization reaction. The general formula for their reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the first part is about dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Let me calculate the new concentration.

Dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1 + V2).

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 20 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / (20 + 20) = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.05 * 20 is 1, and the denominator is 40, so 1/40 is 0.025 M. Right, so the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's find the equivalence point because that will help in the second part of the question.

Equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid = M * V (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 mol.

So, moles of NaOH needed at equivalence point is also 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence volume? Wait, wait. No, 25% of the titration usually refers to the point where 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So for the equivalence point being 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Alternatively, sometimes 25% titration refers to 25% of the initial acid has been neutralized. Let me think: equivalence point requires all the acid to be neutralized. So 25% titration would mean 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So yes, 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but let's re-verify. The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. Moles of NaOH
