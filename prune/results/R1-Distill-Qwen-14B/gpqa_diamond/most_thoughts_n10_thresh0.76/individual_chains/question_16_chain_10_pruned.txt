Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So, the compounds need to have a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry.

Let me go through each compound one by one. 

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Wait, the structure here is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No wait, butene is four carbons. Wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is a double bond from C1 to C2. So the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3? Wait, but 2-methyl? Oh wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituents on C1 would be Cl, a double bond to C2, and another group. Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be a CH(CH3) group on C2. Wait, no, but
