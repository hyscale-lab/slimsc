Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are five exoplanets in a system, and they were discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, I remember. Those methods are used to detect planets by looking at the variations in the timing of a planet's transit across the star's disk, but I don't think the method affects the way we calculate their temperatures here.

The planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet has a period that's a multiple of Planet_1's. Let me note that down. So,

- Planet_1: P1 = P (let's say P is the base period)
- Planet_2: P2 = 2P
- Planet_3: P3 = 2.5P
- Planet_4: P4 = 3.5P
- Planet_5: P5 = 5P

So the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. They have the same albedo, which is the fraction of light reflected. Since albedo is the same, it won't affect the ratio. So the only thing that matters is their distance from the star, which affects their equilibrium temperature.

I remember the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet. The formula is:

T = T_star * ( ( L / (16πσ) ) )^1/4 * ( ( R_star ) / (2a) ) )^0.5

Wait, I think another way to write it is based on the inverse square law and the fourth power for the blackbody radiation. The equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) ) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e ) )^0.25

Wait, but in this case, the albedo (A) is the same for both planets, so A cancels out. Also, the eccentricity e is probably negligible or the same for both, but the question doesn't specify, so I think we can assume e is zero or same for both, so we can ignore it for the ratio.

But wait, I think the formula is often approximated as:

T = T_eff * ( ( L / (16πσ) ) )^1/4 * ( ( R ) / (2a) )^0.5 )

Wait, maybe I should think more carefully. The equilibrium temperature formula is based on the balance between absorbed stellar radiation and emitted thermal radiation.

The formula I recall is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) )

Wait, is that right? Because the star emits flux F = σ*T_star^4 * (L / (4π R_star^2)) ), right? So the flux at the planet's distance is F = L/(4π a²), where a is the planet's orbital distance. Then the planet absorbs (1 - A) * F * π R_planet² (since the cross-section is π R_p²), and emits as a black
