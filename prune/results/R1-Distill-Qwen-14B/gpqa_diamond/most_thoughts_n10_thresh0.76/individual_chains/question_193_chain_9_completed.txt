Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D with different powers of r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on these concepts. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, because parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs, so plx = 1/r. So if the distance r increases, the parallax decreases, and vice versa.

The problem says number varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, I get N ∝ (r)^5. Because 1/(1/r)^5 is r^5.

Wait, wait. But the question isn't directly about N as a function of r. It's about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, I think that refers to the density of stars as a function of distance. Or maybe the differential number of stars per unit distance. So perhaps they want dN/dr, the rate of change of number with distance.

Right, because if you have a certain number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr, the number would depend on r^5. But to find how N changes with r, you take the derivative.

Let me think: N is proportional to r^5. So dN/dr is 5*r^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 as you go further out. But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the functional form of N as a function of r, not the derivative. Because the question states "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Maybe it's the number per unit distance, so the density. So if N ∝ r^5, then per unit distance, it's N/(dr) which would be r^4. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for how N itself varies with r, not the derivative. Wait, let me reread the question. It says "the number of stars ... varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, so N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but that would mean as r increases, the number of stars increases, which seems counterintuitive. Because at greater distances, you can see more stars? But in reality, the number of stars you see at a larger distance isn't necessarily higher for a fixed region. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is talking about the number of stars observed in a specific region, but that depends on how the density of stars changes with distance. Alternatively, maybe it's a mathematical relationship without considering the actual physical limitations.

So the given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, N = k * r^5, where k is the proportionality constant. So as r increases, N increases as r^5.

But the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps they're asking for the rate of change of N with r, which is dN/dr. So dN/dr would be 5k r^4. So the change in N per unit r is proportional to r^4.

Looking back at the options, option C says ~ r^4, so that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think in terms of flux or density. The number of stars you observe depends on how many are in a volume. The number density (stars per unit volume) would be a factor, and the volume at a distance r with a thin shell dr would be 4πr² dr. But in this problem, they're using a specific region, which might have a fixed solid angle, so it's more about the number per distance.

Alternatively, maybe the given relation is already an observed relation, and regardless of physical reasoning, we just need to translate plx to r and find how N depends on r.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r, so N ∝ r^5. So if we plot N against r, it's a r^5 curve. But the question is about how it changes with distance per unit distance. So the change in N when r changes by a small amount dr would be dN = (dN/dr) dr. So dN/dr is 5 N_0 r^4, where N_0 is the constant of proportionality.

So the change in N per unit change in r is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but why would the number of stars increase with r^5? That seems odd because at larger distances, each shell's volume is larger, but the number of stars in that shell depends on the density. Maybe in this case, the density of stars is such that it's causing N to increase. But perhaps that's beyond the scope here; the question is purely mathematical.

So putting it all together, the number of stars varies as r^5, and the change per unit r is r^4. So the answer is C.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the given relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance per unit range as \( r^4 \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
