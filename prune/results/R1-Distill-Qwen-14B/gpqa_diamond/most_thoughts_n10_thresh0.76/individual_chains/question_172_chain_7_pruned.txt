Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, the stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the populations of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Right, where n_i is the number of particles in state i, g_i is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, the ratio of their populations (for the excited state) is 2. Let's say E is the energy difference. Let's denote star_1 as state 1 and star_2 as state 2.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's the E in the equation. So E_i - E_j is 1.38e-23 J.

But wait, both stars are in LTE, so each has its own temperature. So for each star, we can write a Boltzmann factor. Let me think about how the excitation relates to the temperatures.

Wait, perhaps the problem is comparing the excitation of the same energy level in two stars at different temperatures. Oh, wait, no, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the ratio of their populations is 2.

Wait, maybe I should model it as for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. But the question says the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or wait, no: the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, for a given energy level, the
