Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question gives me a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So substituting: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So it's (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2. Let me compute that: (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? Oh wait, that can't be right. Oh wait no, I think I missed something. No, the formula is correct. Wait, another way: for each degree, one ring or double bond. So 4.5 is not possible, so maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

The correct formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X is zero. So 2*8 +2 = 18. 18 -9 =9. 9 +1 (because N is +1?) Wait, no, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So the N is considered as a part of the structure. Wait, no, in the formula, X stands for halogens, which aren't present here. So:

DoU = (2*8 + 2 - 9 +1)/2. Because N is +1. So 18-9=9, +1=10. 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. So that could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) plus a double bond and a ring or another double bond? Or a benzene ring plus a carbonyl group?

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm as a triplet for 1H. That's quite upfield for an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Oh, but wait, sometimes they can be downfield as well. Alternatively, amines or something else, but more likely an aldehyde. So maybe the triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. But wait, in an aldehyde, the proton is usually on a CH, so maybe adjacent to a CH2 group
