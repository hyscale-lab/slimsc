Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about two electrons in p orbitals. They're ignoring spin angular momentum, so I can focus just on the orbital part. The state they're in is given as |1,1,2,-1>. From what I remember, the first two numbers are the individual l values (l1 and l2), then l is the total angular momentum, and m is the projection along the z-axis. Oh right, so each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 and l2, which are 1 each since they're p orbitals.

Wait, so the total orbital angular momentum quantum number L is given as 2. Because when you couple two angular momenta l1 and l2, the possible total L values go from |l1 - l2| up to l1 + l2. Since l1 and l2 are both 1, the maximum is 2, so L can be 0, 1, or 2. In this case, the state is |1,1,2,-1>, so L is 2 and M is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. So they want the probability that both measurements give -ħ. Hmm.

Wait, L1z and L2z are the z-components of the individual orbital angular momenta. Since each orbital angular momentum has quantum number l=1, the possible m values for each would be -1, 0, +1. So each L1z and L2z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. Because m is in units of ħ, so mħ.

In the state |1,1,2,-1>, which is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum L² and L_z (the z-component of the total angular momentum). But we're being asked about the joint probability of each electron's individual L_z being -ħ. So each L1z and L2z would need to be measured as -ħ. So the product would be (-ħ) * (-ħ) = ħ²? Wait, no, the question just wants both to be -ħ. So the question is, what's the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both are -ħ each.

But wait, the system is in a state that's a combination of all possible states of L1z and L2z that add up to the total M of -1. Because the total M is the sum of the individual m's. So M = m1 + m2. In this case, M is -1.

So the total state is a combination of all possible (m1, m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = -1. Each electron's m can be -1, 0, +1.

Let me list all the possible (m1, m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible m1 and m2:

(-1, 0): because (-1) + 0 = -1.

(0, -1): 0 + (-1) = -1.

Wait
