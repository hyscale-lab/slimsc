Okay, so I have this question about the redshift of objects detected by optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through what I remember.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, redshift and wavelength... I remember that when a source is moving away, the wavelength of the light we receive is stretched, right? So the redshift z is (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength.

The Lyman alpha line is emitted at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. But when it's absorbed by a cloud, that same wavelength is shifted. The quasar emits light, and some of it is absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So we observe the absorption line at a longer wavelength, depending on the redshift.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the clouds must be at a redshift where the absorbed light is still in the optical range detectable by ground telescopes. Because, if the redshift is too high, the wavelength might move into the infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't see as effectively, or maybe they can't observe it at all with optical instruments.

Wait, optical telescopes operate in the visible spectrum, which is roughly 400-700 nm. But wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far ultraviolet. So when the cloud is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength is λ = 1216 * (1 + z) Angstroms.

We need this observed wavelength to be in the optical range. So λ_obs must be less than 700 nm, but wait, no. Wait, no, because higher redshift means longer wavelength. So if the observed wavelength is in the optical (visible), that's 400-700 nm, but wait, that's 4000-7000 Angstroms.

Wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, and 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So for the Lyman alpha to be observed in the optical, the observed wavelength must be between 4000 and 7000 Angstroms.

So, set up the equation: 1216*(1 + z) = wavelength in Angstroms.

We need 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms for the wavelength to be in the optical range. Because if it's lower than 4000, it's ultraviolet, which ground telescopes can't see (since the atmosphere blocks UV). So the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is just at 4000 Angstroms.

So solving for z: 1 + z = 4000 / 1216.

Calculating that: 4000 divided by 1216. Let me compute that. 1216 * 3 is 3648, which is less than 4000. 1216 * 3.29 is approx: 1200 *3.3 is 3960, so 3.3 would give about 3996 (since 1216*3=3648, 1216*0.3=364.8, so 3+0.3=3.3 gives 3648+364.8=3990+?). Hmm, maybe approximately 3.293.

So 4000/1216 ≈ 3.293.

So 1 + z = 3.293 → z ≈ 2.293.

Wait, but wait: ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths shorter than about 3000 Angstroms (300 nm, which is near UV). Wait, no. Actually, the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV, so ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm (which is 3000 Angstroms). So if the observed wavelength is longer than that, it's in the visible range.

Wait, no: longer wavelength is lower energy. So if the Lyman-alpha is at 1216 Angstroms, and redshifted by a factor (1+z), we need the observed wavelength to be longer than 3000 Angstroms to be in the optical (since shorter than that is UV, which we can't see from ground). So the condition is 1216*(1+z) > 3000 Angstroms.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because if the observed wavelength is longer than 3000 Angstroms, it's in the visible or near-infrared. But optical telescopes can detect it. So let's recalculate.

So 1216*(1+z) > 3000 → 1 + z > 3000 / 1216.

Compute 3000 ÷ 1216: 1216 * 2 = 2432. 3000-2432=568. 568/1216 ≈ 0.466. So 3000/1216 ≈ 2.466. So 1 + z > 2.466 → z > 1.466.

Wait, so z must be larger than approximately 1.466 for the observed wavelength to be in the optical. The question is about the lower limit, so the minimum redshift would be just above 1.466. Looking at the options, the choices are B)1.2, D)1.9, and C)2.4.

Wait, wait—no. Because if the cloud is at a redshift z, then the quasar must be at a higher redshift. Because the quasar's light passes through the cloud, which is between us and the quasar. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. Wait, but the question is about the cloud's redshift. Hmm, but maybe I don't need to get into that. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud, such that the absorption line is in the optical.

But wait, wait a second. If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the quasar must be at a higher redshift, say z_q, where z_q > z. So the quasar's light is redshifted by z_q, but the absorption is due to the cloud's hydrogen, so the absorption line is at (z_cloud + 1) * 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, perhaps not. Because the cloud is at redshift z_cloud. The quasar is at z_quasar > z_cloud. So the quasar's emitted light is at a rest frame wavelength of
