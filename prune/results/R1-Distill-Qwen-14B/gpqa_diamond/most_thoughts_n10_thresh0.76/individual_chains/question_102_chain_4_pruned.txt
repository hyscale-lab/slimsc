Okay, so I have this pretty complicated question here about molecular biology techniques, specifically involving transgenic constructs and protein expression. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

So the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and they're studying their developmental fate. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So the vector has two ORFs, one for the ligand and one for the receptor.

Looking at the vector's structure: the ligand ORF is at the 5' position and is fused to mCherry. Then, between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Oh wait, I remember that loxP sites are used in Cre/Lox recombination. So if Cre is present, the lox sites get cut, and the stop cassette is removed. That would allow the downstream gene to be expressed.

The receptor is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP. But there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. Wait, lox2272 is a variant of loxP, I think. So similar to loxP, but maybe different enough that Cre doesn't cut them unless perhaps a different Cre variant is used? Or maybe it's another system, but I'm not too sure.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA stands for chicken beta-actin; it's a strong promoter used for expression. The receptor is under the control of IRES. IRES elements are Internal Ribosome Entry Sites, which allow for the translation of a second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA. So, the ligand is under CBA and the receptor is under IRES. So the idea is that the same mRNA would drive expression of both ligand and receptor.

They've also made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They tested expression on a Western blot after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes. The blot uses actin as a loading control, which makes sense because actin is a common housekeeping gene.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct, in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, right? So the Cre is probably under the control of SOX10, meaning it's active in neural crest-derived cells. When they do this cross, the Cre will excise the lox sites.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They expected to see a green signal, which would come from the eGFP. But they don't. So why?

The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship
B) receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi
C) enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing
D) receptor and eGFP are not in the frame

Hmm. Let me think.

The setup uses a bicistronic vector where both ligand and receptor are under the same promoter, with the receptor being expressed via IRES. The ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed first, and the receptor is expressed via IRES, which allows for the translation of the second ORF. But wait, in the vector, the ligand is at the 5' end, and the receptor at the 3'. So the mRNA is ligand followed by IRES, then receptor. Wait, no. The IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the structure should be: CBA promoter, ligand ORF, then IRES, then receptor ORF.

Wait, no, that's not possible because IRES allows for the translation of the second protein. So the mRNA would
