Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a multiple-choice question about synthesis pathways, which I find a bit tricky but interesting. Let's see. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions starting from benzene.

First, I'll try to draw the structure of the target compound. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering starts at the ethoxy group as position 1. Then, position 2 is the tert-butyl group, and position 3 is the nitro group. So the substituents are at the ortho and meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, another way: the numbering might be such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So that would be positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the substituents are adjacent to each other, like 1 and 2 are next to each other, and 3 is adjacent to 2. Hmm, maybe it's 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), which would make the substituents in a sort of 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Now, the problem is about the order of reactions. Each step is a substitution or nitration or something similar.

The substituents we're adding are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The positions of these substituents will depend on the directing effects of each group and the order in which they're introduced.

I remember that nitro groups are meta-directing, while ethoxy (an ether) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl group is bulky, but it's an alkyl group, so it's activating and ortho/para-directing as well.

Wait, but wait: tert-butyl is a strong activating group? No, wait, no. Alkyl groups are activating because they're electron-donating through sigma bonds. So they activate the ring for electrophilic substitution. So they
