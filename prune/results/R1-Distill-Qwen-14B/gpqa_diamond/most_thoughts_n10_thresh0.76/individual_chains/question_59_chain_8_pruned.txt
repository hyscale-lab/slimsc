Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me think through this step by step. Hmm, the problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, so maybe I should calculate the moles of each and see what's left after the reaction.

First, I'll calculate the moles of each component. Moles are calculated as concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). 

Starting with acetic acid: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But for the purpose of neutralization, I think I can consider it as a monoprotic acid, so each mole can donate one H+ ion.

Next, HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. So that's 0.08 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each formula unit gives two OH^- ions, right? So the moles of OH^- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix acids and bases, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. So I should find the total moles of H+ and OH- after mixing all the solutions.

Let me add up all the H+ sources. The acetic acid contributes 0.05 moles (but wait, since it's weak, maybe I should treat it differently? Or perhaps for neutralization, I can just sum the H+ available. Alternatively, wait, perhaps I should consider only the strong acids and strong bases first, then deal with the weak acid if any excess remains.)

Wait, maybe I should first calculate all the H+ and OH- from all sources, including the weak acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to treat the strong acids and strong bases first, then the weak acid.

Wait, another approach: when you mix all the solutions, the total volume will be 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

But first, let's look at the H+ and OH- contributions.

HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

The acetic acid, being a weak acid, will contribute H+ but not completely. However, when mixed with a strong base, the OH- will react with H+ from all sources, including the strong acid and the weak acid. Wait, but during neutralization, the strong acid will donate H+ completely, so perhaps the weak acid's H+ will dissociate as needed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that all available H+ and OH- will neutralize each other, and then see what's left.

Wait, but the problem is a mixture of an acid (acetic) and two others (HCl and Ba(OH)2). So perhaps first, I should calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, let me think. HCl is a strong acid, so 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH-.

So initially, H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. But wait, what
