Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me read it again carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, I think the formation of a cyanohydrin comes to mind. Oh right, the cyanohydrin reaction. So in that reaction, a ketone reacts with cyanide ions in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with both an alcohol and a nitrile group.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives the cyanohydrin. NaCN provides the CN- ions, and A must be an acid catalyst. Common acids used for such reactions include H3O+ (like from H2SO4 and H2O), or maybe something else. So A would be an acid, like H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3^- ions. I'm not sure if that's used in the cyanohydrin formation. I think the acid for the cyanohydrin is typically something like H2SO4, which would give H+ ions. So if A is H3O+, that would make sense for the first reaction.

Now the second reaction: the starting material is a nitrile (butanenitrile) with a hydroxy group, and it's reacting with B and water to form a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile is converting into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I recall that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Wait, in acidic conditions, nitriles are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. The reaction typically involves adding a strong acid, like HCl, and then heating. The mechanism is that the nitrile becomes an imidamide intermediate, then hydrolyzes to the amide, and further to the acid.

So reagent B should be an acid, like HCl. Because when the nitrile is treated with HCl and water, it hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid. Let me think about the reaction conditions. Oh right, sometimes H2SO4 is used as the acid, but in the options, the B reagents are either HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). 

Wait, looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option C as HCl. So if the correct B is HCl, then the options with B as HCl are A and C. But what about the other part?

Wait, the first reaction's A is an acid. If the first reaction uses H3O+ (as in options A and B), then for the second reaction, the B is HCl (so options A and C). But between A and C, option A has B as HCl and option C has B as HCl as well? Wait, no, looking again:

Options:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So the second reaction uses B and H2O. So B is the acid. So the correct reagent for the second step is HCl. So that would mean options A and C are possible. But in the first step, if option A is correct, where A is H3O+, then the first reaction would be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the first reaction. Are there other possibilities for reagent A? If A is NaHSO3, what's that about? NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Wait, but in the presence of a ketone and NaCN, what happens with NaHSO3?

Wait, I think the cyanohydrin formation requires an acid catalyst. NaHSO3 is an acid, but is it a suitable catalyst for this reaction? Let me think. I'm pretty sure that in the cyanohydrin formation, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is often used as the catalyst. So the reagent A would be H3O+ (which is provided by H2SO4, for example).

So the first reaction's A is H3O+, which is in options A and B. But the second reaction requires HCl for the hydrolysis. So looking at the options, which have A as H3O+ and B as HCl? Option A.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes, when you have a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group, as in the second starting material, perhaps the conditions for hydrolysis are different. Or maybe it's an intramolecular reaction. Let me think about the structure. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a four-carbon chain, with a nitrile on C2 and a hydroxyl also on C2, and a benzyl group attached.

So when it's treated with B and H2O, it becomes a butanoic acid. So the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid via hydrolysis.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic (HCl, H2O, heat) or basic (like NaOH, H2O, heat) conditions. Acidic gives the carboxylic acid directly, while basic gives the ammonium salt which is then acidified. But in the options, B is either HCl, acetic acid, etc.

So B should be an acid, like HCl. So in the options, the correct B is HCl, which is in options A and C. But the first reaction's A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

So if option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl, that would fit both reactions. Let me check the options again.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. So both reactions would use H3O+ and HCl. That seems plausible.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, NaHSO3 is used in the presence of other reagents. Wait, another reaction I remember is the hydrolysis of nitriles to ketones using a mixture like H2O and HgSO4 as a catalyst, but that's under acidic conditions. Maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is HCl. So in both reactions, reagent A and B would be H3O+ and HCl respectively. So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that would be the correct choice.

Wait, but is there any reason that HCl would not be the right reagent? I don't think so. So I'm leaning towards option A.

But wait, another possibility: what about the first reaction using NaHSO3? Let's think. If A were NaHSO3, then the reaction would be in a sulfurous acid environment. But I don't recall the cyanohydrin formation using NaHSO3 as a catalyst. It's usually H2SO4 (which is a stronger acid than HSO3^-).

So I think the correct reagents are H3O+ for A and HCl for B, which is option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, facilitating the nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (option A) is a suitable acid catalyst for this reaction, while NaHSO₃ (option C) is not commonly used for cyanohydrin formation.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This process typically requires an acidic environment, such as HCl, to facilitate the hydrolysis. Among the options, HCl (options A and C) is the appropriate reagent for this step, whereas CH₃COOH (options B and D) is not strong enough for efficient hydrolysis.

Combining these considerations, the correct reagents are H₃O⁺ for the first reaction and HCl for the second reaction, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
