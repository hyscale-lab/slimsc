Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable based on signal-to-noise ratio. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method, right? So it's probably optimized for bright stars because it needs a good signal-to-noise ratio to get accurate measurements.

The question says a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which stars meet this condition.

Looking at the options, each star is given with its distance and absolute V magnitude. Absolute magnitude is a measure of brightness, so the lower the number, the brighter the star. Wait, but absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs. So the actual apparent magnitude depends on how far the star is from us.

Wait, but the question doesn't mention apparent magnitude. Wait, no, wait. The S/N depends on how bright the star appears to us, which is the apparent magnitude. Because the farther away a star is, the dimmer it appears, even if its absolute magnitude is the same.

So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude. Then, knowing the V magnitude, I can estimate the flux, which would determine the S/N.

But how does the V magnitude translate to signal-to-noise ratio? I think that the ESPRESSO spectrograph has a certain sensitivity, which means it can detect stars above a certain brightness.

I remember that the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux. But in this case, the exposure is fixed at 1 hour. So S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux.

Wait, but the formula for S/N is S/N = (flux * exposure time)^(1/2) / noise. But noise is usually proportional to the square root of the flux as well, so S/N might be proportional to (exposure time * (flux / noise^2 ))^(1/2). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

I think a better approach is to look up the typical S/N ESPRESSO
