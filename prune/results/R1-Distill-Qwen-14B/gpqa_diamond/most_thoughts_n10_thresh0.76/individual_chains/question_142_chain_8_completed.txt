Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices. Hmm, the question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to figure out which of the options A to D corresponds to its position.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on density matrices. Let me recall. A density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), and mixed states are statistical ensembles of pure states.

So the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. That looks like a mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. So each state has a 50% chance, right?

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I'm thinking about the Bloch sphere representation. Qubits can be visualized on a Bloch sphere, where the pure states correspond to points on the sphere's surface. The density matrix of a mixed state can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere.

For a single qubit, the Bloch vector r has components (x,y,z), each corresponding to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The density matrix can be written in terms of these. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

So let's break down the given ρ. It is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, let me compute this explicitly. The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]], which is (I)/2.

Comparing this to the general form: (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is (I + r·σ)/2, then for our ρ, it's (I + 0)/2 because the r vector is zero. So r must be (0,0,0), right?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The density matrix ρ = (I)/2 is a completely mixed state, which corresponds to the maximally mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, this is the center, the origin. Because the Bloch vector is zero, the point is at (0,0,0).

So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the correct answer.

Let me double-check. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Since these are orthogonal projectors, adding them gives the identity, so ρ is the identity divided by 2. So yes, the Bloch vector is zero. That points to option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state where the qubit is in a statistical ensemble of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability (50%). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices, and the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the given \(\rho\), we find:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the Bloch vector \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is represented by the point \((0, 0, 0)\). Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the Bloch vector is zero. 

Answer: C
