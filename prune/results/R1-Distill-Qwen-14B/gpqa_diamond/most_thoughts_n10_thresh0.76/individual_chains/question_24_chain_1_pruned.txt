Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, the problem starts with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids decolorize bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has double bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, because they can undergo addition reactions with Br2. So, the mixture X probably contains alkenes or alkynes.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, a new equimolar mixture Y is formed. This Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, so Y has something that doesn't have double bonds anymore. Oh, maybe the reaction is a hydrogenation? Platinum is a catalyst for hydrogenation, right? So, if X has alkenes, treating with H2 and Pt would add hydrogen, turning alkenes into alkanes. But wait, the question says it's a disproportionation reaction. Oh, right, that means one substance is both oxidized and reduced.

Wait, what's a disproportionation reaction? Like when a single species gets split into two, one part is oxidized, the other reduced. So, for example, maybe something like an alkene reacting in such a way that some of it becomes something else. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. Maybe the starting material is an alkyne? Because alkyne hydrogenation with Pt could lead to different products. Oh, wait, but in the problem, mixture X is decolorizing Br2, so it's either an alkene or an alkyne.

Wait, another thought. If X has two compounds that decolorize bromine, perhaps they are different types of alkenes or maybe an alkene and an alkyne. But then, when treated with Pt and H2 (because the mixture is treated with platinum under heat), it's a hydrogenation. Oh, but the product is a mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y must have single bonds only, meaning that all unsaturated bonds are hydrogenated.

But the question says that Y is formed via disproportionation. Hmm, so perhaps the starting material is something that can both add and subtract hydrogen in different parts. Wait, maybe the starting liquid is something like a conjugated diene? Or perhaps it's a cyclic compound? I'm a bit stuck here, but let's move on.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y in the presence of Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let me calculate that. The mass fraction of hydrogen would be (mass of H)/(molar mass) *100. Let's say Z has a formula like CnH2m. Wait, but let me compute the fraction.

Wait, 14.28% is approximately 1/7. So, if Z has a hydrogen content of 14.28%, that's about 1/7. Let's see: the molar mass of hydrogen in Z is (number of H atoms * 1 g/mol) / (molar mass of Z) *100 = 14.28. Let me denote the number of H atoms as x. So, (x * 1)/(12n + x) ) * 100 = 14.28. Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but let's think of small hydrocarbons.

Wait, 14.28% is 1/7. So, 1/7 of the molar mass is H. So, the molar mass of Z is 7 times the mass of H in Z. Let me see possible hydrocarbons.

Take ethane, C2H6. The mass of H is 6 g/mol. The molar mass is 30 g/mol. 6/30 = 0.2, which is 20%, not 14.28%. So not ethane.

How about propane, C3H8? H mass is 8, molar mass is 4
