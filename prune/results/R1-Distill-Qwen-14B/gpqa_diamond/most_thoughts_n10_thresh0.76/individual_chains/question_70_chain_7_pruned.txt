Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem is about a series of reactions. I need to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let me read through the problem again.

So, the first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I know that when metals react with certain gases, it can form compounds. Bright red makes me think of something like copper(II) oxide or maybe something else like iron(III) oxide, but I'm not sure yet. Wait, copper oxide is typically black, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide? No, probably oxide.

Wait, 8 equivalents. That's a lot. Let me think about stoichiometry. If A is reacting with 8 moles of B, what could that ratio mean? Maybe A is a metal with a +2 charge, and B is oxygen gas (O2), so 8 O atoms per A^2+? Because O2 is diatomic, so 8 would be 4 O2 molecules, but that seems a lot. Or perhaps it's another gas.

Hmm, another thought: maybe B is Cl2? Oh wait, but Cl2 is a diatomic molecule. If A is a metal, say, sodium (Na), but 8 Cl2 would be 16 Cl atoms? That doesn't make sense. Wait, sodium forms NaCl, which is 1:1, so maybe not.

Wait another approach: What solid reacts with a gas in a high ratio to form a bright red product. Oh! Maybe A is iron. Iron reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, but I don't think that's bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's sulfur reacting with something? Sulfur is bright yellow, but maybe when it reacts, it forms something red. Or perhaps it's about a transition metal oxide.

Wait, another angle. The product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Then C also reacts with water to give back A plus two different acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, when C is exposed to water, it hydrolyzes. Hmm, that suggests that C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two acids.

Wait, strong acid and weak acid. Let's think: for example, if C is a salt like sulfamic acid or something else. No, wait. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride or a sulfide. Wait, when metal nitrides react with water, they produce NH3 and a strong acid like HNO3. But that's if it's a nitride.

Wait, another possibility: C might be a metal oxide. For instance, if C is a metal oxide that's basic, when it reacts with water, it would produce a strong base. But the problem says F and G are acids, so C is a basic oxide, but upon hydrolysis, perhaps it's producing a weak and a strong acid. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide, which reacts with water to produce H2S (a weak acid) and another acid. Wait, like if C is FeS, reacting with water and acid? No, maybe not.

Wait, another thought. When C reacts with D in a 1:
