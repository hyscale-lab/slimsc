Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, spin states are usually represented as column vectors, right? So I think that means the state vector is [3i; 4]. Or wait, sometimes people write them as row vectors, but in quantum mechanics, the state is a column vector, and observables are represented by matrices. So I think [3i, 4] might be a row vector, but maybe it's a column vector. Oh wait, the way the problem writes it, (3i,4), probably as a column vector. Or perhaps it's a notation where (a, b) represents the state as a column vector [a; b]. So in this case, the state is |ψ> = [3i; 4].

The expectation value of S_y is what we're looking for. I remember that the expectation value of an observable is given by the bra-ket notation: <S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ>. Oh wait, S_y is the spin operator. For spin-½ particles like electrons, the spin operators are given in terms of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y.

The Pauli matrix σ_y is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So first, I need to compute <ψ| S_y |ψ>. Let me write this out.

Let me denote |ψ> as a column vector: [3i; 4]. So ψ is a column vector with components ψ₁ = 3i and ψ₂=4.

The expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So ψ† is [3i*, 4*], which would be [-3, 4], because the conjugate of 3i is -3 (since i* is -i), and 4 is real.

So the steps are:
1. Compute ψ† multiplied by S_y.
2. Then multiply the result by ψ.

Wait
