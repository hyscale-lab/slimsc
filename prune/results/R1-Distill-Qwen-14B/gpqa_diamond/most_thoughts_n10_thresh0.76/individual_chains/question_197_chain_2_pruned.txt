Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Wait, maybe it's related to the hydrolysis of an ester or something like that?

First, I need to figure out what compound X is. Let's look at the spectroscopic data provided.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, probably O-H stretch. Wait, that's a broad peak, so maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, usually broad. But wait, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720. Oh, but wait, the 3400–2500 is broad, which might suggest a carboxylic acid, or maybe an alcohol. But the presence of 1720 could indicate an ester or a ketone, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a very downfield shift, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. So maybe there's a -COOH group. But wait, let me think about other possibilities. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm and
