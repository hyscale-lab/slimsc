Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, a. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining on it along the z-axis, and in the far field, there are intensity maxima and minima. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, right, and small angles are considered so tan theta is approximately theta.

Hmm. I remember from my optics class that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark spots called the diffraction pattern. The specific pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For an infinitely large N, the polygon becomes a circle because as N increases, the number of sides becomes so large that it approximates a circle. So maybe in this case, we're looking at a circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the minima in the intensity pattern. For a circular aperture, the minima occur at specific angles. The first minimum, I think, is at an angle θ given by the formula a sinθ = λ, but wait, no, wait. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a certain condition. Let me think. Oh right, the first minimum for a single slit (which is similar to the circular case in some ways) is when the path difference is λ/2, but for more complex apertures, it's different.

Wait, no, for a circular aperture, the diffraction minima are given by a condition involving Bessel functions. But since the problem says to use the small angle approximation, tanθ ≈ θ, perhaps we can use a simpler approach.

Wait, but wait. The far field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk. The minima in the Airy disk occur where the Bessel function J1 has zeros. The first minimum is at J1(k a) = 0, where k is the wave number. The first zero of J1 is at about 3.8317, but wait, no. Wait, J1's first zero is at approximately pi * (about 3.1416) but wait, no, the first zero is at about 3.8317. But wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a different approach because the polygon has many sides, but it's not exactly a circle. Wait, but when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle.

Wait, but if the polygon is approximated as a circle, then the answer should correspond to the first minima in the Airy pattern. The first minimum occurs when a sinθ = λ, but wait, no, that's for a single slit. For the circular aperture, the minima are at a θ where J1(k a sinθ) = 0, but perhaps in the small angle approximation, this can be simplified.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by the roots of the derivative of the Bessel function, but maybe for small angles, we can approximate it as sinθ ≈ θ. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the diffraction from a circular aperture and the
