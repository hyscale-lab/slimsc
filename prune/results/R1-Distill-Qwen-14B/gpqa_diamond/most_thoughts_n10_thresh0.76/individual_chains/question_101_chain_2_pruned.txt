Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagent and catalyst for the given reaction. Hmm, let's think step by step.

The reaction is an acid-catalyzed one between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I remember that when amines react with certain aldehydes or ketones, especially under acidic conditions, it might be related to some kind of condensation reaction.

Wait, I think this is about the formation of a ring through a Mannich reaction or maybe a Claisen or Aldol addition? Or maybe it's a Beckmann rearrangement? No, Beckmann is about oximes. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a cyclic ketone being formed through an intramolecular process.

Wait, looking at the product structure: 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The cyclohexylidene group is like a cyclohexene ring attached to a methylene group. So the product has a five-membered ring (pyrrolidine) and a six-membered ring fused through a methylene bridge.

Oh, wait! This seems like a case of a ring-expansion. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a five-membered amine. When it reacts with compound A, it forms a new ring. So perhaps the reaction is forming a bicyclic compound.

What kind of reaction forms such a structure? Oh, right! The Cope rearrangement or maybe a Diels-Alder reaction? Or perhaps an acid-catalyzed cyclization involving an aldehyde or ketone.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexene ring. So maybe there's a double bond formed there. Let me think about the reagents. The options for A are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane, and the catalysts are TsOH or acetic acid.

If the reagent is an aldehyde, like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then perhaps the amine is attacking the carbonyl, leading to some kind of imine formation, but under acidic conditions. Wait, in acid, the aldehyde can be protonated, making it a better electrophile. The amine could act as
