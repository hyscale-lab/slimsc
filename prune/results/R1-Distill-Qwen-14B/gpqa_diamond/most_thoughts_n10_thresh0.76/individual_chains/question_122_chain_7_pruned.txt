Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions, and then determining the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the NMR of the final product. 

Alright, let's break it down. The starting material is acetic acid. Then it's treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I think bromine with pyridine... wait, pyridine is often used as a catalyst or to absorb HBr, right? Oh wait, acetic anhydride is a good acetylation agent. So when acetic acid reacts with acetic anhydride, maybe it's an acetylation of something. Wait, but the presence of bromine—oh, maybe it's a bromination reaction. Oh wait, wait. Acetic acid has an -OH group. If we treat it with bromine and pyridine, that's a typical condition for the formation of an acyl bromide. Because acetic anhydride with bromine and pyridine would help substitute the OH in acetic acid with a Br. So product 1 would be acetyl bromide, right? So the structure would be CH3COBr.

Next step: product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. Hmm, what's that reaction look like. Oh, heating an acyl bromide with ethanol would be an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic acyl substitution. So the bromide leaves, and ethanol's oxygen attacks. So product 2 would be ethyl acetate. Structure is CH3COOEt (where Et is CH2CH3).

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide is a source of CN- ions. So ethyl acetate plus NaCN... what happens there? Well, I recall that esters can undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution with CN- as the nucleophile. So the ester would be converted into an acyl cyanide, also known as a cyanate ester? Wait, no, maybe more accurately, the CN would attack the carbonyl, replacing the OR group. So the product 3 would be CH3COCN (acetonitrile?), but wait, no. Wait, when an ester reacts with CN- under certain conditions, like maybe under acidic conditions, it can form a nitrile. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution of the ester's OR group. Wait, I think when an ester reacts with CN- in a basic condition, like aqueous NaCN, it might not do much, but perhaps in an SN2 condition. Alternatively, maybe it's more likely that under certain conditions, the ester would undergo hydrolysis, but here it's with sodium cyanide. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ester is undergoing a substitution reaction. The ester has a good leaving group (the ethoxide, but it's a poor leaving group unless activated). Wait, maybe under basic conditions, it's not so likely. Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are such that the ester is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, but that would be with water, not cyanide. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Sodium cyanide is a nucleophile, so perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution on the ester. So the ethoxy group (OEt-) is a leaving group, but it's not a good leaving group. So maybe the mechanism involves activating the carbonyl. Or perhaps the ethyl ester is first converted to a better leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are such that the ester is converted into an acyl chloride, which is a better leaving group.

Wait, but the reagents here are NaCN. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution where the ethoxy group is replaced by CN. So the reaction would be: CH3COOEt + CN^- → CH3COCN + EtO^- ? But wait, that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the CN is a nucleophile attacking the carbonyl, opening it, and replacing the OR group with CN. So
