Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and it's about a supernova's ejecta moving through space. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that a supernova happened in our Galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? The options are A to D.

Wait, okay, so I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially moving relative to each other, I probably need to use the concept of relative velocity and maybe the Lorentz transformations if it's about relativity. But wait, the problem says both are inertial frames, so maybe it's just a matter of relative velocity without needing to go into special relativity? Or does the speed being 60,000 km/s require considering relativistic effects?

Wait, 60,000 km/s is a huge speed. Let me think about the units. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of the speed of light. That's pretty fast. So relativistic effects might come into play here. But the question is asking about the distance traveled, not about time dilation or length contraction per se. Hmm.

Wait, but how are the frames moving relative to each other? The problem says, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. Because if in one frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, then in the other, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v = 60,000 km/s towards the center. Now, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. We need to find out how much distance the ejecta has traveled in the Galaxy's frame during that time.

Wait a second, that's a bit confusing. Because time intervals can differ between frames. So if 50 seconds pass in
