Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, those are the elements. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually unit vectors, right? So I should probably check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the magnitude. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the squared magnitude is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the magnitude is sqrt(6). Oh wait, but state vectors should have a magnitude of 1. Hmm, so maybe the vector is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))? Oh wait, the question says the state is given by that column matrix. Maybe I should just proceed with it as is, and see where it leads.

The operators for observables P and Q are given as matrices. I remember that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability of each outcome is determined by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

First, I think I need to find the possible eigenvalues (outcomes) for P and Q. Then, since the measurements are done in sequence—first P, then Q after that—wait, no, the problem says
