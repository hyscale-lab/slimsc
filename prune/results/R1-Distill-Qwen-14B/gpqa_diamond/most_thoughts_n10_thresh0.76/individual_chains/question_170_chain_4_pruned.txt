Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spin states and expectation values. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). We need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator in question. In this case, the operator is S_y.

Wait, but wait. Spin operators in quantum mechanics... Right, the spin matrices for electrons are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh right! The spin operator S for a particle with spin-1/2 is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, for the y-component, it should be S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y.

And the σ_y matrix is given as:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So, S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. But maybe I should first write out the matrices and see what I need to do.

The state given is (3i, 4). So the spinor ψ is a two-component vector: ψ = [3i, 4]^T. Oh wait, wait, no—actually, the notation might be that ψ is a column vector. So ψ = [3i; 4], right?

Now, to find the expectation value of S_y, I need to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

Wait, wait, but the spin state is given as (3i,4), which I think is a column vector. So ψ is [3i, 4]^T? Or is it a row vector? No, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are column vectors, so ψ is a column vector with components [3i; 4].

So, the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ.

Let me write it out more clearly. So, ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [3i; 4]

Then, the conjugate transpose ψ† is [ -3 (
