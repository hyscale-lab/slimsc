Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, let me think. The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, I remember that when a substance absorbs a certain wavelength of light, it emits another, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

So, I think the key here is to relate the energy of the emitted light to the wavelength absorbed. Because when a molecule absorbs light, it's usually promoting an electron from a lower energy level to a higher one. The energy of the absorbed photon is what's important here. Oh right, the energy difference between these levels corresponds to the photon's energy.

Wait, but wait, the question says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. So if it's emitting that energy, that must mean it's the energy of the photon that's emitted when the electron drops back down. But wait, I'm a bit confused. So absorption and emission are related by the same energy gap. When the electron gets excited (absorbs a photon), it's in a higher energy state, and then when it drops, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon? Or is there a difference?

Wait, no, I think the energy levels are the same. So if the dye emits a photon with energy E, it absorbed a photon with the same energy E because it's that energy difference that's involved. But wait, maybe not. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it
