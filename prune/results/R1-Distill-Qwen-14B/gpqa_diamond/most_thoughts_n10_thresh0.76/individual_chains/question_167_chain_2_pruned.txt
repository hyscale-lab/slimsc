Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and information theory because they can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are common in many physical systems. Gaussian states include coherent states, squeezed states, and thermal states. Non-Gaussian states often exhibit more complex behavior, like quantum interference effects.

The problem gives me the state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states. The state is written as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) divided by a normalization constant N. Oh wait, I know that when you have a superposition of coherent states with opposite phases, like |alpha> and |-alpha>, it's called a Schrödinger cat state because it's a macroscopic superposition, like a cat being both alive and dead.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). So, I need to compute N for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. Let me calculate sin(2phi) first. Since phi is -pi/4, 2phi is -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So, sin(2phi) is -1. Then, exp(-2 alpha^2) when alpha is 0.5 is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5). I remember exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So N squared is 1 + (-1)*(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Taking the square root, N is sqrt(0.3935) which is approximately 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is normalized because when we take the inner product, we need to ensure it's 1. Now, the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is that of a Gaussian reference state.

Wait, the question is to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) which is the relative entropy between the state and the Gaussian state. But how do I find this? I'm a bit unclear on the details of how the relative entropy is calculated, especially in this context.

I think that for the relative entropy, I need to compute the von Neumann entropy for both rho and tau. Von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho). So, del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau). If rho is non-Gaussian and tau is a Gaussian state, then if rho is more non-Gaussian, this difference would be larger.

But wait, for a pure state, the von Neumann entropy of rho would be zero because rho is a pure state, right? Because rho = |psi><psi|, so Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. But wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Because if rho is a pure state, then rho ln rho is |psi><psi| ln |psi><psi|, and the trace would be zero because ln of a rank-1 projector is not zero. Let me think again.

Wait no, for a pure state rho, the entropy S(rho) is zero because the state is completely predictable. Because for a pure state, the density matrix is idempotent, so Tr(rho^2) = 1. So, S(rho) is zero. Wait, I'm mixing things up. The von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho log rho). But when rho is a pure state, rho has eigenvalues 1 and 0. So the only non-zero eigenvalue is 1, so ln(1) is zero, so the entropy is zero. So S(rho) is zero.

But wait, the state here is |psi>, so rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. So the entropy Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b becomes [0 - S(tau)]? No, wait, the formula is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So if rho is pure, then the first term is zero, so del_b = -Tr(tau ln tau). But wait, that would mean del_b is negative, but non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is, so it's usually a positive quantity. Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, no, looking back, the question says the relative entropy measure is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. Since rho is a non-Gaussian state, and tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps the measure is designed to be positive when rho is non-Gaussian. But for a pure rho (so Tr(rho ln rho) = 0), and if tau is a Gaussian state, which is also pure? Because if it's a coherent state, yes, it's a pure state, so Tr(tau ln tau) would also be zero. Then del_b would be zero, but that can't be right because the options include D) 0. But the question says to compute the non-Gaussianity for the given state. Is the state Gaussian?

Wait a minute, wait. Coherent states are Gaussian. But a superposition of two coherent states is a non-Gaussian state. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian. But then why would del_b be zero? Because if rho is non-Gaussian and tau is Gaussian, then del_b would be a positive number. So I must have made a mistake in my assumption that rho is pure.

Wait no, wait. The state |psi> is a pure state, so rho has rank 1. So Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. But tau is a Gaussian state, which for this problem, I think the reference Gaussian state is... maybe the closest Gaussian state to |psi>? Or perhaps the reference is a specific Gaussian state, like a coherent state. Wait, the problem doesn't specify what the reference Gaussian state is. Oh, that complicates things. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, the question says the relative entropy is given as del_b. So I think that the formula is correct as given. Let me think again. The von Neumann entropy of a pure state is zero, so Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b = 0 - Tr(tau ln tau). But Tr(tau ln tau) is also zero for a pure Gaussian state tau
