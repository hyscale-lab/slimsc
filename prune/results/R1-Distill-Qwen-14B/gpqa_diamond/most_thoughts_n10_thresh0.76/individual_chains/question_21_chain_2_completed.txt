Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers, tautomerism, and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are isomers. Then it splits them into constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the arrangement of atoms, like connectivity, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements. Got it.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which of the other two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism.

Starting with part A. Tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen and the shift of a double bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that to happen, the molecule needs to have a structure where a hydrogen can shift from an acidic alpha position to another, causing the double bond to move.

Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can exist as ortho, meta, or para. But regardless, it has two ketone groups. But for tautomerism, you need an adjacent hydrogen. Wait, benzoquinone's structure... It's O=C6H4=C=O. Oh wait, no, actually, benzoquinone is a dihydroxy structure but oxidized to have two ketone groups. Hmm, no, wait another thought: benzoquinone is the same as 1,4-benzoquinone. So it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So the structure is O=C6H4=O. 

Wait, wait. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on the benzene ring. So, if I imagine the structure, each carbonyl is a double bond to oxygen. So, between the two carbonyls, are there any hydrogens on the adjacent carbons that can shift? Let me think. The benzene ring in benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Each ketone is at adjacent positions. Wait, perhaps in this structure, the carbons next to the ketones (like the ortho positions) would have no hydrogen because the ring is conjugated. Or maybe they do. Wait, for tautomerism, you need alpha hydrogens. Let me think about the structure of benzoquinone.

Benzoquinone has the structure O=C6H4=O. So each of the two carbonyl groups is on the benzene ring. So, each carbonyl is at a para position relative to each other. The benzene ring would have two ketone groups. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring. Do those adjacent carbons have hydrogens? Because if they do, then maybe tautomerism is possible.

Wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one hydrogen (in the case of benzene itself). But when a carbonyl group is present, like in benzaldehyde, the adjacent carbon (the alpha carbon) would have a hydrogen. So in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. So the adjacent carbons would each have a hydrogen. Wait, but wait—because in the ring, each of those carbons is already bonded to two other carbons and a hydrogen. So the alpha position (the carbon next to the carbonyl) would have a hydrogen.

But for tautomerism, like keto-enol, the alpha hydrogen must be present. So, if benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, then it can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but in benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are meta to each other? No, wait, no. Benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, so the two ketone groups are on opposite ends of the benzene ring. Each carbon where the ketone is attached is bonded to two benzene carbons and an oxygen double bond. The adjacent (ortho) carbons might have hydrogens. So, if they do, then maybe tautomerism is possible.

Wait, but wait. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring, so the adjacent carbons (the ortho positions) are each attached to one hydrogen. So would those hydrogens be alpha hydrogens that can participate in tautomerism?

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Because in the ring, each carbon is part of the aromatic system. Wait, no, the alpha carbon would be the one attached to the carbonyl group. So for each of the two carbonyl groups, the adjacent carbon (the one attached to the ring) has a hydrogen. So maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, that can't be right. Because I thought that quinones are generally quite stable and may not have tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this mixed up with other compounds. Another approach: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Its structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So it's a cyclic triketone.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C- in a ring. Wait, no, it's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at every other carbon. So each of those carbonyl carbons is attached to two others in the ring.

In such a structure, each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group? No, wait. Let me think: in the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring is a chair-like structure? Well, with three ketone groups in the 1,3,5 positions. So each carbonyl is attached to the ring. The neighboring carbons (2,4,6) would each have two substituents. Wait, maybe each of those have a hydrogen.

Wait, maybe I should consider whether this compound can undergo tautomerism. For that, it would need an alpha hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. In the trione, each carbonyl is at 1,3,5, so the adjacent carbons (2,4,6) each have two substituents. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about each position. Each of the three carbonyl carbons is part of the ring. The ring is six-membered. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C- connected in a ring.

Wait, so each of the carbonyls is connected to a CH2 group? No, perhaps each has a CH group. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me imagine the structure. Each of the three ketones is on a different carbon, every other position. So between them are CH2 groups? No, perhaps each of the non-ketone carbons is a CH2? No, wait, the ring is six-membered. So positions 1,3,5 are ketones (O=C-), and positions 2,4,6 are CH2 groups.

Wait no, if it's a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two others. So position 1 is O=C-O, but wait, that's probably not correct. Alternatively, each of the carbonyl groups is attached to two adjacent carbons in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at 1,3,5 positions. Each of the ketone carbons is attached to two other ring carbons. So, for example, the carbonyl at position 1 is attached to positions 6 and 2. Positions 2 and 6 are each connected to position 1 and 3 and 6, respectively, but are they CH2 groups or something else?

Wait, perhaps the non-ketone positions (2,4,6) are each CH2 groups. If that's the case, then each of these CH2 groups is adjacent to a ketone. So, for example, position 2 is next to position 1 (a ketone) and position 3 (another ketone). Wait, no, because position 3 is a ketone. So position 2 is between two ketones.

Wait, so if position 2 is CH2, then each of those CH2 groups is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So each of those CH2's would have two hydrogens. So, those hydrogens are alpha hydrogens because they're next to a carbonyl. Therefore, the molecule would have alpha hydrogens and could undergo tautomerism, right?

Wait, but wait. If a molecule has multiple carbonyl groups, then the alpha hydrogens can be involved in tautomerism. But in this case, each of the CH2 groups is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So, each H on the CH2 is alpha to two carbonyls.

So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure has alpha hydrogens. So, could this compound undergo tautomerism?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is so conjugated that the hydrogen isn't acidic enough. Or perhaps the molecule is too stable and doesn't undergo tautomerism.

Wait, another thought. Tautomerism usually requires the presence of at least one alpha hydrogen. If a compound doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, it can't undergo tautomerism. So which of the two compounds (benzoquinone or trione) doesn't have alpha hydrogens?

Benzoquinone: each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (ortho) are each bonded to one hydrogen. So each has an alpha hydrogen.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each CH2 group is between two ketones, so each of those CH2 has two alpha hydrogens. So, the trione definitely has alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but the question says that one of them does NOT show tautomerism. So, which of the two doesn't have alpha hydrogens?

Wait, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. How? Let me think again. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. Each ketone is attached to the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (ortho) on the benzene ring would have a hydrogen. Because in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen unless substituted. So in benzoquinone, each of the two ketones is attached to a carbon, and the next carbon (ortho) would have a hydrogen. So those are alpha hydrogens. So benzoquinone would have alpha hydrogens and could undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the structure of benzoquinone might not allow tautomerism because the necessary hydrogen isn't present. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in a position where tautomerism isn't possible, like in a fully conjugated system.

Alternatively, maybe one of the compounds doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Let me think about another structure. For example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Each of the carbonyls is attached to a carbon that has a hydrogen. So those hydrogens are alpha.

If that's the case, then benzoquinone would have alpha hydrogens and could undergo tautomerism. Then why is the question implying that one of them doesn't? Hmm.

Wait, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Let me think again. The trione has three ketone groups in the ring. So, the structure is O=C-O-C-O-C-O in a ring? No, wait, that's not right. It's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So, each of the three ketones is on alternating carbons. So, the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C- connected in a ring.

Wait, so each O=C is connected to two CH2 groups. No, wait. Each ketone is at position 1, 3, 5. So the carbons at positions 2,4,6 would be CH2 groups, each connected to two ketone groups. So each CH2 is between two carbonyls, right?

So each of those CH2 groups has two hydrogens. Are those hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl groups? Yes, because each is attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. So those hydrogens are alpha and can participate in tautomerism.

So in this case, both benzoquinone and the trione have alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism. But the question states that one does not. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: maybe the trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are connected to more than one substituent, making the hydrogens unavailable for tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione is a fully conjugated system where the hydrogens aren't acidic enough. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's switch to part B for a moment and see if that helps.

Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism? The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center. Alternatively, it can occur in compounds with other forms of asymmetry, like allenes or certain ring structures.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, let me draw it. The molecule is 2-hydroxypropanoate ester. So the propanoate ester has three carbons. The middle carbon (C2) has an OH group. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no, propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-, but with the ester group. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the middle carbon (C2) is connected to: CH2 (from C1), OH, COOCH3 (from C3), and another CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Propanoate has three carbons: the first is the COO- group, then the next two. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be (CH2)2COO- but with an OH on the second carbon. So methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

But in that structure, does the molecule have a chiral center? The C2 would have four different groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH3, and the other side (maybe a hydrogen). Wait, let me see. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the C2 has:

- OH group attached,
- CH2COOCH3 group (a big substituent),
- CH3 group (probably not, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (C2) has:

- OH,
- a CH2 connected to COOCH3,
- a CH2 connected to C1 (which is CH3),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Let me write the structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the OH is on the second carbon, which is the middle one.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's three carbons: the first is CH2(OH), the second is CH2, connected to the third which is COOCH3. So the central carbon (second) has:

- two CH2 groups (left and right),
- an OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, the second carbon would have:

- on the left: a CH2 group (from C1),
- on the right: a CH2 group (to C3, which is attached to COOCH3),
- an OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait no, that can't be because the second carbon would have four substituents. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy version would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

The central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH),
- CH2-COOCH3,
- two hydrogens.

Wait, no, that would make the central carbon have two CH2 groups, which can't be. Maybe the structure is more like:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, that would make the central carbon (CH) have:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen.

Yes, that makes sense. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The central carbon (the CH) has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So yes, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a diacid with two double bonds. The structure of fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So dimethyl fumarate would be (CH3O2C)CH=CH(CO2CH3). So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH(COOCH3), but wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO₂CCH₂CH₂CO₂H? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. So the dimethyl ester would be (CH3O₂C)CH=CHCO₂CH3, which is more correctly written as CH₂(COOCH3)=CHCO₂CH3? No, wait, no. Let me get it right. The structure is CH₂=CH group with both ends esterified. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3), but that's not right. Wait, fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. So its structure is HO₂CCH₂CH₂CO₂H, but wait, no, that would be succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. So the dimethyl ester would be (CH3O₂C)CH=CHCO₂CH3.

So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)=CH–COOCH3. No, wait, the correct structure would have two ester groups on either end of the double bond. So it's O₂C(CH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂CH3? No, wait, that's incorrect. Let me draw it correctly.

Fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. So the dimethyl ester would replace both -OH of the carboxylic acids with OMe groups. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure becomes (CH3O₂C)CH=CH(CO₂CH3). So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C(CH3)-CH=CH-CO₂CH3
       |
       O

Wait, no. The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO2CH3.

Wait, the molecule has a double bond between the two central carbons. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO2CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, fumarate is a trans-dioic acid, so the ester would have the two ester groups on opposite ends of a double bond.

So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as:

CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3), but wait, no, because that's a single bond. Fumarate has a double bond, so it's CH₂=CH with each carbon attached to a COOCH3 group.

So, the structure is:

O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂CH3? No, that can't be. Let me think again.

No, fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. So the dimethyl ester is CH₂(COOCH3)=CHCO₂CH3. Wait, no, that would be CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group attached.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂CH3?

No, that's not right. Let me see: the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂CH3, which is succinic acid dimethyl ester, not fumarate. Fumarate has a double bond.

Ah, right. Fumarate's structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO₂CH3. So, the molecule is:

O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO₂CH3.

In this structure, the central two carbons are double-bonded. Each of these has a COOCH3 group attached.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid has the double bond between the two central carbons, each attached to a carboxylic acid (or ester) group. So the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid is:

(CH3O₂C)CH=CH(CO₂CH3).

So, the structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, but that would mean each double-bonded carbon has a COOCH3 group. So each of these carbons is attached to COOCH3, another CH group, and the double bond.

Wait, since the double bond is between two carbons, each of which has two substituents (COOCH3), it's more like:

COOCH3
|
CH₂=CH
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me imagine the structure correctly. Fumaric acid is a trans-dioic acid, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

In the ester form, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO₂CH3. The double bond is between the two middle carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group.

So, considering the structure, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Well, each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups (the double bond and the rest). Wait, no, each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and one CH group. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So each double-bonded carbon has:

- One COOCH3 group,
- Two CH₂ groups? Wait, no. Let me think: when you have CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), each double-bonded carbon has a COOCH3, and two CH₂ groups connected? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps each double-bonded carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH group on either side.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C= C
|
COOCH3

No, that can't be possible because each C can only have four bonds. So, each carbon in the double bond has:

- One COOCH3 group,
- Two other substituents (like CH2 groups? Not sure).

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon in dimethyl fumarate has one COOCH3, one CH3 group, and two Hs? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified with methanol, both -COOH groups become -COOCH3. So the structure becomes O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO₂CH3.

So, each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) has:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One H,
- And two CH₂ groups? No, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂CH3.

No, that's a single bond, which would make it succinic acid dimethyl ester, not fumarate.

Back to the drawing board. Fumaric acid is a trans-dioic acid, which means its structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's succinic acid. No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, it's a cis or trans isomer? No, wait, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid. So, its structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's succinic. Wait, no.

Wait, butenedioic acid can be either cis or trans. Trans is fumaric, cis is maleic. So, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's succinic. Wait, no, butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that can't be because that's four carbons with two double bonds. Wait, no, butenedioic acid is four carbons with a double bond between C2 and C3.

So, but-2-enedioic acid would be HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's succinic. Wait, perhaps butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which is four carbons in total.

So, for fumarate, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO₂CH3. So, the two central carbons are double-bonded, each attached to a COOCH3 group.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? No, because each of the double-bonded carbons has two identical substituents (the COOCH3 groups). So, each of these carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a single bond to another carbon. But wait, that can't be because each carbon can have only four bonds.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think differently. The molecule is (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). The two central carbons are each attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH group,
- And two H's? No, that can't be right because that would give each carbon three bonds only.

Wait, perhaps each of the central carbons has:

- One COOCH3,
- One CH₂ group,
- And two H's.

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps each has a COOCH3, a CH, and the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each central carbon is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- CH₂,
- and the double bond.

But that doesn't resolve the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the central carbons has two COOCH3 groups, but that doesn't make sense because then it would be a geminal di-substitution, which isn't possible.

I think I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the key point is that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Because each of the double-bonded carbons has two substituents that are the same (COOCH3 groups). Therefore, the molecule is planar and doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the molecule has a plane of symmetry. In dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. So, it doesn't have a chiral center, hence no optical isomerism.

So, to recap: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the central carbon) and can exhibit optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and is symmetrical, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, and if the groups on either side are the same, the molecule could be meso. Wait, no, that's not the case here. Because each double-bonded carbon is attached to the same group (COOCH3), making the molecule symmetrical.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate does not.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier when I thought the trione might not have alpha hydrogens. Hmm.

Wait, going back to part A. So, the question is, which of the two compounds (benzoquinone and trione) does not show tautomerism.

Earlier, I thought both have alpha hydrogens. But perhaps one of them doesn't. Let me think about benzoquinone again.

Benzoquinone has two ketones on the benzene ring. Each of the two adjacent (ortho) carbons would have a hydrogen. So, each of those H's is alpha to a carbonyl group. So benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but wait, quinones are often involved in enol tautomerism? Or is that not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the ring is conjugated, making the alpha hydrogens not acidic enough to allow tautomerism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Let me think. The trione is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Each of the three carbonyl groups is adjacent to a CH2 group. Each of those CH2 groups has two hydrogens, which are alpha to the carbonyl. So, they can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but then why would the question state that one doesn't show tautomerism. Hmm.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Let me think again. Benzoquinone structure is O=C6H4=O. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (ortho positions) have one hydrogen each. So, each of those hydrogens is alpha and can participate in tautomerism.

So, both benzoquinone and the trione have alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism, but the question says one does not. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the trione is a cyclic structure where the alpha hydrogens are not present because of the ring's structure. For example, in a fully conjugated system, perhaps the hydrogens are not there. Hmm.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups in the ring. So, the structure would have each ketone at 1,3,5 positions. The carbons at 2,4,6 would each have two substituents. Let me think: each of those (2,4,6) would be CH2 groups. So each has two hydrogens, which are alpha to the ketones. So, tautomerism is possible.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, while the trione does. But why?

Wait, another possibility: in benzoquinone, the alpha hydrogens are in conjugation with the aromatic ring, making them unavailable for tautomerism. Or perhaps the structure doesn't allow for the movement of the hydrogen because of the ring's stability.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, because each ketone is attached to a carbon that has a hydrogen.

Wait, I'm really stuck on part A. Let me think again. The question states that one of the two compounds does not show tautomerism. Based on the initial analysis, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism, while the trione also has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism. But that can't be, as the question implies one doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Because each of the carbons between the ketones is a CH2 group. So each CH2 has two H's that are alpha. Therefore, they can undergo tautomerism. So the trione would exhibit tautomerism.

If both have alpha hydrogens, then neither is the correct answer for part A. But that's not possible. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing the structures.

Alternative approach: Which of the two, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, lacks alpha hydrogens?

Benzoquinone: each ketone is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (ortho) are each bonded to a hydrogen. So, each has an alpha H. So, tautomerism is possible.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each ketone is part of a six-membered ring, and the adjacent carbons (CH2 groups) have two H's each. So, alpha H's are present. Tautomerism possible.

Wait, but perhaps the trione's structure doesn't allow tautomerism because the ring's strain or other factors prevent it. I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the trione is a fully conjugated system, making the alpha hydrogens too stable to shift. Or, perhaps the molecule is too rigid. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are connected to more than one substituent, making the H's not alpha. But I think that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the trione's structure is such that the alpha hydrogens are on bridgehead positions, which may not allow tautomerism due to the ring's structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone lacks alpha hydrogens. Wait, but that's not correct because each ketone is attached to a carbon with a hydrogen.

Hmm. Given the time I've spent on this, perhaps I should proceed with the information I have.

So, for part A: The compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Because perhaps it doesn't have any alpha hydrogens.

Wait, another possibility: Benzoquinone is aromatic and the presence of the conjugated system makes the hydrogens not acidic enough for tautomerism. Alternatively, the molecule is too stable due to resonance, making tautomerism impossible.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the trione has no alpha hydrogens because the CH2 groups are not adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the trione's structure is such that the adjacent carbons are part of the ring and don't have any hydrogens. For example, if each of the non-ketone carbons is connected to two other carbons, perhaps without any H's. But that can't be because the ring is six-membered. Each non-ketone carbon would have two substituents (the ring carbons) and perhaps two H's.

I'm stuck on part A. Let me try to proceed with part B and see how the options fit.

From part B, the correct answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (has a chiral center) exhibits optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate (does not have a chiral center) does not. So, for part B, the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but no. The question for part B is which one will show optical isomerism. So, if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, it will show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate doesn't, so it doesn't.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

From part B, the correct B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the possible options are A or B.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says A is the trione and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That would mean that the trione doesn't show tautomerism (A is the one that doesn't), which I'm not sure about.

Another option is option D: A is benzoquinone, and B is dimethyl fumarate. But for B, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, which doesn't fit.

Wait, no, the correct B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the options with B correct are A and B.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, for part A, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. So, is that correct?

If benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens, then A would be benzoquinone. But earlier analysis suggested it does have alpha hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, making it unable to tautomerize. If that's the case, then option D (A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate) would be incorrect because part B requires methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate to show optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try to summarize:

Part A: Which doesn't show tautomerism?

Assuming that the trione doesn't, then A is the trione.

Part B: Which shows optical isomerism? Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Thus, the correct option would be option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But earlier confusion about the trione's alpha hydrogens makes me uncertain.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Let me think: in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to a hydrogen unless it's part of a substituent. So in benzoquinone, each ketone is attached to a carbon, and the adjacent (ortho) carbons each have a hydrogen. So each ketone has an alpha hydrogen. Then, benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism.

Thus, the trione might be the one that doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the trione's structure is such that the alpha hydrogens are on bridgehead positions, which are not allowed to rotate, making tautomerism impossible. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione's structure doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because each non-ketone carbon is attached to two carbonyl groups. Wait, no, because each non-ketone carbon is CH2, which has two hydrogens.

So, perhaps both can undergo tautomerism, but the question requires one to not. So I'm stuck.

But given the time, I'll proceed with the assumption that the trione doesn't show tautomerism, so option A is correct.


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (Part A) and which compound exhibits optical isomerism (Part B). Here's the analysis:

### Part A: Tautomerism
Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups). 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (ortho positions) each have a hydrogen. These hydrogens are alpha hydrogens, allowing benzoquinone to undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups, each with two hydrogens. These hydrogens are alpha hydrogens, allowing cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to undergo tautomerism.

Given the analysis, both compounds appear to have alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism. However, the question implies that one does not. Based on the reasoning provided, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** is assumed to be the compound that does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Optical Isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and a hydrogen, making it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is (CH₃O₂C)-CH=CH-(CO₂CH₃). The double-bonded carbons are identical on both sides, and there are no chiral centers. Thus, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Final Answer
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.
- For Part B, the compound that exhibits optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

Answer: A
