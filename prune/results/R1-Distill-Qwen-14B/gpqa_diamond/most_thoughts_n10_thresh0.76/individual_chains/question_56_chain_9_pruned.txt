Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Dipole transitions specifically are governed by the electric dipole selection rules.

So, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. Now, the decay happens in two steps, each involving a dipole transition. So the electron goes from 3 to something, then to 1.

The selection rules for electric dipole transitions (which are the dominant mechanism here) are:

Δn = ±1 (but wait, no, that's for hydrogen's energy levels? Or is it Δn any integer? Wait, no, I think for hydrogen, the selection rules are Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. But wait, for hydrogen, since it's a spherically symmetric potential, the radial part doesn't affect the selection rules as much. Hmm, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact selection rules for the principal quantum number n.

Wait, no, the selection rules for the electric dipole transitions are usually Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. But for hydrogen, the n can change as long as l changes by ±1. Because the selection rules are based on the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which are proportional to r Y_{lm}, so the integral involves Y_{l' m'}* r Y_{l m} ψ_n(r).

So for the dipole transition, the l must change by ±1. So from l=0, the initial state is l=0. So when it transitions, the next state must have l=1. Because 0 can only go to l=1, since Δl = +1. So the first transition must be from l=0 to l=1, so n can change as well, but in two steps.

Wait, but the initial state is n=3, l=0. So possible transitions in the first step: n can decrease or increase? But if it's going from n=3 to
