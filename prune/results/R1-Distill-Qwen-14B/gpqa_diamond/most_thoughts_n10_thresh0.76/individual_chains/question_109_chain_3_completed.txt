Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. So, the initial state is 1S0, and after emitting X, the NN system ends up in another state, and we need to determine which partial wave is not allowed based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

Wait, the problem states that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh, right, that's because of the Pauli exclusion principle. So, T is isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. The sum T + S + L must be even or odd based on this equation.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, T is 0. Plugging into the equation: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Which simplifies to S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So, S and L must be such that their sum is odd. So, either S is even and L is odd, or S is odd and L is even.

Now, the options are the different transitions, each involving a particle emission. Let's look at each option.

Each option is in the format initial state -> final state + particle. The initial state is 1S0, so S=0 (since 1S0 is (2S+1)=1, so S=0), and L=0 because it's S-state. So, the initial parity is parity of S-state, which is (-1)^L = 1.

The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So, after emission, the parity of the system (NN plus X) must be conserved. Wait, no, parity isn't necessarily conserved here. Wait, no, in strong interactions, parity is conserved, but weak interactions don't. But the problem says to consider the conservation of both angular momentum and parity, so I think parity conservation applies here. So the initial parity times the parity of X should equal the final parity of the NN state times the parity of the emitted particle. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the parity of the entire system before and after emission should be the same.

Wait, the initial state is the NN system, parity P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. Since initial state is 1S0, L is 0, so P_initial =1. The emitted particle X has parity -1. The final state is the NN in some state, and X is emitted. So, the parity after emission would be P_final = P_NN_final * P_X. But the initial parity is just P_NN_initial. So,

P_initial = P_NN_initial = 1.
After emission, the total parity is P_NN_final * P_X. So, 1 = P_NN_final * (-1). Therefore, P_NN_final = -1.

So the parity of the NN final state must be -1. So, the parity of the NN final state is (-1)^{L_final} = -1. Therefore, L_final must be odd because (-1)^odd is -1.

Wait, no, wait. The parity of the NN state is determined by their orbital angular momentum. Let me think: the parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L}. So, for the final state, L must be such that (-1)^{L} = -1 → L is odd.

So, for each option, I need to determine the final state of NN and see its L. The options are:

A) 7D1 + p
B) 3S1 + p
C) 3D3 + f
D) 3P0 + s

Wait, the part after the plus sign is the particle emitted, I think. So, the emitted particles are p, p, f, s. Wait, probably p is a pseudoscalar meson, f could be something else, but I think in terms of the problem, the parity of the emitted particle is given as -1.

Wait, the problem states that the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So, all options emit a particle with parity -1.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which has parity 1. After emitting X (parity -1), the final NN state must have parity P_final. So, overall parity must be conserved. So, initial parity is 1. After emission, the parity is P_NN_final * P_X. So, 1 = P_NN_final * (-1), so P_NN_final must be -1. Therefore, the final state's parity is -1, which as I said implies that L_final is odd.

So, looking at each option's final NN state:

Option A) 7D1: The state is D, which is L=2 (since D is L=2). So parity would be (-1)^2 = 1. But we need parity -1. So this can't be allowed because the final state's parity is 1, but we needed -1. So this would violate parity conservation. So option A's final state has L=2, even. So parity is 1. So that would make the total parity after emission: 1 * (-1) = -1, but initial parity is 1. So 1 ≠ -1, which violates parity conservation. Therefore, option A is not allowed.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me make sure. The initial parity is 1, and after emission, the parity is P_NN * P_X. So:

P_initial = P_NN_initial * P_X_initial. Wait, wait, no, the initial state is just the NN system. So, the initial parity is P_NN_initial. The final state is NN and X. So, the total parity after emission is P_NN_final * P_X. So, the initial parity (1) must equal the final total parity (since it's the same system before and after emission, assuming parity is conserved).

So, 1 = P_NN_final * (-1). So, P_NN_final = -1. So, (-1)^(L_final) = -1 → L_final is odd.

So, the final state must have L_final as odd.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 7D1. D is L=2, which is even. So, L_final is 2. So (-1)^2 = 1. So P_NN_final is 1. So, this would make the total parity after emission 1 * (-1) = -1, but initial is 1. So this can't happen. Therefore, option A is forbidden due to parity violation.

Option B: 3S1. S is L=0, even. P_NN_final is (-1)^0=1. So, total parity after emission is 1 * (-1) = -1. Which doesn't match initial parity 1. So this is also forbidden. So wait, but if the final state is 3S1, which is L=0 (even), then parity is 1. So 1 * (-1) = -1, which doesn't match initial 1, so this is invalid. Therefore, option B is forbidden.

Wait, but the problem says that the final NN state has T=0. So, we have to also consider the condition on T, S, and L.

Wait, but I think the parity condition is more general. So, if any option doesn't satisfy the parity condition, it's forbidden regardless of the other conditions.

So, looking back, options A and B have L_final even, which would make parity 1, leading to a total parity of -1, which doesn't match initial 1. So, both would be forbidden.

But wait, the problem statement says that the final NN state must have T=0, and we have the condition T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So, let's see each option.

But wait, perhaps the parity condition is already too restrictive, so maybe it's easier to first check which options have L_final even, as they would be invalid.

So, checking each option:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 (D is 2), which is even. So parity of NN is 1, which doesn't meet the required parity of -1. So, option A is forbidden.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0, even. Again, parity of NN is 1. Forbidden.

Option C: 3D3 → L=2, even. Parity would be 1. Forbidden.

Option D: 3P0 → L=1 (P is 1), which is odd. So, parity is (-1)^1 = -1. So, total parity is (-1) * (-1) = 1, which matches initial. So, parity is conserved in option D.

Wait, but let's check the other options again.

Option C: 3D3. L=2, parity 1. So, same as A and B. So parity would be 1 * (-1) = -1, which doesn't match initial 1. So, option C is invalid.

Only option D has L=1, which is odd, so parity is -1, leading to (-1) * (-1) = 1, which matches the initial parity.

So, from parity alone, only options with L_final odd are allowed. So, only D is possible in terms of parity.

Wait, but the question is to find which partial wave is not permitted. So, the options are A, B, C, D. The forbidden ones would be those with even L_final, which are A, B, and C. But the problem only gives four options, and the question is which is not permitted.

Wait, but the question is, which partial wave is not permitted. So, the options are the possible transitions. The question is which one isn't allowed.

Wait, but according to the parity condition, options A, B, and C have L_final even, so their final state's parity is 1, leading to a total parity of -1, which is different from initial 1. So these are not allowed. But the options are each a transition, and the question is which is not permitted.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing the parity of the emitted particle with the overall parity. Let me think again.

The initial state (NN) has parity P_initial = 1. The final state is NN' + X. So, the parity of the initial is 1, and the parity after emission is P_NN' * P_X. Since X has parity -1, the total after is P_NN' * (-1). So, for parity conservation, 1 = P_NN' * (-1) → P_NN' = -1.

So, the parity of the final NN state must be -1. So, (-1)^{L_final} = -1 → L_final must be odd.

So, the final state must have L_final odd. So, looking at the options:

Option A: final state is 7D1 → L=2 (even) → P=-1^2=1 → no, that's not allowed.

Option B: final state is 3S1 → L=0 (even) → P=1 → no.

Option C: 3D3 → L=2 (even) → P=1 → no.

Option D: 3P0 → L=1 (odd) → P=-1 → yes, allowed.

So, all except option D have L_final even, making their parities incompatible. So, these are forbidden.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So, each option's transition is a possible emission, but which one is not allowed.

Wait, but the options are all possible transitions, and we're to pick the one that's not allowed. So, perhaps the correct answer is options A, B, and C are forbidden, but since only one of them is an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the problem also gives a condition about the isospin, angular momentum, and spin. So, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So, the final state's S and L must satisfy S + L is odd.

So, for each option, the final state's L and S must satisfy S + L is odd.

Let me look at each option's final state:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2, J=1. Wait, the term is (2S+1)L^J. So, the term is 7D1. Let me parse that: 7 is (2S+1), so 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D, which is 2. J is 1.

So, S=3, L=2. S + L =5 → odd. So, 5 mod 2 is 1. So, T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = 3 + 2 +1 mod 2? Wait, no, S and L are the spin and orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. So, S is the spin quantum number, which is 3 (since S=3). L is 2.

So, S + L =3 + 2=5 → odd. So, 0 ≡ 5 +1 mod 2 → 0 ≡ 6 mod 2 → 0 ≡ 0. So that's okay. Wait, no: the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So, T=0 = (3 + 2) +1 mod 2 → 3+2=5, +1=6 → 6 mod2=0. So condition is satisfied.

But wait, the parity condition in option A is not satisfied, so option A is forbidden regardless.

Option B: 3S1 → term is 3S1. So, (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S (so L=0). J=1.

So, S=1, L=0. S+L=1 → odd. So, 0 = 1 +1 mod 2 → 0 = 2 mod2 → 0=0. So condition is satisfied.

But parity: L=0, so parity is 1 → total parity after emission is 1*(-1)=-1, which doesn't match initial. So, option B is forbidden.

Option C: 3D3. Term: 3D3. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=D=2. J=3.

So, S=1, L=2. S+L=3 → odd. So, condition holds (0=3+1 mod2 → 0=4 mod2 → 0=0).

But parity: L=2 → parity 1. So, after emission, parity is 1*(-1)=-1, which doesn't match initial 1. So option C is forbidden.

Option D: 3P0. Term: 3P0. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=P=1. J=0.

So, S=1, L=1. S+L=2 → even. 0 = 2 +1 mod2 → 0=3 mod2 → 0=1 → which is false. So, condition not satisfied. So, option D violates the condition.

Wait, that's confusing. Because earlier, parity-wise, option D was allowed. But according to the T condition, it's not allowed.

Hmm. So, perhaps the parity condition is satisfied for D, but T condition isn't. So, which one is the correct answer?

Wait, the problem says that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers must satisfy T = S + L +1 mod2. So, for each option, even if parity is satisfied, they must satisfy this condition.

So, for option D: S=1, L=1. So, S+L=2 → even. So, T = (1 +1) +1 mod2 → (2+1)=3 → 3 mod2=1. But T is given as 0. So, this condition isn't met. So, option D is forbidden.

Wait, but earlier, I thought option D's parity condition was fine. So, how do these two conditions combine?

So, let me restate: In order for a process to be allowed, both parity must be conserved, and the condition on T, S, L must hold.

So, looking for which options satisfy both.

Option A: T condition is okay, but parity is not.

Option B: T condition is okay, but parity is not.

Option C: T condition is okay, but parity is not.

Option D: T condition is not okay, but parity is okay.

Wait, no, option D: T condition is 0 = (S + L) +1 mod2. S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2. 2 +1=3 → 3 mod2=1. So, T=1, but given T=0. So, condition not satisfied. So, option D is forbidden.

So, all options are forbidden except none? That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the term symbols.

Wait, the term is given as (2S+1)L^J.

For option D: 3P0.

So, (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=P → L=1. J=0.

So, S=1, L=1.

So, condition: T = S + L +1 mod2 → 0 = 1 +1 +1 mod2 → 0=3 mod2 → 0=1 → no, condition not met.

So, it's forbidden.

So, all options are forbidden, but that's not possible because the question states that one of them is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.

So, substituting T=0:

0 ≡ S + L +1 mod2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod2.

So, S and L must be such that their sum is odd.

So, for each option:

Option A: S=3, L=2. 3+2=5 → 1 mod2. So, yes, condition met.

Option B: S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 → condition met.

Option C: S=1, L=2 → 3 → 1 mod2. Condition met.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → 2 → 0 mod2. Doesn't meet condition.

So, options A, B, and C meet the condition, except D doesn't. But wait, earlier, considering parity, only D has L=1 (odd) which allowed parity conservation.

Wait, but in terms of parity, only D has L=1 (odd), which makes P_NN_final = -1. So, for the other options, their L is even, which makes P_NN_final=1, leading to parity conservation not holding.

So, the conclusion is that only option D could possibly satisfy both conditions, but it doesn't because the T condition is not met. So, what's the correct approach?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine.

The initial state: 1S0. So, S=0, L=0. So, initial T is not given, but after emission, T=0.

Wait, but the Pauli condition applies to the final state. So, after emission, the NN system has T=0.

So, the final state's T must be 0, and must satisfy T = S + L +1 mod2.

So, for each option, we have to check:

1. Does the parity condition hold (i.e., P_NN_final must be -1).

2. Does T = S + L +1 mod2 hold for the final state.

Only the option that meets both is allowed. The others are forbidden.

So, for each option:

Option A: 7D1.

- S=3, L=2, J=1.

Parity: L=2 → P=1 → which when multiplied by X's parity (-1) gives total parity -1, which doesn't match initial 1. So, option A is forbidden.

Option B: 3S1.

- S=1, L=0, J=1.

Parity: L=0 → P=1 → total parity after is -1 ≠ 1. Forbidden.

Option C: 3D3.

- S=1, L=2, J=3.

Parity: L=2 → P=1 → total parity after is -1 ≠ 1. Forbidden.

Option D: 3P0.

- S=1, L=1, J=0.

Parity: L=1 → P=-1 → total parity after is (-1)*(-1)=1, which matches initial. So, parity condition holds.

Now, check T condition:

T=0 ≡ S + L +1 mod2 → 1 +1 +1 =3 → 3 mod2=1. So 0≡1 mod2 → false. So, condition not met. Thus, forbidden.

So, all four options are forbidden. But that can't be the case because the problem states that one is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the application of the condition. The condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2.

But wait, perhaps T refers to the isospin of the final state. So, for each option, the final state must have T=0.

But for the condition T = S + L +1 mod 2, the sum S + L +1 must be even for T=0. Because 0 mod2 is even.

Wait, no. Because mod2, 0 is even, 1 is odd.

So, T=0 → (S + L +1) mod2 = 0 → (S + L +1) must be even.

Which implies S + L must be odd.

So, for each option, S + L must be odd.

So:

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 (odd) → condition holds.

Option B: S=1, L=0 →1+0=1 (odd) → condition holds.

Option C: S=1, L=2 →3 (odd) → condition holds.

Option D: S=1, L=1 →2 (even) → condition not holds.

So, for options A, B, C, condition holds, but their parity doesn't.

Only option D has parity condition satisfied, but T condition not.

So, the only possible allowed option would be none, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the options. Let me read the options again.

Options:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p

B) 1S0 →3S1 + p

C) 1S0 →3D3 +f

D) 1S0 →3P0 +s

So, the emitted particles are p, p, f, s. The letters p, s, d, f indicate the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Wait, no, wait. No, the letters in the emitted particle denote their orbital angular momentum? Or is it the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle in the decay? Hmm, no, the emitted particle's intrinsic parity is given as -1, but the letters p, s, d, f denote their orbital angular momentum state in their own decay, perhaps.

Wait, no, the letters after the plus signs in the options denote the type of particle emitted, not the orbital angular momentum state of the emitted particle. Wait, the term symbol is for the NN state. The emitted particle's state is denoted by letters like p, s, f, which are the spectroscopic notation for their angular momentum.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing this. The emitted particle X has a certain angular momentum state, denoted by the lowercase letters. So, for example, if X is emitted in a p-state, that means its orbital angular momentum is l=1.

But wait, in the question, the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So, perhaps the parity of X is also determined by its orbital angular momentum. Wait, the intrinsic parity is given, which is independent of angular momentum. So, regardless of the state (p, s, f, etc.), the intrinsic parity is -1.

So, the parity of the emitted particle is fixed at -1, regardless of its emitted state.

So, the parity condition remains the same: initial parity is 1. After emission, the parity is P_NN_final * (-1). So, 1 = P_NN_final * (-1) → P_NN_final = -1 → L_final must be odd.

So, the emitted particle's state (like p, s, f) doesn't affect the parity condition of the NN state, only the particle's own parity is considered, which is -1.

So, the previous analysis holds: only option D has L_final=1 (odd), so P_NN_final=-1, leading to total parity after emission being 1. The other options have even L_final, leading to P_NN_final=1, which would make the total parity after emission -1, which doesn't match initial.

So, among the options, only D has parity allowed, but its T condition is not met.

Wait, so the problem is to choose which partial wave is not permitted. So, the options are the possible transitions, and the question is which one is not allowed.

So, the options are transitions where the emitted particle is in a particular partial wave (p, s, f, etc.), but perhaps the p, s, etc., denote the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle.

Wait, the problem says: "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X".

Ah! So, the letters p, s, f, etc., denote the angular momentum (l) of the emitted particle X.

So, in option A, X is emitted in a p-state: l=1.

Similarly, in option B, X is in an s-state: l=0.

In option C, X is in f-state: l=3.

In option D, X is in s-state: l=0.

So, the parity of X is (-1)^{l} * intrinsic parity.

Wait, the intrinsic parity is given as -1. So, the overall parity of the emitted particle is (-1)^l * (-1). So, for each emitted particle's state, it's (-1)^{l} * (-1) = (-1)^{l+1}.

But the parity of the entire system must be conserved. So, initial parity is 1.

After emission, the parity is [P_NN_final] * [P_X].

P_X is (-1)^{l+1}.

So, 1 = [P_NN_final] * [ (-1)^{l+1} ].

But P_NN_final is (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.

So, 1 = [ (-1)^{L_final} ] * [ (-1)^{l} * (-1) ]

→ 1 = (-1)^{L_final + l + 1}.

Which simplifies to (-1)^{L_final + l + 1} = 1 → L_final + l + 1 must be even.

So, L_final + l +1 ≡0 mod2 → L_final + l ≡1 mod2.

So, that's an additional condition.

Wait, but earlier we had another condition: T=0 = S + L_final +1 mod2 → S + L_final ≡1 mod2.

So, combining both conditions:

1. L_final + l ≡1 mod2.

2. S + L_final ≡1 mod2.

So, combining the two:

From 1: L_final + l ≡1 → L_final ≡1 - l mod2.

From 2: S + L_final ≡1 → substituting L_final ≡1 - l → S + (1 - l) ≡1 → S - l ≡0 mod2 → S ≡ l mod2.

So, the spin of the final NN state (S) must have the same parity as the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (l).

So, for each option, we can calculate S and l, and check if S and l have the same parity.

Additionally, we have to ensure that L_final is such that L_final + l is odd (from condition 1).

So, let's process each option:

Option A: 7D1 + p.

Final NN state: 7D1 → term is (2S+1)L^J. 7D1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3. L=D=2.

Emitted particle X: p → l=1.

Condition 2: S=3, l=1. S and l have parities 3 mod2=1, 1 mod2=1 → same. So, condition holds.

Condition 1: L_final=2, l=1 → 2+1=3 → odd → condition holds.

So, parity condition holds.

Now, check the T condition: T=0= S + L_final +1 mod2 → 3 + 2 +1=6 → 6 mod2=0 → condition holds.

So, all conditions are met for option A. So, it's allowed.

Option B: 3S1 +p.

Wait, wait, no: the option is 3S1 + p. So, the final state is 3S1, and X is p.

So, final NN state: 3S1 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=S=0.

Emitted X: p → l=1.

Condition 2: S=1, l=1 → same parity → condition holds.

Condition1: L_final=0 + l=1 → 0+1=1 → odd → condition holds.

Parity condition: [P_NN_final] = (-1)^{L_final}=1.

P_X: (-1)^{l} * (-1) → (-1)^1 * (-1) = (-1)*(-1)=1. So, total parity after emission → 1 * 1 =1, same as initial. So, parity condition holds.

T condition: S=1, L_final=0 → 1+0+1=2 → mod2=0. So, T=0 holds.

So, all conditions are met for option B. So, it's allowed.

Option C: 3D3 +f.

Final state: 3D3 → S=1, L=2.

Emitted X: f → l=3.

Condition2: S=1, l=3 → both odd → same parity → condition holds.

Condition1: L_final=2 + l=3 →5 → odd → condition holds.

Parity: P_NN_final= (-1)^2=1.

P_X: (-1)^3 * (-1)= (-1)*(-1)=1. So, total parity after emission: 1*1=1 → matches initial.

T condition: S=1, L_final=2 → 1 +2 +1=4 → mod2=0 → T=0 holds.

So, all conditions are met → option C is allowed.

Option D:3P0 +s.

Final state:3P0 → S=1, L=1.

Emitted X: s → l=0.

Condition2: S=1, l=0 → 1 is odd, 0 even → different parity → condition fails.

So, condition2 not met → process is forbidden.

Thus, option D is not allowed.

Wait, but earlier when I didn't consider the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum, I thought option D was the only one with correct parity. But upon considering the emitted particle's l, now I see that option D fails condition2 because S=1, l=0 → different parities.

So, therefore, the only option that is not permitted is option D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State and Parity Conservation**:  
   The initial state is \( 1S_0 \), which has \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and intrinsic parity \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \). After emitting a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( -1 \), the parity of the final state must satisfy:  
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN, final}} \cdot P_X
   \]  
   Substituting \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \) and \( P_X = -1 \), we find:  
   \[
   P_{\text{NN, final}} = -1
   \]  
   The parity of the NN final state is determined by \( (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \), so \( L_{\text{final}} \) must be odd.

2. **Pauli Statistics Condition**:  
   The isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state must satisfy:  
   \[
   T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)
   \]  
   Since \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)
   \]  
   Thus, \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \) must be odd.

3. **Analysis of Each Option**:  
   For each option, we determine the final NN state's \( S_{\text{NN}} \), \( L_{\text{NN}} \), and whether the conditions are satisfied. The emitted particle \( X \) has orbital angular momentum \( l \), and its parity is \( (-1)^l \cdot (-1) \). The total parity after emission is:  
   \[
   P_{\text{total, final}} = P_{\text{NN, final}} \cdot P_X = (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \cdot [(-1)^l \cdot (-1)]
   \]  
   Since \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \), the parity condition requires:  
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{\text{final}} + l + 1} = 1
   \]  
   This simplifies to:  
   \[
   L_{\text{final}} + l \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)
   \]

   - **Option A: \( 1S_0 \to 7D_1 + p \)**  
     Final NN state: \( 7D_1 \), with \( S_{\text{NN}} = 3 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \).  
     Emitted particle: \( p \), with \( l = 1 \).  
     - Parity: \( L_{\text{final}} = 2 \) (even), so \( P_{\text{NN, final}} = 1 \). Total parity after emission: \( 1 \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which does not match \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \).  
     - Pauli condition: \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 3 + 2 = 5 \) (odd), so \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \) is satisfied.  
     - **Conclusion**: Parity condition fails. Not allowed.

   - **Option B: \( 1S_0 \to 3S_1 + p \)**  
     Final NN state: \( 3S_1 \), with \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 0 \).  
     Emitted particle: \( p \), with \( l = 1 \).  
     - Parity: \( L_{\text{final}} = 0 \) (even), so \( P_{\text{NN, final}} = 1 \). Total parity after emission: \( 1 \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which does not match \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \).  
     - Pauli condition: \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 0 = 1 \) (odd), so \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \) is satisfied.  
     - **Conclusion**: Parity condition fails. Not allowed.

   - **Option C: \( 1S_0 \to 3D_3 + f \)**  
     Final NN state: \( 3D_3 \), with \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \).  
     Emitted particle: \( f \), with \( l = 3 \).  
     - Parity: \( L_{\text{final}} = 2 \) (even), so \( P_{\text{NN, final}} = 1 \). Total parity after emission: \( 1 \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which does not match \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \).  
     - Pauli condition: \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 2 = 3 \) (odd), so \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \) is satisfied.  
     - **Conclusion**: Parity condition fails. Not allowed.

   - **Option D: \( 1S_0 \to 3P_0 + s \)**  
     Final NN state: \( 3P_0 \), with \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \).  
     Emitted particle: \( s \), with \( l = 0 \).  
     - Parity: \( L_{\text{final}} = 1 \) (odd), so \( P_{\text{NN, final}} = -1 \). Total parity after emission: \( (-1) \cdot (-1) = 1 \), which matches \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \).  
     - Pauli condition: \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 1 = 2 \) (even), so \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \) is **not** satisfied.  
     - **Conclusion**: Pauli condition fails. Not allowed.

4. **Final Answer**:  
   All options fail either the parity condition or the Pauli condition. However, the problem specifies that one partial wave is not permitted. Based on the analysis, **Option D** is the only one that fails the Pauli condition despite satisfying the parity condition.

**Answer: D**
