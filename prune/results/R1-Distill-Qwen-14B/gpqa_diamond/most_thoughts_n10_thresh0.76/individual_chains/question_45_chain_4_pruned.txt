Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me start by recalling what I know about particles in a 1D infinite potential well.

First, each particle is a spin-1/2, which means they have spin up or down. But wait, in this scenario, since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system. So their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a single particle in state n is given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which is given as E in the problem. So E = (π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which means each particle's energy levels are multiples of E. For example, n=1 gives energy E, n=2 gives 4E, n=3 gives 9E, and so on.

Since we have four particles, and they're all spin-1/2, each can have a spin of either up or down. But because they're fermions, each unique spatial state can hold two particles (with opposite spins). So, the spatial part of the wavefunction must be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, and vice versa.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The Pauli exclusion principle says that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The total wavefunction is the product of the spatial part and the spin part. So, if the spin part is symmetric, the spatial part must be antisymmetric, and vice versa.

So, for four particles, we need to find their arrangement in the energy levels, considering the Pauli principle. Let me think about the possible ways to fill the states.

Each energy level can hold two particles (since spin up and down are possible). So the first energy level (n=1) can hold two, the second (n=2) can hold two, and so on.

But wait, four particles—so maybe the first two levels are filled. Let me think about the ground state first.

In the ground state, the lowest energy configuration is when the particles are in the lowest possible spatial orbitals, with spins arranged to satisfy the Pauli principle.

So for four spin-1/2 particles, how do their quantum numbers and spins arrange?

Let's think about the spatial wavefunction first. The particles are identical fermions, so the spatial part must be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, or symmetric if the spin part is antisymmetric.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the particles are filled into the orbitals. Each spatial orbital (n) can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, the lowest energy would be when they fill the first two spatial orbitals (n=1 and n=2), each with two particles.

Wait, but in a 1D well, each spatial state is characterized by a principal quantum number n. So the first orbital (n=1) can hold two particles (opposite spins). The second orbital (n=2) can hold two more, making four in total.

But wait, no, because with four particles, you can't all be in the lowest two orbitals. Because each orbital can hold two, yes, but for four particles, you could have two orbitals filled.

Wait, no, that's correct. n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two, that's four.

So in the ground state, the particles are arranged as two in n=1 (spins up and down) and two in n=2 (spins up and down). So the spatial wavefunction is the product of the individual spatial states, but the overall symmetry depends on the arrangement.

But wait, maybe I'm complicating things. The total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. So each particle in n=1 contributes E, each in n=2 contributes 4E.

So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2, the total energy would be 2E (from n=1) + 2*(4E) (from n=2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, wait no. Wait, each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two particles contribute 2E. Each in n=2 contributes 4E, so two contribute 8E. So total is 2E + 8E = 10E. Hmm, but looking at the options, option B has a ground state of 4E, but
