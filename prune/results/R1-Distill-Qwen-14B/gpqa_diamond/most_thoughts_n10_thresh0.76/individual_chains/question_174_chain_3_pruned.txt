Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is about an atomic nucleus that undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. I'm supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical approximation.

Wait, the nucleus is initially at rest, right? So the total initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Oh, right, because the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after the split must also be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let me think. Let me denote the rest masses. Let me say the less massive fragment has mass m, so the more massive one is 2m. Wait, but actually, the problem says the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. Oh, because M is the initial rest mass, and the nucleus is at rest.

So M_initial = M, and after fission, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So:

m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

And since one is twice the other, let's say m1 = 2m2? Wait, no, the more massive is twice as massive as the other. So let me think: the more massive fragment has mass 2m, the other has m. So m +
