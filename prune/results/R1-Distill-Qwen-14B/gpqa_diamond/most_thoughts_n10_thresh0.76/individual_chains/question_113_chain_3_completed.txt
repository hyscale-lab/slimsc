Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me start by looking at the FTIR data. It says there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Oh right, broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So that suggests the compound has an -OH group. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. I remember that 1700 is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, like in a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. The 1650 cm^-1 could be another carbonyl, maybe in a conjugated system or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl, or it could be an aromatic ring with some substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide or something else, but considering the other data, probably another carbonyl group.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks for vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule probably has a double bond, maybe part of a conjugated system or an aromatic ring. Wait, but vinyl hydrogens could also be in an isolated double bond. Hmm.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Okay, 45 is a common fragment. I think 45 could be a methyl group attached to something else, like a ketone (like (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, but that's m/z 58). Alternatively, maybe a methoxy group? No, methoxy is OCH3, which would be 31. Wait, another possibility: the fragment at 45 could be CH3CO+ (m/z 45). Because CH3CO has a molecular weight of 45. So if the compound has an ester group, perhaps ethyl acetate or something similar. Or maybe an acetyl group attached somewhere.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

The degree of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no info on X or N, assuming they're zero.

For each option:

A) C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one ring or double bond or a carbonyl group.

But wait, the FTIR has two peaks in the carbonyl region, so maybe two carbonyl groups. So DoU should be at least 2. So let me recalculate. Oh wait, the formula with O doesn't directly affect DoU. So for A: DoU is (2*6 +2 -12 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So only one degree of unsaturation, which would be a carbonyl and something else, maybe. Hmm, but two carbonyl groups would require two DoU. So maybe the formula isn't correct. Or perhaps one of the groups is a ring and a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. The formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For each molecule:

Option A: C6H12O2.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. But from IR, we have two carbonyls which require two DoU. So perhaps this is not possible. Hmm.

Option B: C6H10O.
DoU= (2*6 +2 -10 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could be two carbonyls or a ring and a carbonyl, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2.
DoU= (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2=(14-10)/2=2. Same as B.

Option D: C6H12O.
DoU = (2*6+2 -12 -0)/2=(14-12)/2=1. Again, only one DoU.

Wait, but the IR shows two strong peaks in the carbonyl region, which suggests two C=O groups. So the molecule should have two carbonyl groups, which would contribute two DoU. So the correct formula should have at least two DoU.

Looking back, options B and C have DoU=2, which fits. So A and D can be eliminated because they have DoU=1. So possible options are B and C.

Now, option B is C6H10O. So it has a formula with 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and one oxygen. Could that have two carbonyls? Because each carbonyl (like ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) takes up a DoU. Two carbonyls would require two DoU, but B has DoU=2, which is okay.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule has a double bond. Each double bond is another DoU. Hmm, but if the molecule already has two DoU (from two carbonyls), adding a double bond (another DoU) would make the total three. But the formula for option B has DoU=2. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the two carbonyls and a ring? Because a ring is another DoU. So two DoU: one ring and one carbonyl. But the IR shows two carbonyl peaks, so maybe two carbonyls. So that would require DoU=2, plus a double bond or ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

If the molecule has two carbonyl groups, that's two DoU. If it also has a double bond, that's another DoU, making three. But for option B, DoU is 2. So that's not enough. So perhaps the structure is such that the two carbonyls are conjugated with the double bond, making it one DoU for the conjugated system. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which would have a ring (DoU=1) and an ester group (another DoU). But then the DoU would be 2, which matches option B. But wait, if the ring is formed by the ester, that's a lactone. Then, the IR would show a carbonyl peak for the ester. But in the IR data, there are two carbonyl peaks. So maybe the molecule has two carbonyl groups, which would require two DoU, but the formula must have DoU of 2 or more.

Wait, but looking again, option C is C6H10O2. Its DoU is 2 as well. So same issue as B.

Wait, maybe the two carbonyls are part of an anhydride or something else. Alternatively, perhaps one is a ketone and the other is an ester. So for each carbonyl group, one DoU. So two in total.

In that case, the structure might be an ester with a ketone group, or an ester and another ester group, but that seems unusual.

Alternatively, the two carbonyls could be part of a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would account for one DoU for the conjugated double bond and one for the carbonyl. So in that case, two DoU. So that would fit into a formula with DoU=2.

So perhaps the structure is something like an ester with a conjugated double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would fit with the NMR showing vinyl hydrogens.

Now, looking back at the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. As I thought earlier, that's probably CH3CO+ (acetyl group). So if the molecule has an acetyl group, that fits.

So, if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, such as methyl acrylate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a substituted ester.

Wait, but the molecular formulas are all for six carbons. So, for example, something like methyl vinyl ketone would be C5H8O, but that doesn't match any of the options. Or perhaps something with two carbonyl groups.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2, which has a molecular weight of 6*12 + 10*1 + 2*16 = 72 +10 +32= 114. The mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45, which is about 40% of that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diester, but that would have more oxygen.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) with no double bonds. But then, where would the vinyl hydrogens come from? Because the NMR shows vinyl H's, which are from a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. Possible structures: maybe a cyclic ketone with a double bond (like cyclohexenone). But then, the O is in a ketone group. But the IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1 (ketone), but what about the 1650 cm^-1? That might be a conjugated double bond. So maybe a cyclohexenone derivative, but I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So perhaps an ester with a double bond. For example, something like methyl vinyl acetate but that would have more carbons. Or perhaps an ester with a conjugated double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something with the structure CH2=CHCOO-R. Let's see, that would be like propenoate ester. So for example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which has 5 carbons (CH2=CHCOOCH3). Wait, that's 5 carbons. Oh, but our compound has 6 carbons. So maybe the ester is part of a six-carbon chain.

Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond, but that might complicate things.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=1. So maybe a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. But that would require two DoU, which this formula doesn't have. So probably not.

Wait, going back to the NMR: presence of vinyl H's suggests a double bond. So the structure must have a double bond. So the molecule must have at least one DoU from that. Plus, the two carbonyls. So that's three DoU. But the formula for option B and C have DoU=2. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in DoU calculation. Let me recalculate.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = [2*C +2 - H - X + N]/2.

So (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. So that can account for two carbonyls and a ring, or a double bond and a carbonyl. Wait, but if it has a double bond and a carbonyl, that's two DoU. But the IR shows two carbonyls, so that would require two DoU from the carbonyls, plus the double bond for another DoU, making three. But the formula only has two DoU. So that's impossible.

Hmm, perhaps the double bond is conjugated with one of the carbonyls, which would mean that the conjugated system counts as one DoU instead of two. So if the molecule has a conjugated C=C and a carbonyl, that's two DoU. But in that case, the IR would show peaks in the 1650 and 1700 regions because the conjugated carbonyl might have a lower wavenumber. So for example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would have a carbonyl around 1700 and the conjugated double bond might affect the stretching.

Wait, but the IR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the molecule has a conjugated system, perhaps one peak is from the carbonyl and the other from an aromatic ring, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the two carbonyls are not conjugated. For example, one is an ester and the other is a ketone.

Wait, but the options only have one O, two O's, etc. Let me think again.

Option C: C6H10O2. So two O's. DoU=2.

Two carbonyls would take two DoU, so maybe that's the case. So the molecule could have two carbonyl groups, such as an ester and a ketone, but that would require a structure with those two groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbonyls are part of a cyclic structure. Or maybe one is an ester and the other an ether, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, the mass spec fragment is 45. If it's an ester, the acylium ion (CH3CO+) would be at 45. So if the molecule is an ester, it's likely. So in that case, the molecule would have an ester group (O-CO-O), which would contribute to the IR peak at 1700 cm^-1.

So let's think about an ester with another carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. So the molecule would have two carbonyl groups: one from the ester and one from a ketone. That would account for the two IR peaks. Also, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond elsewhere.

But wait, let's think about the molecular formula. For option C, C6H10O2. So 6 carbons, two oxygen. So perhaps an ester (which is O and another O from the carbonyl) and a ketone (another O). Wait, but ester is O-CO-O, so that's two O's. Wait, no. The ester functional group has two O's: one from the carbonyl (C=O) and one from the oxygen in the ester linkage (O-CO-O-R). So in an ester, O is two. So if the molecule has an ester and a ketone, that would be three O's. But option C has only two O's. So that's not possible.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps the two carbonyls are part of the same group. Like a cyclic anhydride, but that's O as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe one of the carbonyls is an acid. But that's not an ester. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a beta-diketone, but that would require two ketone groups. But then O would be two as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the two carbonyls are from a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. So taking one oxygen.

Wait, but let me think of a specific structure. For option C: C6H10O2. Let's say it's an ester with an alpha,beta-unsaturated group. So maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2- something? Wait, but that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. What's the molecular weight? 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 114. If the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45, which is 45/114 ≈ 0.39. So the fragment is about 40% of the molecular ion. That could suggest a stable fragment, like the acetyl group.

So if the molecule is something like methyl vinyl ether or an ester with a vinyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is methyl propenoate. Wait, propenoate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH3, which is methyl acrylate. Its formula is C4H6O2. But the options have C6H10O2 or C6H10O, etc. So that's four carbons, not six.

Wait, perhaps it's a diester? Or maybe a larger ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted ester with a longer chain.

Wait, another possibility: the IR shows two carbonyl peaks. One at 1700 and another at 1650. That could indicate two different types of carbonyl groups. For instance, an ester (around 1700) and a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (which might be lower in wavenumber, so 1650 cm^-1). So the molecule would have both an ester and a ketone group. But with two oxygens, that's possible.

Wait, but that would require three oxygens: one for the ester (two O's in the ester group) and one for the ketone O. But the formula for option C is two O's. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the two carbonyls are part of a single group, like an anhydride. But an anhydride would have two carbonyls and three oxygen atoms. So that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the two carbonyl groups are part of a cyclic structure. For example, a cyclic ketone and another group.

Alternatively, maybe one of the carbonyls is part of a conjugated system, and the other is an aromatic ring, but that doesn't fit with the NMR data showing vinyl hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a conjugated diene and a carbonyl group. But then the IR would show only one carbonyl peak, not two.

Wait, maybe the carbonyl at 1650 is due to an aromatic ring with substituents, like a carbonyl group attached to an aromatic ring. But then the other carbonyl is, say, an ester. But that would require more oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a lactone. Lactone is a cyclic ester, which has one carbonyl group. That would account for one of the IR peaks. So where's the second carbonyl?

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. So 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O. Suppose the structure is an ester with a double bond. Let's think of a structure like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's a saturated ester. Alternatively, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in the ester. Hmm. Or perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's seven carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted ester with a double bond. Maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's more than six carbons.

Wait, maybe it's a six-carbon compound where the ester is part of a ring. Like a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But a lactone would only have one carbonyl group. So that doesn't explain the two IR peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a diester, like a succinic acid ester, but that would have more oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have one carbonyl. So that wouldn't account for the two IR peaks.

Wait, maybe the two IR peaks are due to different types of carbonyls, such as an ester and a ketone. But with only two oxygens, that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is not present, but another functional group. I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the second carbonyl is due to an aromatic ring, like in an aromatic ketone, but that's more stretching.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an adjacent double bond. Wait, but that would have one carbonyl and the double bond would be conjugated, perhaps reducing the wavenumber. But then, where's the second carbonyl?

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the mass spec fragment.

The fragment at m/z=45 is CH3CO+ (45). So the molecule must have an acetyl group. So perhaps the structure is an ester derived from acetic acid. So the molecule would have an -OAc group (OAc is O-CO-CH3). So, for example, if it's an ester like ethyl acetoacetate, but that's a beta-keto ester and has two carbonyl groups. Let me check the formula.

Ethyl acetoacetate is CH3COCH2COOEt. Let's count:

CH3 (2 C), CO (1 C), CH2 (1 C), COOEt (3 C: COO and Et is C2H5, so 3 C in the ester part? Let me structure it:

(CH3)COCH2COOCH2CH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-COO-CH2CH3.

That's 6 carbons in total. The formula would be C6H10O3. Because:

Each CH3 is 1 C, CO is 1, CH2 is 1, COO is 2, and CH2CH3 is 2. So 1+1+1+2+2 =7? No. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, (CH3)COCH2COOCH2CH3: that's (CH3) (1 C), CO (1 C), CH2 (1 C), CO (1 C), O, then OCH2CH3 (which is 2 C). So 1+1+1+1+2=6 C. Correct. Now, H:

(CH3): 3 H, CO doesn't add H, CH2: 2 H, COO: the ester group doesn't add H, OCH2CH3 has 5 H. Wait, let's sum. The structure is:

(CH3)COCH2COOCH2CH3.

Breaking it down:

Each group:

- (CH3): 3 H.
- CO: doesn't add H.
- CH2: 2 H.
- COO: ester group, so the O's don't add H.
- OCH2CH3: (CH2CH3) has 5 H (2 in CH2, 3 in CH3).

Wait, but wait: the ester group is O-CO-O. So the structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)O-CH2CH3.

Wait, no. No, wait: ethyl acetoacetate is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Ethyl acetoacetate is actually:

CH3C(O)CH2COOEt. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would have four carbons from the acetoacetate part (CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)) and the ester part (O-CH2CH3). So total 4+2=6 carbons. So the formula would be:

Each CH3: 1 C, each C=O: 1 C, CH2: 1 C, O-CH2CH3: 2 C. So 1+1+1+1+2=6 C, correct.

Hydrogens:

CH3: 3 H.

Each CH2: 2 H each. There are three CH2 groups? Let me count:

- CH3 (3 H)
- C(=O) (no H)
- CH2 (2 H)
- C(=O) (no H)
- OCH2CH3 (5 H: 2 in CH2, 3 in CH3)

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the molecular formula properly.

Ethyl acetoacetate: C5H8O3? No, wait:

Each CH3 group: 1 C, 3 H.

Each C=O: no H.

CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

COOEt: the ester group is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. So for the ester group:

O-CO-O-CH2CH3: that's 3 O's, and the ethyl group is 2 C, 5 H (CH2CH3).

So putting it all together:

Molecule: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3.

So carbons: 2 (from CH3 and C=O) + 1 (CH2) + 2 (from the other C=O) + 2 (from OCH2CH3) = 2+1+2+2=7? Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount.

Wait, acetoacetate is:

The acetoacetate ion is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-O-.

When esterified with ethanol (EtOH), it becomes CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3.

So:

- CH3: 1 C, 3 H.
- C(=O): 1 C, 0 H.
- CH2: 1 C, 2 H.
- C(=O): 1 C, 0 H.
- O-CH2CH3: 2 C, 5 H.

So total C: 1 +1 +1 +1 +2 =6 C.

H: 3 (CH3) + 2 (CH2) +5 (OCH2CH3)=10 H.

O: 3 O (from two C=O and one O in ester linkage) plus another O in the ester group? Wait, the structure is O-CO-O. So that's two O's from COO and another O in the linkage. So total O is 3? So the formula would be C6H10O3. But our options don't have O3. So that can't be the structure we're looking at.

Hmm. So perhaps the compound isn't a beta-keto ester. But I was thinking in terms of the fragment at 45.

Wait, maybe it's a different ester. Let's think of another structure. For example, methyl propenoate: CH2=CHCOOCH3.

That's C4H6O2. But our options are for C6. So perhaps a larger ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like diethyl maleate or something else. Wait, diethyl maleate is (CH2CH2O)2C(COOH)CH2CH2O. Hmm, but that has more oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a vinyl group, like methyl vinyl ester. But that would require a specific structure.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula. Let's take option C: C6H10O2.

The formula has 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.

If it's an ester, the general formula is CnH2nO2. Wait, but for an ester derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, RCOOR', the formula is (n+1) C, 2n+2 H, 2 O. Wait, let's think: R is m carbons, R' is p carbons. Then the ester RCOOR' has (m+1+p) C, (2m + 2p +2) H, 2 O.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the degree of unsaturation for an ester. For an ester, RCOOR', the DoU is for the carbonyl (1) and any double bonds or rings in R and R'. So if the ester group itself contributes one DoU, then the rest of the structure can add more.

In our case, the compound has two DoU according to the formula. So the ester contributes one, the other could be a double bond or a ring. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

So, perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond. Let's consider a structure with five carbons in the ester. No, wait, let's make it fit the formula.

For example, if R is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3, but that's a longer chain. Maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone). But a lactone would have only one carbonyl.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Such as CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But that's five carbons in the ester.

Wait, but that would be:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: that's 2 (from CH2=CHCOO) + 3 (from OCH2CH2CH3) = 5 carbons. But the formula is C6H10O2. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a six-carbon chain with a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a four-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. But that's probably not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted ester with a double bond, such as a vinyl ester. For example, methyl vinyl ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that's five carbons (CH2=CHCOO is four, CH3 is one, total five). So formula would be C5H8O2. But our compound is C6H10O2. So one more carbon and two more hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps it's ethyl vinyl ester: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's 6 carbons (CH2=CHCOO is four, OCH2CH3 is two, total six). Let's calculate the formula:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3: 6 C, H? Let's count:

CH2=CHCOO has 4 carbons and 5 H (CH2=CH has 3 H, COO has no H, but the chain is CH2=CHCOO-), wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the H count.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a saturated ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diester, but that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps I should stop trying to find the exact structure and instead think about the options and the data.

So, the options are:

A) C6H12O2 (DoU=1)
B) C6H10O (DoU=2)
C) C6H10O2 (DoU=2)
D) C6H12O (DoU=1)

We've already determined that the molecule has two carbonyl groups (from IR) and a double bond (from NMR). So that requires three DoU. But options B and C have only two DoU each. So that's a problem. So perhaps my earlier analysis is incorrect.

Wait, wait, perhaps the two carbonyl peaks are not from two separate groups but from a conjugated system. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have one carbonyl, but perhaps two peaks due to different conjugation effects. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbonyls is an aromatic ring, but that would require a benzene ring, which would have more DoU.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a conjugated diene and a carbonyl group. So the IR would show one carbonyl peak, but the data shows two.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let's try another approach.

The mass spec fragment at 45 is CH3CO+. So the molecule has an acetyl group. So the formula must include an acetyl group. The molecular formula would then have a CH3CO part.

Looking at the options:

Option C is C6H10O2. If the molecule has an acetyl group (CH3CO), that's 2 C and 3 H. The remaining would be 4 C, 7 H, 2 O. Hmm.

So perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-R, where R is a four-carbon group with a double bond. Let's see:

CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Let's see:

This would be an ester, CH3COOCH2CH=CH2.

So, the formula would be:

CH3: 2 C, 3 H.

O.

OCH2CH=CH2: 3 C, 5 H (CH2: 2, CH2: 2, CH2: 0? Wait, no: CH2CH=CH2 has CH2 (2 H), CH=CH2 (3 H). So total H in R group: 2 (from CH2) + 3 (from CH=CH2) =5. Plus the acetyl's 3 H, but wait, the ester would have:

CH3COO- group: 2 C, 3 H.

Then the R group is CH2CH=CH2: 3 C, 5 H.

So total C: 2+3=5. But our compound has 6 C. So perhaps the R group is longer.

Alternatively, R is CH2CH2CH=CH2. Wait, no, that's four C. So CH3COO-CH2CH2CH=CH2.

That would be 2 (from acetyl) +4 (from R)=6 C. So formula is C6H10O2.

Hydrogen count:

Acetyl: 3 H.

O.

R: CH2CH2CH=CH2.

CH2CH2CH=CH2: each CH2 group has 2 H, CH=CH2 has 3 H (each CH has 1 H, and the CH2 has 2 H? Wait: CH2-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, structure is:

CH2CH2CH=CH2: that's four C.

Breaking it down:

CH2 (2 H), CH2 (2 H), CH (1 H), CH2 (2 H). Wait, but wait, the actual structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So the H's would be:

- CH2: 2 H,
- CH2: 2 H,
- CH= (1 H),
- CH2: 2 H.

So total in R: 2+2+1+2=7 H.

Plus the acetyl's 3 H: total H=10. And O's: 2.

So the formula is C6H10O2, which matches option C.

The IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1. The other peak at 1650 cm^-1 could be from the double bond (C=C) which is conjugated with the ester group, shifting its absorption to a lower wavenumber. So the two peaks in IR would be the ester carbonyl and the conjugated C=C.

The 1H NMR would show peaks for the vinyl H's in the CH=CH2 group. And the mass spec would show a fragment at m/z=45 corresponding to the acetyl group (CH3CO+).

So putting it all together, the correct formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group.
- Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of two carbonyl (C=O) groups. The peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an ester or ketone, while the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or a double bond.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicates the presence of a double bond in the molecule.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is consistent with the acetyl group (CH₃CO⁺).

### Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):
The degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H - X + N}{2}
\]
For the given options:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 1
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1

The FTIR data indicates two carbonyl groups, which require **two DoU**. Options **A** and **D** are eliminated because they only have **one DoU**. This leaves **B** and **C** as possible candidates.

### Mass Spectrometry and Structure:
The fragment at **m/z = 45** corresponds to the acetyl group (CH₃CO⁺), suggesting the molecule contains an ester group. The NMR data confirms the presence of a double bond, as indicated by the vinyl hydrogens.

### Final Structure and Formula:
Option **C (C₆H₁₀O₂)** fits the data:
- The molecule contains two carbonyl groups (one from the ester and one from a conjugated system), consistent with the IR peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹.
- The double bond accounts for the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum.
- The molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** matches the degree of unsaturation (2) and the presence of an ester group.

Thus, the unknown compound is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.
