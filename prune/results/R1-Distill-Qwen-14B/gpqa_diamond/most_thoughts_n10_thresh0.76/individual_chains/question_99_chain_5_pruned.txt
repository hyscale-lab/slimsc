Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectroscopic data given. Let me start by reading the question carefully and then breaking it down step by step.

The compound is an unknown, and we've got two characterization techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. Let's look at the data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching because of hydrogen bonding, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Then there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a typical carbonyl group (C=O) absorption. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid since those have both O-H and C=O groups. The broadness at 3000 could be from the O-H in the carboxylic acid.

Now, the 1H NMR data. There are several signals, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, like in alkenes. That might mean the molecule is more saturated, perhaps branched or with rings but without any double bonds.

Looking at the splitting patterns: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's complex splitting. Splitting in NMR arises from neighboring (vicinal) protons. The more neighboring Hs, the more splitting you get. So those complex patterns probably come from protons next to multiple sets of equivalent Hs.

The options given are four different compounds, all carboxylic acids since they end with COOH. Let me write them out to visualize:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, let me parse that correctly. The structure is perhaps something like (CH3)(C2H5)CH-C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH? Oh wait, maybe it's more like a geminal di-substitution. Let me think.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So it's something like:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain? Or maybe a geminal di-substitution on the third carbon?

Wait, perhaps each of these is a gem-dimethyl group. Let me try to structure each option.

Option A: The formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. That would be a structure where the central carbons have two substituents each. Maybe like:

CH2CH2 group attached to a CH(C2H5) group, which is attached to another CH(C2H5), then CH2COOH. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Hmm, maybe the structure is more like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about each option.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So that would be:

CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the chain is longer, with substituents on the adjacent carbons before the COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So that's:

(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2COOH? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. So the structure is
