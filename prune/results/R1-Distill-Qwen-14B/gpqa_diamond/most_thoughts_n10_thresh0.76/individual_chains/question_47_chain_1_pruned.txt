Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

The compound is C9H11NO2. The molecular formula has 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. Let me jot that down: C9H11NO2.

Looking at the IR data first. The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or amine. The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a good clue. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably from an amide or ester. Wait, because amides typically have lower wavenumbers (like around 1650-1680), but maybe it's an ester. Or a ketone? No, because the molecular formula has two O's and includes an amide or ester group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded. The triplet suggests it's next to another CH2 group. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, two hydrogens. Could be an NH2 group, but then we have other signals. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group. But the broadness might suggest some exchange, like an amide NH. Wait, but the molecular formula only has one N, so maybe an OCH2 next to a substituent?
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet usually comes from a CH2 next to another CH2 that's split into a quartet. Like in an ethyl group where one CH2 is next to another. Wait, but the ethyl group is typically at 1.20 (t) and 4.0 (q). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, 4.5 could be a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom, like O. For example, in an ester group, the OCH2CO structure. Wait, OCH2CO would have the OCH2 as a quartet if the adjacent CH2 is split by coupling. But wait, I'm a bit confused here.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Those are two doublets, each integrating for two protons. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two protons in the ortho positions and two in the para, but wait, no, two doublets each with 2H would imply two sets of two protons. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. For example, if the ring has two substituents opposite each other, each set of
