Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are hints and options provided, so I'll need to use all the information given.

Let me start by breaking down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

So, let's think about each step and what kind of compounds we're dealing with.

First, the IR peaks. The strong peak around 1750 cm^-1 in compound A suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an aldehyde or maybe an ester or something else. Since A reacts with HCN, which is a nucleophile, probably A is a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups.

Wait, HCN addition to a carbonyl would give a cyanohydrin. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation, it would reduce any double bonds. But wait, the cyanohydrin is a secondary alcohol adjacent to a nitrile group. Hmm, so perhaps the reduction would reduce the nitrile to an amine? No, wait, nitriles upon hydrogenation typically become amines, but with H2 and Pd, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation. So nitrile (CN) would become CH2NH2, but under certain conditions, it might be reduced to an amine.

Wait, maybe I should think about each step more carefully.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.

If A is a ketone, then HCN would add to the carbonyl, producing a cyanohydrin. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Step 2: B (cyanohydrin) is reduced with H2 and Pd. So, what's in B? Let's imagine B is R-C(OH)-CN. When we hydrogenate this, the nitrile group (CN) would get reduced. Nitriles (RCN) upon hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically become RCH2NH2, but wait, that's more like a primary amine. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the cyanohydrin has a structure like R-C(OH)-CH2-CN. No, wait, the cyanohydrin addition to a ketone would be R2C(OH)CN. So the structure would be a secondary alcohol with an adjacent nitrile.

Hydrogenation of nitriles: In presence of H2 and a catalyst like Pd, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine. So R-C(OH)-CH2-NH2? Or perhaps it's reduced all the way to R-CH2-CH2-NH2? Not sure.

Wait, wait. Another thought: Maybe the reduction isn't of the nitrile, but of some other functional group. But what else is in B? There's an alcohol and a nitrile. H2 and Pd are usually for hydrogenation of double bonds. But the cyanohydrin doesn't have a double bond; it's a single bond. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the compound B is not a cyanohydrin. Alternative possibility: when a ketone reacts with HCN, it can form a cyanohydrin. But another possibility is that if the ketone is cyclic, like cyclohexanone, the addition could lead to a bicyclic structure or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A isn't a ketone but an aldehyde. But aldehydes would react similarly, producing a cyanohydrin (RCH2-OH adjacent to CN). But then in the next step, reduction would again affect the nitrile.

Wait, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) is converted into a methylene group (CH2) upon hydrogenation. Because, under certain conditions, like catalytic hydrogenation, the nitrile (RCN) can be reduced to RCH2NH2, but sometimes it's done in stages. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the nitrile is being hydrogenated all the way to a methylene group. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps the nitrile is converted to an amine, and then further hydrogenated. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is of a double bond elsewhere. Wait, but B is a cyanohydrin, which doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of compound C. If B is a cyanohydrin, and upon reduction you get compound C. Let's imagine the structure.

Suppose A is a cyclohexanone. Then, reacting with HCN would give a cyanohydrin: cyclohexane with a hydroxyl and nitrile group adjacent.
