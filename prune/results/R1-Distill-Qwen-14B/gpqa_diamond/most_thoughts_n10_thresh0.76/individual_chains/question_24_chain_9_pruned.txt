Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think through it.

The problem says there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Wait, what does decolorizing bromine mean? Oh right, that usually means the substance has double bonds because alkenes can add to bromine, causing it to decolorize. So mixture X has two liquids with double bonds, maybe alkenes or possibly something else like conjugated dienes? But the problem also says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X. So each molecule in X has a single double bond, not conjugated. So each is an alkene or maybe an alkyne? No, wait, alkyne hydrogenation would probably form alkanes, but I'm not sure yet.

When mixture X is treated with platinum and heat, a mixture Y is formed via disproportionation. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but mixture X is two liquids, and Y is also two liquids. So maybe each component of X disproportionates into two components in Y?

But wait, the problem says that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So the products don't have double bonds anymore. That makes sense because if X had alkenes, after hydrogenation (with Pt and heat), those would become alkanes, which don't have double bonds. But since Y is formed via disproportionation, perhaps the reaction isn't just addition hydrogenation. Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The mixture X is treated with Pt when heated, and forms Y, which is a mixture after a disproportionation reaction. So maybe each component of X is being split into two different compounds in Y through a disproportionation. Hmm. Another possibility is that each component of X undergoes some redox reaction, but I'm not entirely sure yet.

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they only give one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon, with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Let me calculate that. So the hydrogen mass is 14.28%, which is 0.1428. So the molecular formula must have a certain ratio of C and H.

Wait, 1
