Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After the reaction, the TLC showed the reactant spot decreased and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which products are formed from the options given.

Hmm, let me think about what's going on here. The starting material is a benzene ring with an ether group. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is like benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but there's a double bond in there. Oh right, but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, let me clarify.

But-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no. Wait, the butenyl group is four carbons. So numbering from the oxygen, which is the first carbon. So the structure is O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2, but wait, no, wait. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the group is O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me draw it out.

But-3-en-1-yl: So the four carbons are 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4. Wait, no, butenyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond. So 3-en means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, right? So the substituent is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that's butyl. No, with a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O- attached to benzene.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 3 and 4? Wait, but but has four
