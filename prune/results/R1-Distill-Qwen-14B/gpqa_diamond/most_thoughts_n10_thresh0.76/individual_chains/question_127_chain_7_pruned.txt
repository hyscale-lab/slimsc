Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, wait, what's that structure look like? Let me draw it out mentally. Nonane means nine carbons. The diene is at positions 2 and 6. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, nona-2,6-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me count. I think the positions are 2 and 6, so the double bonds are between C2-C3 and C6-C7.

But wait, wait, the name is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Oh right, the substituents are important. So the main chain is nine carbons, and there's a butyl group attached at the 5th carbon. So the structure should be: 

Carbon chain from 1 to 9. The double bonds are between 2-3 and 6-7. The substituent is a butyl group on carbon 5.

Wait, but butyl is four carbons. So the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2CH2- group attached to carbon 5. So the structure would be:

1: CH2-
2: CH2-
3: CH2-
4: CH2-
5: C connected to the substituent (butyl)
Wait, perhaps I should write it more clearly.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense because the main chain is nine, so the substituent is on carbon 5.

Wait, maybe the main chain is nine carbons, with double bonds at positions 2 and 6. The substituent is a butyl group on carbon 5.

So it's:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH2)-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH
