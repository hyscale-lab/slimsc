Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetic constructs. Hmm, I'll try to think through it step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves a bicistronic vector, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The ligand is placed at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Wait, CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's a cytomegalovirus enhancer with the beta-actin promoter. Then upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to the translation of the downstream ORF, even if the first one isn't translated much. So the ligand and receptor are both expressed from the same vector, but perhaps the ligand is under CBA and the receptor is under the control of the IRES.

Now, between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop with lox2272. Oh, I remember that loxP is a recombination site, and lox2272 is another variant. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and can mediate recombination, like deleting the floxed regions. So, if there's a stop in a loxP cassette, that might be a way to block expression unless the stop is removed via Cre.

The person made a bicistronic vector, and then raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Then they transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and tested expression via Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, which is a loading control. So the blot works and the proteins are being expressed in some way.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes maybe. After the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal. They expected to see green (from eGFP) but didn't. So why no green signal?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But this is about expression in the same cell? If the ligand is secreted and the receptor is on the cell surface, then perhaps they act paracrinely. But how does that affect GFP expression? If the construct isn't expressed, then no GFP. But in the mouse model, they're using SOX10-Cre, which should activate the construct in neural crest cells. So maybe the issue isn't about paracrine vs. autocrine.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So the protein isn't getting to the cell surface. If the eGFP is not expressed, or is retained, but in the Western blot, they might detect it if the antibody can see it even if it's in the ER or Golgi. Wait, the question says in the Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin loading. So the proteins are being expressed (since actin is a control). So if the receptor-eGFP is expressed but stuck in Golgi, would that prevent fluorescence? Possibly, but in the Western blot, the antibody against the receptor should detect it regardless of where it is in the cell. So the lack of GFP in the confocal could be due to the eGFP not being expressed. But why?

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. The receptor is under the IRES, which itself is a form of regulation, but IRES can drive expression in a cell-specific manner? Or maybe without an enhancer, the promoter isn't strong enough. But since the construct is in a mouse, and using SOX10-Cre, perhaps the construct is only active in neural crest cells. Wait, but the CBA promoter is strong, so maybe the enhancer being missing is a problem? But the ligand is under CBA, which is strong, and the receptor is under IRES, which relies on the upstream promoter. Hmm, maybe if the IRES isn't placed correctly, the receptor isn't expressed. But the question is about the eGFP not showing up.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, that's a big issue. If the ORF for the receptor is followed by eGFP without a stop in between, but both are in the same reading frame, then perhaps the receptor-eGFP is a fusion protein. But in the construct, the receptor is in a lox2272 cassette with a stop. Wait, the construct is ligand ORF (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry; and receptor (lox2272-stop-lox2272), then eGFP. So for the receptor, the stop is between it and eGFP. So without Cre, the stop remains, so the receptor is expressed as a separate ORF, and eGFP as another? Or is the eGFP in frame?

Wait, the way it's described: The ligand ORF is at 5', then stop, mCherry. Receptor ORF is at 3', with eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop cassette. So when Cre is present, the lox sites are recombined, and the stops are removed. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP. But wait, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and maybe the receptor from the IRES.

Wait, but the setup is that the vector is a bicistronic vector. So a single transcript is made, and the two ORFs are translated. The first ORF is ligand-mCherry, and the second is receptor-eGFP, but with stops in between. So the stops are flanked by lox sites, so without Cre, the stops are in place, preventing read-through. When Cre is present, the stops are removed, allowing for expression of the downstream genes.

But wait, the way the construct is described is: ligand ORF is at 5', followed by a stop in loxP cassette. Then mCherry. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Or are the ligand and mCherry separate? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop with loxP. Then the mCherry is after that. But without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Hmm, but the question says the ligand is under CBA and the receptor is under IRES. So the ligand's expression would be from the CBA promoter, and the receptor from the IRES, which is after the ligand's ORF. So maybe the construct is ligand (CBA-driven), then IRES, then receptor, which is followed by a stop with lox2272.

Wait, the setup says: the ligand is under CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the vector is CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> IRES -> receptor ORF -> eGFP. But between ligand and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette, and between receptor and eGFP is a stop in lox2272.

Wait, maybe it's like this: The construct is designed as CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> (loxP-stop-loxP) -> mCherry; and then IRES -> receptor ORF -> (lox2272-stop-lox2272) -> eGFP.

So when there's no Cre, the ligand will be expressed (from CBA), but the stop after ligand ORF will prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is under IRES, so maybe it's expressed, but the stop after receptor ORF would prevent eGFP from being expressed. But when Cre is present, the loxP sites are recognized, and the stops are removed. So with Cre, the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse model, they made it homozygous in the wild-type background. Then they crossed to SOX10-Cre. So the Cre would be active in the neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stops would be removed, and both ligand and mCherry, receptor and eGFP would be expressed. So the offspring would have the construct active in neural crest-derived cells, which should express the receptor-eGFP and ligand-mCherry.

But when they looked under the confocal, they didn't see green. So why? The possible issues are:

1. The receptor-eGFP is not expressed.

2. The eGFP is not functional (but the question says the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so perhaps eGFP is correctly expressed but not fluorescent for some reason).

But let's think about the possibility that the stop cassette wasn't properly removed. If the Cre didn't work, then the stops would remain, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why would the Cre not work?

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. They crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is a transgenic line. SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the construct would be in the neural crest cells, and Cre would be active there, so the lox sites would be recombined, and the stops removed.

So the question is, why is eGFP not expressed in the offspring?

Looking at the options again.

Option C says the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. If the CBA promoter isn't properly regulated, maybe the ligand and receptor aren't expressed. But the Western blot showed that the proteins were expressed in the transfected astrocytes. So the promoter probably works.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, the construct's receptor ORF is followed by a stop in lox2272. So when the stop is removed with Cre, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF, but in frame? Or are they in the same reading frame?

If the stop is removed, the eGFP is in frame with the receptor. So when translated, it's a fusion protein of receptor and eGFP. But that's okay, because eGFP is at the C-terminus. So the eGFP should be expressed as part of the receptor's C-terminus.

But if the two are not in frame, the eGFP won't be translated correctly. So the ORF of the receptor is followed by the eGFP, with a stop in between. So when you remove the stop, the reading frame must continue into eGFP. If they're not in the same frame, the eGFP won't be correctly expressed. But if the vectors were designed correctly, the reading frame should match.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor. So if the construct is correctly designed, the eGFP should be expressed. But if it's not, maybe the frameshift is causing a problem.

Wait, but the vector is designed with the receptor ORF followed by the eGFP, but with a stop in between. If the stop is flanked by lox sites, then upon Cre recombination, the stop is removed, and the eGFP is attached to the receptor without a stop. So the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor. So the eGFP would be expressed as a fusion protein.

But if the lox2272 is not compatible with the loxP (because lox2272 is a mutant), then the Cre cannot recombine. So the stop remains, and eGFP is not expressed. Because lox2272 is a variant that can't be recombined by wild-type Cre, but can be recombined by a modified Cre. Wait, no—lox2272 is a lox variant that can be used with Cre for recombination. Or perhaps lox2272 is a site that requires a different Cre version, like Dre or another recombinase.

Wait, loxP is the standard site for Cre. Lox2272 is a lox variant that has a different sequence but is still recognized by Cre. So if the vector has a loxP site upstream and a lox2272 downstream, and Cre is present, it can recombine them? Or does it require a different enzyme?

Wait, no—maybe the lox2272 is used in a different system. Oh, I think lox2272 is a site that is recognized by Cre, but it's a variant that can be used in specific systems. But in any case, Cre can recognize and recombine loxP and lox2272 sites. Wait, I might be getting confused. LoxP is 34 bp, and lox2272 is a 32 bp variant. They are both recognized by Cre.

So in the construct, the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP sites (for ligand), and the lox2272 sites (for receptor), thereby removing the stops.

So in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed as a fusion or as separate proteins? Wait, the ligand is in the 5' end, followed by stop cassette. So when Cre removes the stop, the ligand and mCherry would be co-expressed, but I'm not sure if they are in frame. If the ligand is fused to mCherry, that's possible. But if the ligand is followed by a stop, and the stop is removed, then the mCherry would be expressed as a separate ORF.

Wait, perhaps the ligand and mCherry are in a single transcript but separate ORFs, separated by a stop that is removed by Cre. So without Cre, only the ligand is expressed (with mCherry not expressed), because the stop is present. With Cre, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed as well.

Similarly, for the receptor, the stop after the receptor ORF is in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed after the receptor.

So in the mouse model, where Cre is active in neural crest cells, the stops are removed, and both mCherry and eGFP should be expressed.

But the confocal shows no green signal. So eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF of the receptor is not in frame with eGFP after the stop is removed, then the eGFP won't be correctly translated. So perhaps the eGFP is in a different reading frame, making it not expressed. But that would only happen if the design was incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame. If the stop is removed, but the reading frame shifts, then eGFP might not be expressed correctly. But the construct was designed with care, so probably the frames are correct.

Wait, another possibility: if the stop was not correctly flanked by lox sites, and the lox2272 doesn't recombine, the stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would the lox2272 not recombine? Because Cre isn't active, but in this case, the Cre is active in the neural crest cells.

Wait, another angle: maybe the SOX10-Cre line isn't active, but that's unlikely because the question states that the cross was done with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring should have Cre active in neural crest cells.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand and receptor. The problem arises when using the construct in the mouse. So perhaps the construct is not properly excised because the lox2272 and loxP are on different sites. Wait, perhaps the lox2272 is not compatible with Cre. Oh wait, lox2272 is a variant that can recombine with Cre. So the presence of Cre should remove the stops.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is not removed. If the stop remains, then the receptor is expressed, but not eGFP. So why would the stop remain? Maybe because the Cre isn't active. But in the mice, SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, which should induce Cre expression. So the construct should be recombined.

But if the vector has loxP and lox2272 sites, and Cre is active, the stops should be removed. So why is eGFP not expressed?

Looking at the options again. Option D is about the ORF being out of frame. So let's see, the receptor ORF is followed by eGFP, but without a stop in between. So if the stop is removed, the eGFP is in frame. If the eGFP is not in frame, then the entire ORF would have a frameshift, making the eGFP not expressed. So the construct would produce a non-functional eGFP, or none at all.

Wait, but the problem says that the person raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So when they transfected the construct into astrocytes and did a Western blot, they detected the proteins. So the Western blot worked, meaning that the proteins are expressed.

In the mouse, after Cre activation, the eGFP should be expressed in neural crest cells, allowing visualization under confocal. But no green. So why?

Another possibility: the eGFP is not being transported to the cell surface. But in the Western blot, the eGFP would still be detected as a cytoplasmic protein. So the Western would detect it. But if the eGFP is retained in the ER, for example, it's not fluorescent because it's not properly folded. But the question says the blot signal is proportional to actin, so the eGFP is being expressed, but perhaps not fluorescent. But the question is about the confocal, which looks for fluorescence, not the presence of eGFP in the cell.

Hmm, but the question states that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So the eGFP is expressed but not fluorescent. But the question is about the absence of green in the confocal.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the ORF is not correctly in frame.

Wait, if the lox2272-stop-lox2272 is in the construct, and the stop is removed, but the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, then the eGFP wouldn't be translated. Because the removal of the stop would allow the receptor's ORF to continue into the eGFP. If the reading frame is wrong, eGFP would not be expressed correctly.

So if the eGFP is not in frame, it won't be expressed. So the antibodies in the Western would only detect the receptor, not the eGFP. But the question says that the Western blot shows a signal proportional to actin loading, but it's unclear if it's the ligand or the receptor that's detected. Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot is just confirming that the proteins are expressed, but the confocal is about eGFP.

But the problem is about the lack of green in the confocal. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, then no green. So why isn't it expressed?

If the lox2272 sites aren't recombined, the stop remains. But why wouldn't they recombine? Because the Cre isn't active, but in the mouse, the Cre is active.

Another possibility is that the vector wasn't correctly recombined. Maybe the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. For Cre to recombine, the lox sites must be in a certain orientation (loxP and lox2272 in a specific arrangement). If they are in the wrong orientation, Cre won't delete the stop.

Wait, maybe the lox sites are arranged as lox2272-STOP-lox2272, and the Cre can't recombine that because it's a palindrome. No, lox sites are directional. Cre can only recombine them if they are in the correct orientation. So perhaps the lox sites are in a way that the stop isn't removed, hence eGFP isn't expressed.

But the vector was designed as ligand ORF (with loxP-stop-loxP), and receptor ORF (with lox2272-stop-lox2272). So when Cre recognizes the lox sites, it deletes the stops. But if the lox2272 sites are arranged in a way that the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, another thought: the lox2272 and loxP sites are different, but Cre can still recognize and recombine them. So the presence of Cre would cause the stops to be removed, regardless of the loxP or lox2272. But if the lox2272 sites are in a way that the recombination doesn't occur, perhaps due to a different orientation, the stop remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is a 'floxed' site that requires a different recombinase, but that's not the case here because it's the same Cre.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the lox2272 is in a different orientation. For example, the lox2272 sites are in the same direction, so when Cre is present, it doesn't delete the stop but instead flips it. Or perhaps the lox2272 sites are arranged as lox2272 before and after the stop, but in the same direction, so when Cre cuts, it just inverts the stop but doesn't remove it. So the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

If that's the case, then the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the confocal, no green.

But is this the case? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Looking at the options again:

Option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the CBA promoter is constitutive, so enhancer shouldn't matter.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if the stop is removed, but the ORF is such that eGFP is not in the same frame as the receptor, then eGFP isn't expressed. So the Western blot would detect the receptor but not eGFP, but the question says the signal is proportional to actin, which implies that the proteins are expressed. Hmm, but perhaps the antibody detects the receptor, which is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't being expressed, so the confocal doesn't show green.

So if the stop is removed, but eGFP is not in frame, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in frame, but the antibodies are for the receptor, so the Western shows the receptor, but eGFP isn't expressed because the ORF is out of frame.

Wait, but the question says the Western blot shows a signal proportional to actin. So the total proteins are present. So the antibodies detected the proteins, but if the eGFP isn't expressed, the Western would only have the receptor, not the eGFP.

But the question says the person used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the antibodies are for both the ligand and receptor, but in the mouse, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but eGFP isn't.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. If the promoter is CBA, which is strong, maybe that's not the issue.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So even after the stop is removed, eGFP isn't expressed because it's not in frame.

So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the ORF is out of frame.

In that case, the Western blot would show the receptor, but not eGFP. But the question doesn't specify which protein is detected, just that the signal is proportional to actin. So perhaps the eGFP is not expressed, and the Western only detects the receptor.

So the confocal wouldn't show the green because eGFP isn't expressed.

So the most likely reason is option D.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the control of an IRES element. The construct includes stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites, which are designed to be removed by Cre recombinase to allow co-expression of mCherry with the ligand and eGFP with the receptor. After crossing the mouse model with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, no green fluorescence was observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, the question focuses on the lack of eGFP expression in the same cells where Cre is active (neural crest cells). The issue is not about paracrine signaling but rather about the expression of eGFP in the construct. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were retained in the Golgi, it might not fluoresce due to improper folding or localization. However, the Western blot confirmed that the proteins are expressed, as the signal is proportional to actin loading. This suggests that the receptor and eGFP are being synthesized but not fluorescing, making this option less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under the IRES element, which is regulated by the upstream promoter. Since the Western blot confirmed protein expression, the lack of an enhancer is unlikely to be the issue. This option does not explain the absence of eGFP fluorescence.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The construct design places the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette flanked by lox2272 sites. Upon Cre-mediated recombination, the stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed. If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP will not be correctly translated, leading to its absence. This would result in no green fluorescence under confocal microscopy, consistent with the observed outcome. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The absence of green fluorescence is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP being out of frame, preventing proper translation of eGFP. This aligns with the observed lack of fluorescence in the confocal microscopy despite successful expression of the proteins, as confirmed by the Western blot.

**Answer: D**
