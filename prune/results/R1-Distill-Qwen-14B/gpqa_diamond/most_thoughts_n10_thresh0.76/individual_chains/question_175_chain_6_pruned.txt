Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and the radiation they produce. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, the question says the charge distribution is spheroidal, and the symmetry axis is along the z-axis. So I imagine a sort of ellipsoid shape, maybe like a football. Because it's oscillating, it should radiate electromagnetic waves. The wavelength of this radiation is λ.

In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ (measured from the z-axis). The maximum power is A. The question is asking two things: what's the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and what's the form of the function f.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a fraction and a λ dependence.

Wait, I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern has a specific form. The power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation pattern) for an oscillating dipole is given by something like (sinθ)^2 over θ squared or something like that? Or wait, maybe it's proportional to (sinθ)^2? Because a dipole's radiation is maximum perpendicular to the axis, so θ=90 degrees.

Wait, the power pattern for a dipole is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and it's zero along the axis (θ=0 and 180). The formula for the radiation intensity (which is power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum is when sinθ is 1, which is at θ=90. So at θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5, so (sinθ)^2 is 0.25. So the intensity at 30 would be 0.25 times the maximum. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, but wait. The total power is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles. So the maximum intensity is at 90 degrees. But the question says the maximum power is A. So if at θ=30, the intensity is (sinθ)^2 times the maximum intensity, which would be 0.25 times A. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because the function f is the intensity, and A is
