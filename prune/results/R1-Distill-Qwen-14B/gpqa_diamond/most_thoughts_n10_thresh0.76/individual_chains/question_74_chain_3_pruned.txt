Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about the probability of a single atom decaying after some time has passed without it decaying. 

Hmm, so the setup is that we have an atom, and we know from previous experiments that the probability of it decaying within 100 minutes is 32%. So, that means there's a 32% chance it will decay in that first 100 minutes. But wait, so far 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now, they're asking what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. 

Wait, so the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Does that affect the remaining probability? I remember something about radioactive decay being a memoryless process. Oh right, the exponential decay model says that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes shouldn't change the probabilities for the future. But I'm not entirely sure, so maybe I should think it through.

So, let's break it down. The decay probability in a given time is often modeled with an exponential function. The formula for the probability that a nucleus hasn't decayed by time t is P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

Wait, but in this problem, we're given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32. So we can write that as P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Therefore, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. So λ is such that ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that.

Calculating ln(0.68)... I think ln(0.7) is about -0.356, so ln(0.68) should be a bit lower, maybe around -0.385 or something. So λ ≈ 0.00385 per minute. 

But maybe I don't need to calculate the exact λ. Because the question is about the probability after another 150 minutes, given that 50 have passed already. So the total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, if the decay is memoryless, then the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50 is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period, regardless of prior time. 

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. But because it's memoryless, the decay process doesn't 'remember' the past. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
