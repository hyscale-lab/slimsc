Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and we're supposed to determine the final product after a series of reactions. The reagents used are first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. The options are four different aldehydes or related compounds.

First, I think I should analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting material. Let's look at the 1H NMR peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): This is a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, that's a triplet, which is a bit unusual since aldehydes usually split into doublets if next to another proton. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to an aldehyde, but that's less likely. Or perhaps it's a different group.

Wait, another thought: If it's a triplet, maybe it's next to a CH2 group. But aldehydes are RCHO, so the adjacent CH2 would have two protons. So the aldehyde proton would be a triplet if it's next to a CH2. Wait, but usually the coupling is with one proton, like in CH2ClCH2CHO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might be wrong, perhaps it's an amide or something else.

Next peak: 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a pair of aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, but in a para-substituted benzene, each proton is adjacent (meta) to two others. Wait, no, that's ortho. Wait, no, in a para-disubstituted benzene, each H is adjacent to two others (ortho), so their coupling would be more than one, but perhaps as a doublet of doublets? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the splitting.

Then, 6.51 ppm (d, 2H). Another doublet of two aromatic protons. Maybe another para-substituted ring, but perhaps a substituent that causes the shift. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ortho coupling within a benzene ring.

Then 6.
