Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about a spin 1/2 particle, which has a magnetic moment mu given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with this field. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment after this change.

Hmm. So the setup is a spin-1/2 system. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. Since the moment is aligned with B, the spin must be in the +Z eigenstate, right? Because if the magnetic moment is aligned, it's in the state with maximum magnetic moment, which for spin-1/2 is spin-up along Z.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off. Wait, when the magnetic field is off, what happens to the spin state? Well, without a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is zero. So the state doesn't change. But then, another magnetic field is applied along +Y. Now, the Hamiltonian will be different because the field is in a different direction.

Wait, but the new field is along +Y. So the Hamiltonian suddenly changes to H = -mu · B'. Because when the field is applied, the magnetic moment interacts with it. Wait, mu is gamma S_z, and the field is along Y. So H would be proportional to S_y. Let me think about the signs.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. The energy of a magnetic dipole in a field is U = -mu · B. So when the field is along +Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S_z, and B is along Y, which is the Y direction. So H becomes H = -gamma S_z * B * (Y component). Wait, no, more accurately, the dot product is mu · B, which would be (gamma S_x, gamma S_y, gamma S_z) · (0, B, 0) )? Wait, no, wait. The field is along Y, so B is (0, B, 0). And the magnetic moment vector is mu = gamma S, which is in the direction of the original field, which was along Z. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S_z. So mu is a vector whose components are (gamma S_x, gamma S_y, gamma S_z), or is it a vector in the direction of the spin? Hmm, maybe I should just think in terms of the components.

Wait, when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian H will be proportional to S_y. Because the magnetic moment mu is in the direction of the spin (since mu = gamma S_z, but wait, maybe that's not correct. Oh wait, mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. So mu is a vector where only the z-component is non-zero, but that's only when the spin is along Z.
