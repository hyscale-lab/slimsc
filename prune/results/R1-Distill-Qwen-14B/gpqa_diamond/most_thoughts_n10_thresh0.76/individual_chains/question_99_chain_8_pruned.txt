Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's take it step by step.

First, the question gives me the FTIR and 1H NMR data. I remember that FTIR is useful for identifying functional groups based on absorption peaks. The 1H NMR tells me about the structure, like the environment of the protons and the splitting patterns.

Looking at the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So I'm thinking the compound has a carboxylic acid group because they have O-H bonds which absorb strongly in that area. The broadness suggests it's a carboxylic acid since alcohols or amines have less broad or different peaks. Also, the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have that around 1700 cm⁻¹, so that fits.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum. The key points are:
- No peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So the compound doesn't have any double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, like in alkenes. That rules out any structures with double bonds, but looking at the options, I don't see any double bonds in the structures given. All seem to be saturated.
- One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a complicated splitting. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. These splitting patterns suggest that the protons are coupled with multiple sets of neighboring protons. Let's think about coupling. Each split is due to neighboring J-couplings. For example, a doublet (n=1) is two peaks, triplet (n=2), quartet (n=3), etc.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, that's like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the structure has two C(H)(C2H5) groups attached to a central carbon? Or maybe it's branching. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution. Wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So perhaps the structure is something like:

(CH3)(C2H5)C-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2CH3) groups attached.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw each structure mentally. Let's see each option:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the carbon chain is CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, that's a four-carbon chain
