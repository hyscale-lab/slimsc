Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry of the final product. Let me take it step by step.

The question says that toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to make product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form product 3. I need to find the molecular symmetry group of product 3.

Hmm, I remember that nitric acid and sulfuric acid are typically involved in nitration reactions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, which is a good activating group. So product 1 is probably nitrotoluene. Where does the nitro group attach? Since toluene is methylbenzene, the nitration would likely occur at the para position because the methyl group is an ortho/para director. Wait, but sometimes in nitration, especially under certain conditions, the para is more favored. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene, I think.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. For nitrotoluene, oxidation typically occurs. Para-nitrotoluene would oxidize. Wait, nitrotoluene is methylbenzene with a nitro group. When you oxidize that, the methyl group adjacent to the nitro group would form a ketone. Oh right, because the methyl group attached to a benzene ring with a nitro group is activated towards oxidation. So the methyl becomes a carbonyl group. So product 2 would be benzoic acid with a nitro group? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the oxidation of toluene derivatives. Toluene's methyl group is CH3, if nitro is attached, the oxidation would convert CH3 to COOH? Or wait, sometimes in the presence of a nitro group, the oxidation might lead to a ketone. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, nitrotoluene (para-nitro toluene) is C6H5-NO2 with a CH3 group attached. When oxidized, the methyl group (CH3) next to the nitro group (para) would be oxidized. The oxidation of a methyl group adjacent to a nit
