Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about the metric given and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on differential geometry, but let me think through this step by step.

So the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because there are dx and dy terms. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a two-dimensional surface in some higher-dimensional space, maybe like a sphere in Minkowski space?

Wait, no. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But in terms of geometry, how does that relate to the metric? I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should try to figure out what kind of geometry this metric represents.

The metric has the form ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²), which is similar to a conformally flat metric. So it's a conformal transformation of the Euclidean metric. The function f(x,y) here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the factor is 32/(4 - (x² + y²)).

Wait, the denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, and the metric blows up. That suggests that the space is only defined where 4 - (x² + y²) > 0. So x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Oh, because 4 is (2)^2.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure. So pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature. How does that relate to the metric here?

Alternatively, maybe this metric is describing a two-dimensional space that's a pseudosphere. Let me think about the area. So the area of a pseudosphere is tricky because it's an infinite surface, but wait, maybe not. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the metric. The line element is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So this looks like a metric conformal to the flat metric, with a conformal factor that depends on x and y. In such cases, the Gaussian curvature is related to the function f(x,y).

The formula for the Gaussian curvature K of a conformal metric f²(dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(2 f²)) * Δ ln f, where Δ is the Laplacian in two dimensions. But perhaps I don't need to compute K right now; maybe the question is more straightforward.

The area element in this metric would be dA = sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But since this is a diagonal metric with E = F = 0 (assuming the metric is written as ds² = E dx² + 2F dx dy + G dy²), so determinant sqrt(EG - F²) = sqrt(E G) since F is zero. So E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So determinant is [32/(4 - r²)]², where r² = x² + y².

Wait, but for the area element, it's sqrt(g) dx dy. So sqrt(g) would be sqrt(EG) = 32/(4 - r²), since E and G are the same here. So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

But wait, the area of the entire space? Because the region where x² + y² < 4 is a disk of radius 2. So to find the area, we can integrate dA over this disk.

So the area A is the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. To compute this, I can switch to polar coordinates because of the radial symmetry.

In polar coordinates, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The θ integral just gives 2π, so A = 2π * ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let’s set u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r → - (du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. The integral becomes:

∫ [32 * r dr] / (4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [r dr /u ] = 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ ( -du/2 ) / u ].

Which is 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (-du/u) → 16 ∫ (from 4 to 0) (-du/u) = 16 [ ln|u| ] from 4 to 0. Wait, but when u approaches 0, ln u approaches negative infinity. So this integral is 16 [ (ln 0) - (ln4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral diverges to infinity. So the area A becomes 2π multiplied by an infinite value.

Wait, but that would mean the area is infinite. Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

But wait, the question says 'the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2'. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the metric.

Wait a second, the metric given is in two dimensions, but a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface embedded in three-dimensional space, like the tractricoid. But perhaps the metric is representing the pseudosphere itself.

Wait, but the pseudosphere has finite area, right? Or is it infinite? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. From what I remember, the tractricoid (the surface of the pseudosphere) has finite area. But I might be getting that wrong.

Wait, let me think. The tractrix has a certain property where the surface area is finite. For a pseudosphere, I think the area is finite. So why is the integral giving me an infinite area?

Oh wait, perhaps because the metric given is not that of the pseudosphere but something else. Or maybe I'm integrating over a region that's actually an infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric describes a space that is not the entire pseudosphere, but a part of it, leading to an infinite area. Or maybe I'm integrating in the wrong coordinates.

Wait, let me double-check the metric. It's ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). The denominator becomes zero at x² + y² =4, so the space is defined for r < 2. So the region is a disk of radius 2. But the integral of the area element over this disk is leading to an infinite area, as the integrand approaches infinity as r approaches 2.

So according to this metric, the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So I'm getting something conflicting because I thought the pseudosphere has finite area. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the metric of the pseudosphere with another metric. Let me remember the metric of a pseudosphere. The tractricoid, which is a pseudosphere, has a metric that can be written in terms of the tractrix coordinates.

Wait, the tractrix has parametrization, but perhaps the metric is different from what's given here. Alternatively, the given metric could be a different representation.

Wait, another approach: the given metric could be conformally related to flat space, which would have Gaussian curvature proportional to 1/(4 - r²)² or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the Gaussian curvature K can be computed. For a conformal metric f²(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is given by K = - (1/(2 f²)) (Δ ln f), where Δ is the Laplacian in 2D.

So here, f = sqrt(32/(4 - r²))? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The metric is f² (dx² + dy²), where f² = 32/(4 - r²). Wait no, actually, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²). So f² = 32/(4 - r²), so f = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

But ln f = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²). So the Laplacian in 2D of ln f is the Laplacian of the second term, since the first term is constant.

The Laplacian of ln(4 - r²) in polar coordinates is (1/r) d/dr (r d/dr (ln(4 - r^2))) ) → let's compute.

d/dr ln(4 - r²) = (-2r)/(4 - r²).

Multiply by r: r * (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) = (-2 r²)/(4 - r²).

Then d/dr of that is [ (-2*(2r)(4 - r²) ) - (-2 r²)(-2r) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as:

First, ln(4 - r²) → let me write this as ln(4 - r²) = ln(4) + ln(1 - (r²/4)).

The Laplacian of this would be zero from the first term. The second term, ln(1 - (r²/4)), can be expanded as a Taylor series, but perhaps it's easier to compute the derivatives directly.

Alternatively, in polar coordinates, the Laplacian of a function g(r) is (1/r) d/dr [ r d g/dr ].

So let’s compute d/dr [ r d/dr (ln(4 - r²)) ].

We know d/dr (ln(4 - r²)) = (-2r)/(4 - r²).

Multiply by r: r * (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) = (-2 r²)/(4 - r²).

Now, take the derivative of this with respect to r:

d/dr [ (-2 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ]

Let me compute that using the quotient rule.

Numerator: -2 r² → dN/dr = -4 r.

Denominator: 4 - r² → dD/dr = -2 r.

So derivative is [ (-4 r)(4 - r²) - (-2 r²)(-2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(-4r)(4 - r²) = -16 r +4 r^3.

(-2 r^2)(-2 r) = 4 r^3. But wait, the denominator is squared, and we have [Numerator] = (-4r)(4 - r²) ) - [ (denominator) * (dN/dt factor?) ].

Wait, perhaps I should write it correctly.

The derivative is [ (dN/dr) * D - N * dD/dr ] / D^2.

Here, N = -2 r², D =4 - r².

So dN/dr = -4r, dD/dr = -2r.

So putting together:

[ (-4r)(4 - r²) - (-2 r²)(-2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Compute numerator:

(-4r)(4 - r²) = -16 r +4 r^3.

(-2 r²)(-2 r) = 4 r^3. But wait, the second term is subtracted because of the formula: [ (dN/dr) D - N (dD/dr) ].

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the signs wrong in the formula.

Wait, the formula is [ (dN/dr) * D - N * (dD/dr) ] / D².

So:

First term: dN/dr * D → (-4r)(4 - r²) = -16 r +4 r^3.

Second term: N * dD/dr → (-2 r²)(-2 r) = 4 r^3.

So the numerator becomes [ (-16 r +4 r^3 ) ] - [4 r^3 ] → (-16 r +4 r^3 -4 r^3 ) = -16 r.

So the entire expression is (-16 r) / (4 -r²)^2.

So putting it all together, the Laplacian of ln(4 -r²) is (1/r) * [ (-16 r)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ] * (1/2?), wait, no. Wait, the Laplacian is (1/r) d/dr [ ... ].

Wait, wait. Let me retrace.

The Laplacian of g(r) is (1/r) d/dr [ r (dg/dr) ].

We had dg/dr = (-2 r)/(4 - r²).

So r dg/dr = (-2 r²)/(4 - r²).

Then d/dr (r dg/dr) ) = [ (-2 r²)/(4 - r^2) ]' 

Which we computed as (-16 r)/(4 - r^2)^2.

So the Laplacian is (1/r) * [ (-16 r)/(4 - r^2)^2 ] → (1/r) * (-16 r)/(4 -r²)^2 ) = (-16)/(4 - r²)^2.

So the Laplacian of ln(4 - r²) is (-16)/(4 -r²)^2.

So now, putting back into the Gaussian curvature formula:

K = -(1/(2 f²)) * (Laplacian of ln f )

But wait, f² is 32/(4 -r²), so f = sqrt(32/(4 -r²)), so ln f = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 -r²).

So the Laplacian of ln f is Laplacian of [ - (1/2) ln(4 - r²) ] → which is -1/2 * [ (-16)/(4 - r²)^2 ] = 8/(4 -r²)^2.

Wait, let me compute that again. Laplacian of ln f is Laplacian of [ - (1/2) ln(4 - r²) ].

Which is ( -1/2 ) * Laplacian of ln(4 -r²) → which is ( -1/2 ) * [ (-16)/(4 -r²)^2 ) ] = (8)/(4 -r²)^2.

So now, the Gaussian curvature K is:

K = -(1/(2 f²)) * (8)/(4 -r²)^2 )

But f² is 32/(4 -r²). So 1/(2 f²) = (4 -r²)/(64).

So,

K = -( (4 - r²)/(64) ) * (8)/(4 -r²)^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

(4 - r²) cancels with (4 - r²)^2, leaving 1/(4 - r²).

So,

K = -( (8) * (4 - r²) ) / (64 (4 -r²)^2 ) ) → Wait, wait, let me compute step by step.

Wait, the term is (4 - r²) in numerator and denominator.

Wait, in the expression:

K = -( [ (4 - r²) ) / 64 ] ) * [ 8 / (4 -r²)^2 ) ]

So (4 - r²) in numerator and (4 -r²)^2 in denominator → (4 -r²)^(-1).

So,

K = - (8 * (4 - r²) ) / (64 (4 -r²)^2 ) )

Wait, wait no: (4 -r²) in numerator and (4 -r²)^2 in denominator → (4 -r²)^{-1}.

So,

K = - (8) / (64 (4 - r²)) )

Simplify 8/64 → 1/8.

So K = - 1/(8 (4 - r²)).

That's the Gaussian curvature. Hmm.

Wait, but for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative and constant, right? Because a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature.

But here, the Gaussian curvature is varying with r, not constant. So perhaps this is not a pseudosphere, but some other surface with varying curvature.

So this suggests that the metric given is not that of a pseudosphere, but another surface. So perhaps the question is a bit of a trick, and the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps I'm conflating different concepts here. Maybe the given metric isn't the pseudosphere's metric. So perhaps the question is just asking about the area computed via the given metric, regardless of whether it's a pseudosphere.

In that case, as I computed earlier, the area integral gives an infinite result.

So the options are:

A) 0 → No, the area is not zero.

B) 4π(x² + y²) → That's a function, but the area should be a number, not dependent on coordinates.

C) 4π(x² - y²) → Same issue.

D) +infty → That fits with the integral diverging.

So the correct answer is D.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space conformally related to the Euclidean metric. The domain of this metric is restricted to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. The area element in this metric is given by:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\). To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the disk \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) simplifies the expression to:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 16 \int_4^0 \frac{-du}{u}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
A = 32\pi \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}\) diverges as \(u \to 0\), leading to an infinite result for the area \(A\). Therefore, the total area of the space described by the metric is infinite.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as the area is a scalar and does not depend on coordinates.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, for the same reason as above.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
