Okay, so I've got this physics question here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, from what I remember, bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if certain conditions are met. The interaction Lagrangian is given, and the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV.

The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, so the interaction term must be something like X ψ ψ, since when you expand it, the X would couple to two fermions. So the boson X is interacting with the fermions, making it possible for X to decay into fermion pairs.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. For decay to happen, the energy must be enough to create the fermion pair. That means the mass of the fermion times 2 (since you create a pair) must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So the maximum fermion mass that X can decay into is 3 GeV each.

Wait, but which fermions have masses below 3 GeV? Let's think about the known fermion masses. For leptons: electrons are almost massless, around 0.0005 GeV. Muons are about 0.1 GeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV. So tau is okay because 2 * 1.78 is ~3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait. If X is 6 GeV, then the maximum mass for each fermion is 3 GeV. Because 2m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Oh wait, no, because when a particle at rest decays, the total energy is its rest mass. So the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the parent. So 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list the fermion masses:

Quarks: Up and down are light, around ~0.005 GeV each. Strange is about 100 MeV (0.1 GeV), but wait, I think I might
