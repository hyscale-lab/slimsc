Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of six different benzene derivatives with excess bromine. Each of these substances will form a monobromo derivative, and we're supposed to arrange them based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced, from the least to the most.

First, I need to understand what factors influence where the bromine adds on the benzene ring. I remember that substituents on the benzene ring can be activating or deactivating, and they can also be ortho/para directors or meta directors. The nature of the substituent will determine the product distribution.

The substituents in each of the six compounds are:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, wait, the second one is COOEt, which is an ester group. And the sixth is COOH, a carboxylic acid. Also, substituent 3 is Cl, which is a halogen, and substituent 4 is nitro, a strong deactivating group.

So, let's list out the substituents and their activating/deactivating nature and their directing effects.

1) Methyl (CH3): Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. It is an ortho/para director. So the bromine will add more at the para position than the meta, but since it's ortho/para, the major product would be a mix of ortho and para, but para will be more than meta.

Wait, but wait: in the case of a single substituent, the major product is typically para, but when substitution is possible in both ortho and para, which one is more favored? For activating groups like methyl, the ring is activated, so the bromine tends to add where the substituent can most stabilize the transition state. Since methyl is an activating group, the para and ortho positions are favored. But for a mono-substituted benzene, the para product is more favored than ortho because of steric hindrance and the stability of the transition state. So methyl would lead to more para substitution.

2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl): This is an ester group. Esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. They are meta directors. So the bromine would add in the meta position relative to the ester group. Wait, but wait: the ester group is an electron-withdrawing group, so it deactivates the ring, making it less reactive. So the ring is less reactive overall, but when substitution occurs, it's directed to the meta position.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent here is COOEt. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) because of the carbonyl. So the ring is deactivating, so it's harder to substitute. But directionally, since it's an EWG, it's a meta director. So the bromine will add in the meta position.

3) Cl (chlorine): Chlorine is an interesting substituent. It's a halogen, which is slightly deactivating because of the electronegativity of Cl pulling electrons away through inductive effect. However, the lone pairs on Cl can donate electrons through resonance, making it an ortho/para director. But because it's deactivating, the ring is less reactive than benzene. So, substitution occurs in ortho and para, but because of the deactivation, maybe the para is more favored? Or is it a mix? I think for Cl, the substituent directs to ortho and para but is deactivating, so the substitution is slower than benzene but still occurs at ortho and para. But when there are substituents, like in mono-substituted benzene, the para product is major for Cl, similar to methyl but with lower reactivity.

Wait, no. Wait, for nitro groups, which are strong deactivating and meta directing, substitution happens at meta. For Cl, which is a weaker deactivating (since it can donate electrons via resonance), it's ortho/para. So, in the case of Cl, the bromine adds in ortho and para, but since it's a deactivating group, the para might be more favored because of steric factors or perhaps because of better transition state stabilization. But I'm not entirely sure about the dominance between ortho and para here. I'll have to think about that.

4) NO2 (nitro): Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So substitution occurs primarily at the meta position relative to the nitro group. Since the nitro group is a strong deactivator, the ring is less reactive, so the bromine will add only in the meta position, but the activation is low. So the para isomer wouldn't form; the main product is meta.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. The nitro group is a meta director. So the bromine adds meta to the nitro. But in the case of a mono-substituted benzene with a nitro group, the substitution can only be in the meta position, right? Because there's only one substituent. So the major product would be the meta-substituted bromobenzene. So in this case, the para-isomer wouldn't form. So the weight fraction of the para-isomer is zero? Or maybe negligible? So in this case, the para isomer is not formed, so the weight fraction is the lowest.

Wait, but wait. Electrophilic substitution on a benzene ring with a nitro group as the substituent. Since the nitro group is a meta director, the bromine adds in the meta position. So for compound 4, there is no para product. So the yield of the para isomer is zero, meaning it's the least. So in the arrangement, compound 4 would be first.

5) C2H5 (ethyl): Similar to methyl, ethyl is an activating group, since it's an alkyl group, donating electrons through the inductive effect. It's an ortho/para director, so the bromine tends to add in the ortho and para positions. But again, steric factors might make para more favorable than ortho. So the major product is the para isomer.

6) COOH (carboxylic acid): The COOH group is a strong deactivating group. It's a meta director, similar to nitro or ester groups. Because of the -COOH group, the ring is deactivating, so the bromine adds in the meta position. Wait, but wait: for the COOH group, which is -COOH, it's an electron-withdrawing group, so the ring is deactivating, and the directing is meta. So substitution is meta to the COOH group.

Wait, but wait: nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta-directing, while ester groups (like COOEt in compound 2) are also meta-directing and deactivating. So for COOH, it's a similar situation. So for compounds 2,4,6, the substituents are deactivating and meta-directing. So their substitution occurs in the meta position. So for these, the para-isomer is not formed (or very little), so their para yield is low.

Now, the problem is to arrange the compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So which compounds have the least para isomer, and which have the most.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each compound, we're looking at the percentage of the product that is the para-substituted bromide.

So for each substituent:

1) Methyl (activating, ortho/para): So the para product is more than meta, but in the case of a single substituent, the major product is para (since ortho would have steric hindrance from the substituent). So for compound 1, the para product is major.

2) COOEt (deactivating, meta-directing): So substitution is meta, so para product is minor or zero. So for compound 2, the para isomer is not formed.

3) Cl (deactivating, ortho/para): Wait, Cl is a deactivating substituent (because of the inductive effect) but is an ortho/para director due to resonance. So substitution occurs at ortho and para. Which one is more favorable? For Cl, the para position is more favored than ortho because ortho substitution leads to more steric hindrance. So the para product would be major. So in this case, the para isomer is the major product, higher yield.

Wait, but wait. Because Cl is a deactivating group, the ring is less reactive, but the substituent allows for substitution in ortho and para. So for substitution, the para product is major. So for compound 3, the para product is high.

4) NO2 (deactivating, meta-directing): So substitution is meta, so no para product. So para isomer is zero. So for compound 4, the para yield is zero.

5) C2H5 (activating, ortho/para): So substitution occurs in ortho and para. Para is major due to less steric hindrance, so para product is high.

6) COOH (deactivating, meta-directing): Substitution is meta, so para product is zero.

So now, let's list each compound and the para yield:

1) CH3: high para yield.

2) COOEt: low (meta), so para is 0.

3) Cl: high para yield.

4) NO2: 0 para.

5) C2H5: high para.

6) COOH: 0 para.

Wait, but I might be making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the para-isomer is formed only when the substituent is ortho/para directing, right? Because if the substituent is meta directing, then the substitution occurs meta, so para is not formed. So for substituents that are meta directors, the para product is not formed.

So, for compounds 2,4,6, the substituent is meta director. So their para products are not formed. So their para yield is zero.

Wait, but wait. For compound 2, the substituent is COOEt (ester), which is meta directing. So bromine adds in meta, so the para product is not formed. So para fraction is zero.

Similarly, for 4 and 6 (nitro and COOH), para fractions are zero.

For the ortho/para directors (activating), which are 1 (methyl), 3 (Cl), 5 (ethyl), the para product is formed. But wait, wait: Cl is deactivating but is an ortho/para director. So the para product is formed.

But wait, for a substituent that's deactivating but ortho/para (like Cl), the para product is major. So for compound 3, Cl, the para product is high.

Wait, but when the substituent is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, so the electrophilic substitution is slower. So for the para product, the yield is lower than if the substituent were activating, but relative to other substituents, the para product is higher than meta ones.

So let's think about each substituent and the expected major product.

1) Methyl: activating, o/p director. Para is major.

3) Cl: deactivating, o/p director. Para is major (but less reactive than with activating groups).

5) Ethyl: activating, o/p director. Para is major.

So the para fractions for 1,3,5 are higher than 2,4,6.

Now, the question is, which of these (1,3,5) has higher or lower para fractions.

In the case of activating groups, the ring is more reactive, so the para product is major. But when the substituent is deactivating (like Cl), the ring is less reactive, but the para product is still major relative to meta.

So the para yield order among 1,3,5 would depend on the substituent's effect.

Wait, but wait: the substituent's activating strength affects the para yield. For example, a stronger activating group (like -NH2) would make the ring more reactive, so substitution is more likely. But in our case,
