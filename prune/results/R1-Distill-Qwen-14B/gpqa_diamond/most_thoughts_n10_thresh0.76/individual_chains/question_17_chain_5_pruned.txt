Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me think through this step by step. Hmm, the question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, what's a stoichiometric complex? Oh right, that means the ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1. So each formula unit of Ca-EDTA has one Ca²+ ion.

The problem also gives me the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant, also known as the stability constant, tells us how stable a complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so it doesn't dissociate much.

So, the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Right, because even though the EDTA is in a complex, some of it might dissociate, releasing Ca²+ ions. But wait, given that the K is so large, I think the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really low.

Let me try to write the equation for the dissociation. The complex is CaY²- (where Y is EDTA^4-), so it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-:
CaY²- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4-
The formation constant Kf is given by [Ca²+][Y^4-]/[CaY²-] = 5e10.

Wait, but in this case, the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-. Let's assume that the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02 M. That would make the denominator approximately 0.02, so the numerator [Ca²+][Y^4-] should be Kf * 0.02.

Wait, but because the stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentration of Y^4- is the same as [Ca²+]. Because for every mole of Ca that dissociates, a mole of Y is released. So [Ca²+] = [Y^4-] = x. Let me let x be the concentration of each.

So putting that into the equation:
x * x / 0.02 = 5e10
Which is x² = (5e10) * 0.02 = 1e9
So x² = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait a second. No, wait, 5e10 multiplied by 0.02 is 1e9. So x squared is 1e9, so x is sqrt(1e9) which is 3
