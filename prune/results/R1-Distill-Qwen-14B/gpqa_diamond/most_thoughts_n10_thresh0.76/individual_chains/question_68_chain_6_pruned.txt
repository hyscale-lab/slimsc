Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and how its magnetic moment oscillates when the magnetic field changes. Hmm, I remember from my quantum mechanics class that spin systems can exhibit oscillations when the Hamiltonian changes, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's break it down step by step.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu = gamma * Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. We're supposed to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The magnetic moment mu is aligned with B, so the particle's spin is along Z. But when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian must change, which would cause the state to evolve differently.

I think the magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, S can be in any direction, but in the presence of a magnetic field, the system's energy levels depend on the component of S along the field direction.

The initial state must be an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian. The initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu · B. Since B is along Z, H_initial is proportional to Sz. So the eigenstates are |+> and |-> along Z, with energies proportional to +1/2 and -1/2 times some factor.

Then, the field is turned off and another one is applied along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu · B', where the field is along Y. Since mu is gamma * S, H_final is proportional to S_y. So H_final is proportional to Sy.

Wait, but when the field is turned off, there's a sudden change in the Hamiltonian. So the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously; it's still the same state, but now the time evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve under H_final.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, which is <mu_z>. Since mu_z = gamma <Sz>, we can find the time dependence of <Sz> and thus see how it oscillates.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of Sz initially. Let me think: Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz, say |+z> or |−z>, because the initial Hamiltonian depends on Sz. Then, when the field changes direction, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which is Sy. So the state will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is an energy eigenstate of H_initial, but not of H_final, so the time evolution leads to varying expectation values.

Let me model this. Let's say the initial state is |+z> because the magnetic moment is aligned with the field. Then, when the field is along Y, the system's state evolves as per H_final.

The time evolution is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state at time t after the change is |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H_final t / ħ) |ψ(0)>.

But to find <Sz>, we need to compute <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>.

Wait, let's write down H_final. Since mu = gamma S, and the new B is along Y, H_final = -mu · B * direction. Wait, no, the exact form is H = - mu · B. But mu is gamma S, and B is a vector. So H_final = - gamma B (S · Y_hat). So S · Y_hat is (Sx * 0 + Sy * 1 + Sz * 0) = Sy. So H_final is proportional to Sy.

H_final = - gamma B Sy.

Wait, but the sign might not matter for the frequency. Or perhaps I should think about the energy eigenvalues. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |−y>, with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively, but considering units, perhaps we can set ħ=1 for simplicity.

Wait, but in our case, the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. So when the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy, the state |+z> can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of Sy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this using time evolution. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H_final t / ħ).

H_final is proportional to Sy, so that would be H_final = (gamma B) Sy. Wait, maybe I should write it as H = ω Sy, where ω is some frequency. Let's see, since H_final = - gamma B Sy, but the sign might affect the time dependence.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the time evolution of <Sz>.

Since the initial state is |+z>, which is |↑⟩_z. Let's express this state in terms of the eigenstates of H_final, which are the eigenstates of Sy.

The eigenstates of Sy are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. |+z⟩ can be written as a superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

Wait, the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |−y>, which can be written in terms of |+z> and |−z> as follows:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2

Wait no, wait, let me correct that. Because the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |−y>, and they are superpositions of |+z> and |−z>.

Actually, I think the correct expressions are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2

Wait, let me double-check. The spin matrices in different directions. For spin-1/2, Sy is proportional to the Pauli Y matrix, which is (0 -i; i 0)/2. So the eigenvectors would be [1, 1]/√2 and [1, -1]/√2, which correspond to the eigenstates |+y> and |−y>, respectively.

So yes, |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2, and |−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2.

So, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/√2. Because substituting the above into |+z>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/√2.

So when the Hamiltonian is H_final = (gamma B) Sy, the time evolution for each eigenstate is multiplied by a phase factor.

Wait, no, the Hamiltonian is H_final = - gamma B Sy. Or is it? Let me think again. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is H = - mu · B. Since B is along Y, H_final = - gamma B Sy.

So H_final = - gamma B Sy.

The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So the energies are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, but since ħ is Planck's constant, I think in our case, maybe we're using units where ħ=1 or maybe it's considered as part of the parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is H = gamma B Sy. Wait, that's a point I'm getting confused about.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy in a magnetic field B is U = - mu · B. So H = - mu · B.

So if B is along Y, H = - gamma B Sy.

So the energy eigenstates are |+y> and |−y>, with energies E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, but in terms of the time evolution operator, it's U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ).

So for each eigenstate |+y>, the time evolution is exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) = exp( i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )

Similarly, for |−y>, it's exp(-i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B ( - ħ/2 ) t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )

Wait, wait. Let me compute E_+ and E_-.

E_+ = - gamma B ( Sy |+y> ) = - gamma B ( ħ/2 )

Similarly, E_- = - gamma B ( - ħ/2 ) = gamma B ( ħ/2 )

So the energies are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2, E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2.

Then, the time evolution factors for each state are:

exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ ) ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )

Similarly for E_-:

exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ ) ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

Wait, but wait, E_+ is - gamma B ħ / 2, so:

exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )

Similarly, E_- is gamma B ħ /2, so:

exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

So the state |+y> evolves as |+y> * exp( i gamma B t / 2 )

The state |−y> evolves as |−y> * exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

So, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2)

So after time t, the state is:

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) + |−y> exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) ] / sqrt(2)

Now, we need to compute <Sz>. Since Sz |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and similarly for |−z>, we can express Sz in terms of |+z> and |−z>.

Wait, alternatively, since |+y> and |−y> are expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z>, let's write |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |−z>.

Wait, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2)

So, |psi(t)> = [ |+y> exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) + |−y> exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) ] / sqrt(2)

But |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2), and |−y> = (|+z
