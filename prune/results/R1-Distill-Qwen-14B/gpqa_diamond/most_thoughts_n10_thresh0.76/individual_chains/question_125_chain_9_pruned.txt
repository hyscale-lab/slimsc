Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy level. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which I remember is the harmonic oscillator potential. Since it's isotropic in three dimensions, the problem is spherically symmetric.

I remember that in 3D, the energy levels for a harmonic oscillator can be described using the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z, but for spherical symmetry, it's more convenient to use the principal quantum number n, which is related to the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed in terms of the radial quantum number and the angular momentum quantum number l.

Wait, no, in 3D, the energy levels are actually determined by the sum of the quantum numbers. Oh right! The energy levels are given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers in x, y, z directions (n = n_x + n_y + n_z). Alternatively, since the potential is isotropic, another approach is to think in terms of the radial quantum number n_r and the angular momentum quantum number l. But I need to be careful here.

Wait, the energy levels for the 3D harmonic oscillator are also sometimes expressed using the principal quantum number N, which is a positive integer. The energy is E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N = 2n_r + l. Here, n_r is the radial quantum number, and l is the angular momentum quantum number (0,1,2,...).

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to get this straight. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So each
