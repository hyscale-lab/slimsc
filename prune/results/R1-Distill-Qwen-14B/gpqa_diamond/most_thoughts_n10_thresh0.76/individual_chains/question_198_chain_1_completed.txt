Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that stability constants (β) are used to describe the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let's think about what these complexes are.

Co(II) can form complexes with thiocyanate (SCN-) in different stoichiometries. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) where n is the number of thiocyanate ions attached. The stability constants βn represent the formation from the previous complex. So β1 would be for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^0, β3 for Co(SCN)_3^-2, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4^2-.

Wait, wait, or is it that βn is the formation constant for the nth complex from the (n-1)th? So the overall formation for each step is given by βn. So the overall formation constant for the fourth complex would be the product of β1, β2, β3, and β4. Or maybe each β is the cumulative constant up to that complex. Oh wait, no, I think each βn is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth SCN-.

Wait, stability constants can be either cumulative or stepwise. Cumulative β would be the constant for forming the complex all the way from the metal ion, like Co^2+ + 4 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, and the β would be β_total = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4. But if the β's given are stepwise, meaning each step's constant, then the overall for each complex is the product up to that step.

So for example, the first complex is CoSCN^+ with β1=9. The second would be Co(SCN)_2^0, and its formation is CoSCN^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^0, so the stepwise β2=40. So the overall β for Co(SCN)_2^0 is β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

Wait, no, wait. If β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, then β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]). For the second complex, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-]). So the overall β for the second complex would be β1 * β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2). So each βn is stepwise, so the nth complex is formed by adding an SCN to the (n-1)th complex.

Right, so for Co(SCN)_n^(2−n), the formation constants are stepwise. So the problem gives each step's β. So the overall stability for each complex is the product of previous β's up to that n.

So the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, has β1=9. The second, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, has β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360. The third, [Co(SCN)_3]^-2, has β1 * β2 * β3 =9 *40*63= 22680. The fourth, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, has β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16. Let me calculate that. 9*40 is 360, 360*63 is 22680, 22680 *16 is 362,880.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So we need to find the fraction of Co that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and sum them up, then find what percentage is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex.

Wait, but wait. How many possible complexes are there?

The complexes are:

n=0: Co^2+ (no SCN attached)
n=1: [CoSCN]^+
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-2
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2−

But wait, the question is about the "blue dithiocyanato" complex. I think in the case of cobalt complexes, the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is blue as well, perhaps? Or maybe different colors. Wait, but the question specifies the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.

So, what's the general approach here? I think I'll need to consider all possible complexes and find their relative concentrations.

The problem is that the formation of each complex is dependent on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. So we can model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN-.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the formula:

fraction_n = (β1β2...βn) * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β1β2[SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN^-]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, wait. That's the formula for the fraction of the nth complex in a system where each complex is built stepwise. Let me think.

Alternatively, each species' concentration can be represented by:

[CoL_n] = K_n [Co^2+][L]^n,

where K_n is the product of β1 through βn.

But the total concentration of Co is the sum of all [CoL_n], including the free Co^2+.

Wait, another approach is to compute the fraction for each complex and the free ion. Let me outline the steps.

1. Compute the stability constants for each complex up to n=4.

   K1 = β1 =9
   K2= β1 * β2=9*40=360
   K3= β1 β2 β3=9*40*63=22680
   K4= β1 β2 β3 β4=9*40*63*16=362,880

2. The concentration terms for each species are:

   [Co^2+] = c0 (free ion)
   [CoSCN^+] = K1 * c0 * [SCN^-]
   [Co(SCN)_2^0] = K2 * c0 [SCN^-]^2
   [Co(SCN)_3^-2] = K3 * c0 [SCN^-]^3
   [Co(SCN)_4^2−] = K4 * c0 [SCN^-]^4

3. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species plus the free Co^2+.

   c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-2] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-]

   So,

   c_total = c0 + K1 c0 [SCN^-] + K2 c0 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 c0 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 c0 [SCN^-]^4

   Let me factor out c0:

   c_total = c0 [ 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 ]

   Since c_total is given as 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, I can compute each term.

4. So first, compute each term inside the brackets.

Let me compute each term:

[SCN] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term0 = 1

Term1 = K1 * [SCN] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2 = K2 * [SCN]^2 =360 * (0.1)^2 =360 * 0.01=3.6

Term3 = K3 * [SCN]^3 =22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68

Term4 = K4 * [SCN]^4 =362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288

Now, sum all these terms:

Sum = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288

Let me add them step by step:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So the denominator is 64.468.

Then, c_total = c0 * 64.468

We have c_total =1e-2 M. So,

c0 = (1e-2) /64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

But wait, c0 is the concentration of free Co^2+.

But the question is asking for the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is Term2.

So the fraction is (Term2) / Sum.

Term2 is 3.6, sum is 64.468.

So fraction = 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05554.

So that's approximately 5.554%.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made an error in calculating the terms. Let me recheck.

Wait, let's recalculate each term.

K1=9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

[SCN]=0.1 M.

Term0=1.

Term1 = K1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2= K2 * [SCN]^2=360 * 0.01=3.6.

Term3= K3 * [SCN]^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68.

Term4= K4 * [SCN]^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Sum: 1 + 0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Wait, that's correct. So the fraction for Co(SCN)_2^0 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05554, which is about 5.55%. But that's not among the options. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stability constants. Let me check: the β's are for the formation of each complex stepwise, but when you compute K2, is it β1 * β2, or is K2 = (β1 * [SCN]) + β2 etc.?

Wait, perhaps the way I'm calculating the fractions is incorrect. Let me think again about the approach.

Another approach is to model the distribution by considering that the total concentration (c_total) is the sum of all species (including the free Co^2+). Each species' concentration is given by the product of the formation constants up to that point multiplied by [SCN]^n.

So the formula for each species is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn) * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

But the total cobalt concentration is sum_{n=0}^4 [Co(SCN)_n] = c_total.

So,

c_total = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β1β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

We can factor out [Co^2+]:

c_total = [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [S] + β1β2 [S]^2 + β1β2β3 [S]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [S]^4 )

So,

[Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + β1[S] + β1β2 [S]^2 + β1β2β3 [S]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [S]^4 )

Once [Co^2+] is known, the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [S]^n, where K_n is the product of β's up to n.

So the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] would be:

([Co(SCN)_2]) / c_total = [K2 [Co^2+][S]^2] / c_total

But c_total is [Co^2+] multiplied by the sum.

So,

([Co(SCN)_2]) / c_total = (K2 [S]^2) / (1 + β1[S] + K2 [S]^2 + K3 [S]^3 + K4 [S]^4 )

So, let's compute this.

Compute each term:

β1=9, [S]=0.1.

Compute:

Term0=1,

Term1=β1 [S]=9*0.1=0.9,

Term2=β1β2 [S]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6,

Term3=β1β2β3 [S]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) *0.001=22.68,

Term4=β1β2β3β4 [S]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880) * 0.0001=36.288.

Sum=1+0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288=64.468.

So, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is Term2 / Sum = 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05554, which is ~5.55%. But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I misunderstood the question.

Wait, maybe the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which could be a different one. Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is not [Co(SCN)_2] but something else. Or maybe I'm missing some other complexes.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the complexes are including different charges, but perhaps the given β's are for different n? Like, perhaps the complexes go up to n=3 or another number. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So four β's, meaning four steps, so complexes up to n=4.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the order of the β's. Because β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. That seems odd because usually each step's β increases, but not always. So perhaps the order is such that β4 is lower than β3, which is possible because maybe the complexes become less stable beyond a certain point.

Wait, but that doesn't change the approach. So perhaps the problem is that the dithiocyanato complex in the question refers to a different n. Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN ligands, so n=2. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So, the fraction would be 3.6/(sum 64.468)= ~5.55%, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the stability constants are cumulative. Wait, no, the question says the stability constants are β1=9, etc., which are the stepwise constants.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is that the solution is considering only the [Co(SCN)_2]^- complex, not the neutral one. But I thought [Co(SCN)_2] is neutral. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)_2]^2−, which would be a different species. But in that case, the β's would be arranged differently.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible complexes and their colors. Co(SCN)_2^0 is blue, Co(SCN)_3^- is blue, and Co(SCN)_4^2− is red. So perhaps the blue complexes are n=2 and n=3.

Wait, but the question specifically says 'dithiocyanato', which is two SCN ligands. So n=2.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Let me recompute the sum.

Sum: 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps there's another factor I'm missing. Oh, wait! The [Co^2+] is 1e-2 M, but the sum is [Co^2+] multiplied by the sum of terms. So the actual [Co^2+] is (1e-2) / sum.

Wait, but that's correct. So [Co^2+] is 1e-2 / 64.468 ≈1.551e-4 M.

Hmm. So the concentration of the [Co(SCN)_2] complex is K2 * [Co^2+] [S]^2.

K2 is β1 β2=9*40=360.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = 360 * 1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2.

Wait, let me compute that: 360 * 1.551e-4 = 0.055836. Then multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01.

So 0.055836 *0.01=0.00055836 M.

Then, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So the fraction is 0.00055836 / 0.01 = 0.055836, which is about 5.58%, which is still not matching any of the options.

So perhaps the approach is wrong. Another possibility is that the stability constants are given as logβ, but the problem just states β=9 etc. So that's unlikely.

Wait, wait! Another approach: perhaps the complexes are ordered differently. Let me think about the possible complexes and their β's.

Wait, perhaps the β's are given in a different order. For example, β1 is the first complex, β2 the second, etc. That would make sense. So β1=9 is [CoSCN]^+, β2=40 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3=63 is [Co(SCN)_3]^-2, and β4=16 is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Wait, but then for each complex, the formation constant is up to that step. So the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 has β1*β2=9*40=360. That's correct.

But maybe the problem is that the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^- or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the blue color is for a different complex, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

But the question specifies dithiocyanato, which is two SCN groups, so n=2.

Hmm. Maybe the problem uses the overall formation constant, not the stepwise. So wait, perhaps the given β's are the overall formation constants, not stepwise. Let me think.

If β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, then β1=9.

β2 is the overall for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which would be [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)=9*40=360.

Wait, but that's the same as stepwise, so it doesn't change anything.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the concentrations are expressed differently. The [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but perhaps it's in excess, so we can approximate that [SCN^-] remains approximately 0.1 M. But that's already considered in our calculation.

Wait, let me think about the possible error. Maybe I'm supposed to consider only up to n=3, but the question says β4=16 is given. Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is for a different complex, such as [Co(SCN)_3]^−, but that would change the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the formation constants are for the same charge state. Or perhaps the problem is that I'm missing another complex.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K4. Let me re-calculate K4.

K4=β1*β2*β3*β4=9 *40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880. Correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that the SCN^- is in such excess that the concentration can be considered constant. But even then, the approach I took would still hold.

Wait, but the calculation leads to about 5.5%, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^- instead of the neutral one. Let me see.

Wait, what's the formula for [Co(SCN)_2]^-? That would be n=2, but with an overall charge of -1, which would mean Co is +3? No, because Co is +2. So [Co(SCN)_2]^- would imply Co is +1, which can't be right. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Alternative idea: perhaps the question is about the sum of all blue complexes, which might include [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and [Co(SCN)_3]^-2. So let's compute those two fractions and add them.

So the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is 3.6 /64.468≈5.55%.

The fraction for [Co(SCN)_3]^-2 is Term3 / sum =22.68 /64.468≈0.3518, or 35.18%.

Adding 5.55% and 35.18% gives about 40.73%, which is approximately 40.7%, but the options are 42.3% (option A). That's close but not exact. Let me compute more precisely.

Calculating 3.6/64.468: 3.6 /64.468 = 0.05555 or 5.555%.

22.68 /64.468 = 0.3518, which is 35.18%.

Sum is 5.555 +35.18=40.735%, around 40.7%. But the option A is 42.3%, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the correct approach is to sum the two.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^- complex, but I don't think that's possible with Co^2+.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the K values.

Wait, perhaps the β4 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^− instead of [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Let me think. If [Co(SCN)_4]^- has β4=16, that would change the K4.

But that would change the K4 from 362880 to 9*40*63 *16= same as before. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are given as logβ, and I'm supposed to compute β as 10^β. Wait, if β1 is given as log β1=9, then β1=1e9. But that would make the fractions way larger, which doesn't fit the problem. So that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] in the solution considering the possibility of multiple complexes but not including the free Co^2+.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about what the options are.

The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Earlier, when I added the [Co(SCN)_2] and [Co(SCN)_3] fractions, I got about 40.7%. So the closest option is A)42.3%, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate all the terms with more precise numbers.

Let me recompute each term:

Term0: 1.

Term1: β1 * [S] =9 * 0.1 =0.9.

Term2: β1*β2 * [S]^2=9 *40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: β1*β2*β3 * [S]^3=9*40*63=22680; 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [S]^4=9*40*63*16=362880; 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions with more precision.

Fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is 3.6/64.468 = let's compute this.

3.6 /64.468 = ?

Let me compute 64.468 * 0.055 = 64 *0.055=3.52, 0.468*0.055≈0.02574 → total≈3.54574. 3.6 is a bit more. So 0.055 + (3.6-3.54574)/64.468 → 0.055 + (0.05426/64.468) ≈0.055 + 0.00084 ≈0.05584, so 5.584%.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3] is 22.68 /64.468.

22.68 /64.468 → let me compute 64.468 * 0.35 =22.5638. 22.68 is 0.1162 more than 22.5638. So 0.35 + (0.1162/64.468) → 0.35 + ~0.0018 → 0.3518, which is 35.18%.

Adding 5.584% and 35.18% gives 40.764%, which is approximately 40.76%. That's close to option A (42.3%) but not exact. So perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the β4 given is for [Co(SCN)_4]^−, not [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Let me see. If β4=16 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^−, then the K4 would be β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16=362880 as before.

But wait, if [Co(SCN)_4]^− has charge -1, then the formula is Co(SCN)_4^- → Co^2+ +4 SCN^- → Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+, then [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, [Co(SCN)_4]^−2? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the charges wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach should include only up to [Co(SCN)_3]^-2, and the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is not considered. But the problem gives β4=16, so it should be included.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the fractions. Let me think differently.

Suppose I calculate the fraction for each complex and the free ion.

The fraction for each species is (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1...β4 [SCN]^4 )

So the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is (β1β2 [SCN]^2) / (sum of all terms).

Which is exactly what I did earlier.

Hmm. So maybe the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the complexes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total cobalt concentration includes all species except the free Co^2+. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the possibility of multiple isomeric forms or other factors, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the concentration of [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but the solution also includes H+ ions, but the problem doesn't mention acidity, so that's probably not relevant.

Another thought: perhaps the stability constants were given in reverse order. For example, perhaps β4 is the first step, etc. But that would change everything, and I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is at a certain pH, but the problem doesn't provide pH information, so that's probably not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me re-read it.

The problem says: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, wait! β4=16 is less than β3=63. That seems odd because βn typically increases with n up to a point. So perhaps β4 is for a different complex, like [Co(SCN)_3]^−2, and β4 is the stepwise constant from [Co(SCN)_3]^−2 to [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. But that doesn't change the approach.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are cumulative, but I think I already accounted for that.

Wait, maybe the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but it's the total concentration, including the complexes. No, because SCN is a ligand, and the free [SCN^-] would be much less. But that's a more complicated scenario, involving the formation of complexes with SCN, which would require solving more equations. But that's probably beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the complexes up to n=3, ignoring n=4. Let me try that.

If we ignore n=4, then the sum becomes 1 +0.9+3.6+22.68=28.18.

Then, [Co^2+] = c_total /28.18 =1e-2 /28.18≈3.55e-4 M.

Then, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] would be 3.6/28.18≈0.1277, or 12.77%. Still not matching any options.

Wait, but the options don't include that either. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] in all complexes, including the free Co^2+. So the fraction is 3.6/(sum 64.468) →5.55%, but that's still not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question meant to ask for the fraction of [Co(SCN)_3]^-2, not [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Because 35.18% is close to option A's 42.3%, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem includes the free Co^2+ in the denominator, but that's what I already did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but the actual free [SCN^-] is lower due to complexation. That complicates things, but perhaps I can estimate it.

Wait, but that would require setting up a system of equations, which is beyond the initial approach. Let me see if I can make progress.

Assume that the free [SCN^-] is significantly less than 0.1 M. Let me denote [SCN^-] as x. Then, the total [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which includes all forms: free and bound in complexes.

But this is getting complicated. Let me see if this approach is necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the free [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M, which is a common approximation when the ligand is in excess. So my initial approach holds.

Another thought: perhaps the sum of all terms is incorrect because I'm using the same β's as stepwise, but perhaps they are cumulative. Wait, no, because if they were cumulative, the way to calculate Kn would be different. For example, if β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, then β2 would be the overall for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on.

Wait, let's try that approach. If the β's are cumulative, then:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-2]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^2−]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )

In this case, each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

So, the [CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)_3^-2] = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4^2−] = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

So the total Co is:

c_total = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

Factor out [Co^2+]:

c_total = [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 )

So,

[Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 )

Now, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] is:

([Co(SCN)_2]) / c_total = (β2 [Co^2+][S]^2 ) / c_total = β2 [S]^2 / (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 )

Let me plug in the numbers.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[S]=0.1.

Compute each term:

Term0=1,

Term1=β1 [S]=9 *0.1=0.9,

Term2=β2 [S]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4,

Term3=β3 [S]^3=63 *0.001=0.063,

Term4=β4 [S]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum=1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

Now, the denominator is 2.3646.

The fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is Term2 / Sum = 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Because in this approach, β's are cumulative, not stepwise. But the problem statement says β1=9, etc., without specifying. So perhaps this is the correct approach.

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But why did this approach give a different result? Because now, β2 is 40, which is much smaller than the earlier approach where β2 was 360.

Wait, this makes sense if the β's are the overall formation constants, not stepwise. So in this case, each βn is the cumulative constant for that complex.

So, the answer would be option D)16.9%.

But wait, earlier when I thought the β's were stepwise, the fraction was 5.55%, but that didn't match any options. Now, assuming the β's are cumulative, the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

So this must be the correct approach.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, **[Co(SCN)₂]⁰**, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻ ions. The total cobalt concentration is **c_total = 10⁻² M**, and the free thiocyanate concentration is **[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M**.

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Stability Constants as Cumulative Formation Constants**:  
   The given β values are interpreted as cumulative formation constants for the respective complexes:
   - β₁ = [CoSCN⁺]/([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])  
   - β₂ = [Co(SCN)₂⁰]/([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²)  
   - β₃ = [Co(SCN)₃²⁻]/([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³)  
   - β₄ = [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]/([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)₂⁰}] + [\text{Co(SCN)₃²⁻}] + [\text{Co(SCN)₄²⁻}]
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for each species in terms of [Co²⁺], we get:
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right)
   \]
   Solving for [Co²⁺]:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c_{\text{total}}}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
   \]

3. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:  
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is given by:
   \[
   f_{\text{[Co(SCN)₂]⁰}} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)₂]⁰}}{c_{\text{total}}} = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
   \]

### Calculations:
1. **Compute Terms in the Denominator**:  
   Using β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16, and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M:
   - Term₀ = 1  
   - Term₁ = β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9  
   - Term₂ = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4  
   - Term₃ = β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063  
   - Term₄ = β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016  
   - **Sum = Term₀ + Term₁ + Term₂ + Term₃ + Term₄ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646**

2. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:  
   Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   f_{\text{[Co(SCN)₂]⁰}} = \frac{\text{Term₂}}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]
   Converting to percentage:
   \[
   f_{\text{[Co(SCN)₂]⁰}} \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, **[Co(SCN)₂]⁰**, among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.
