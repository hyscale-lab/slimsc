Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of some organic compound. Hmm, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. Maybe it's something like a diene or a conjugated system. But wait, I'm not sure about the structure, but maybe I don't need to draw it out. The question gives me some bond energies and asks for the enthalpy of formation, so I think I can approach this using bond energies and the concept of enthalpy of formation.

Wait, the formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the carbons. Let's see: each (CH3) group is three CH3 attached. Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of each type of bond.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recall: the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for that, I think I need to calculate the enthalpy change from all the bonds breaking and forming.

Alternatively, I remember the formula: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products). Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Or perhaps it's the reverse for formation. Let me think
