Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They ask for the minimum resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy of the particle is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the bubble chamber) will be longer due to time dilation. Oh right, the formula for that is τ = γ * τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), but since we're given E and m, maybe that's the way to go.

So first, I need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ. The energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = E/(m c²). But wait, since both are in GeV, the c² terms would cancel out when using the same units. Because E = γ m c², so γ is E/(m c²), but when E and m are in the same units (GeV), and c² is in (GeV²)/(mass unit squared), but perhaps the units will just cancel. Maybe I can ignore the actual units since they'll cancel out. So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 * 7 is 23.87, 3.41*8 is 27.28, which is a bit higher than 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. So gamma is roughly 7.91.

Next, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8e-16 * 8 is 64e-16, but wait, 7.91 is almost 8, so 8e-16 *7.91 is approximately 63.28e-16 seconds, which is 6.328e-15 seconds. So τ ≈ 6.33e-15 s.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, what does resolution mean here? I think it's the minimum distance the chamber can resolve, maybe the minimum track length that can be detected. But how does that relate to the lifetime?

The particles Y⁺ and Z⁻ would be produced when the X⁰ decays. The decay products will move, and the chamber can only detect them if they travel a certain distance before decaying. Wait, no, the X⁰
