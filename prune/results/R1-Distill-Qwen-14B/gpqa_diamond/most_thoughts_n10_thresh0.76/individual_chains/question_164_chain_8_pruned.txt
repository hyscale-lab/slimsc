Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are given as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, which I think refers to the orbital period of the binary system. So, the orbital period is the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other once.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes for each system. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, considering the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm. So, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses. The idea is that each star orbits the common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, hence a smaller velocity amplitude. The less massive star will move more, so higher velocity amplitude.

Wait, so the more massive star has a smaller RV amplitude. Because if one star is much heavier, it doesn't move as much, right? So in system_1, the stars have RVs of 10 and 5. So the star with 10 has lower mass than the one with 5? Wait, no, wait. No, that can't be right. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. Because it's like if you have two people on a see-saw. The heavier person doesn't have to move as much for the lighter one to go higher. So the heavier star has a smaller RV amplitude.

So in system_1, the two stars have RVs of 10 and 5. Let's say the star with 10 km/s is S1 and 5 is S2. So S1 is less massive than S2? Because S1 is moving more, so less mass. So S2 is more massive. Wait, no, wait. If the more massive star moves less, then the star moving more (10 km/s
