Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

First, let me read the problem again. The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so the options are about the relative speed and the total energy. I think I should tackle each part separately.

Starting with the relative speed. Oh right, when objects are moving at relativistic speeds, their relative speed isn't simply the difference of their velocities. Newtonian addition doesn't work here because of the speed limit c. I remember the formula for relativistic velocity addition.

The formula is v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c^2)), where u and v are the two velocities. Wait, but I need to be careful about the directions. Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, if I'm on the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at (u - v) divided by that gamma factor.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If astronaut A is moving at u =0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v=0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, actually, no. I think I have this backwards. Because the velocity addition formula is used when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So if I'm in the frame of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second?

Wait no, the astronauts are moving in the same direction. So their relative speed is not just 0.6c -0.5c =0.1c, because relativity doesn't work that way.

Wait, so the correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So substituting u as 0.6c and v as 0.5c.

Let me plug in the numbers. u =0.6c, v=0.5c. So numerator is (0.6c -0.5c)=0.1c. Denominator is 1 - ( (0.6c)(0.5c) ) / c².
