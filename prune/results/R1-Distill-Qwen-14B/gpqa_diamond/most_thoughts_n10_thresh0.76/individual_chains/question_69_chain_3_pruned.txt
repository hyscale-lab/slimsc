Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, right? The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, the lifetime they experience is their proper lifetime. But when we observe them, we have to consider their lifetime from our frame of reference because they're moving at relativistic speeds. Oh right, time dilation comes into play here. 

So the proper lifetime is τ₀, and the observed lifetime τ is γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to E divided by m c squared, right? Because for a particle, the total energy E is gamma m c². So gamma would be E/(m c²). But wait, what are the units here? The energy is given in GeV, and the mass is also in GeV. So maybe we can treat them as units where c=1, simplifying the calculation.

So let's compute gamma. E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.91. So gamma is about 7.91.

Now, the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so 63.28e-16 s, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

Next, I think we need to find the average decay length. The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying, which is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. The velocity of the particle is probably close to the speed of light since it's relativistic. So let's approximate v as c, which is about 3e8 m/s.

So decay length L = v * τ. Plugging in the numbers: 3e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s. Let's compute that: 3e8 * 6.328e-15 = (3*6.328) * 1e-7 = approx 18.984e-7 meters. Which is 1.8984e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. Oh, I see. The resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay products. If the decay length is too small, the tracks from Y⁺ and Z⁻ might merge, making it hard to see both. So the resolution must be such that we can see a track of at least 30% of the maximum possible decay length? Or maybe it's about the requirement that the decay is observed, so the minimum distance that the chamber can resolve needs to be smaller than the actual decay length so that the decay can be detected.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum detection resolution that allows observing at least 30% of the decay products. Or maybe it's about the minimum distance that the particle travels so that we can see the decay.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the decay probability. The decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. But the particle might decay earlier or later. To observe the decay, the chamber's resolution must be good enough to detect the decay point, which depends on the particle's velocity and the time it takes to decay.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution (like the smallest track length detectable) so that at least 30% of the decays are observed. Or maybe it's about the minimum speed or something else. Hmm, perhaps it's the minimum track length that the chamber can resolve. So the chamber can only detect decays that happen within a certain distance. So to capture at least 30% of the decays, the chamber's resolution must be such that 30% of the decay lengths are larger than the resolution. Or wait, maybe I need to find the minimum possible decay length that captures 30% of the decays.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the proper decay length. The particle could decay anywhere along its path. The probability of decaying at a distance x is determined by the exponential decay law: P(x) = 1 - e^{-x/L}, where L is the mean decay length.

Wait, no, actually, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance x is P = e^{-x/L}, where L is the mean decay length. To find the minimum x such that at least 30% of the particles have decayed beyond that point, I think that's when P(x) = 0.3. So 0.3 = e^{-x/L}, then take the natural log. ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397. So x = L * 1.20397.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The probability that the particle has decayed by a distance x is 1 - e^{-x/L}. So if we want at least 30% of the particles to have decayed (i.e., 0.3 probability), we set 0.3 = 1 - e^{-x/L}, so e^{-x/L} = 0.7. Then, x = -L ln(0.7). Let me compute that.

ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567. So x ≈ L * 0.3567.

Wait, no, wait, 0.7 is inside the ln. So x = L * ln(1/0.7) = L * ln(10/7) which is about ln(1.4286) ≈ 0.3567. So x = L * 0.3567. So the minimum resolution is such that the chamber can detect decays at least up to x, which is ~35.67% of the mean decay length L.

So L is the average decay length, which we calculated earlier as approximately 1.8984e-6 meters. So x = 0.3567 * 1.8984e-6 m.

Let me compute that: 0.3567 * 1.9e-6 ≈ 0.6777e-6 m, or 6.777e-7 m. Wait, but the options don't have that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution that the chamber must have so that it can detect at least 30% of the decays. So the decay length must be greater than the resolution. So the minimum resolution is the maximum possible decay length multiplied by 30%, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The proper lifetime is τ₀, so the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * τ₀. The mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * τ₀. Wait, earlier I assumed beta is 1, but perhaps beta is less than 1. Wait, no, the energy is given as 27 GeV. So we can compute beta.

Wait, E = gamma m c². And since beta is v/c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). Hmm, maybe I should compute beta more accurately.

Let me recompute gamma. E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. So gamma = E/(m
