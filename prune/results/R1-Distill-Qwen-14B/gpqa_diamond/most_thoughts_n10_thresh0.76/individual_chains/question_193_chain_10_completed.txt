Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through it carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So mathematically, that's N ∝ 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, but wait, actually, parallax is in arcseconds and distance is in parsecs. Oh right, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to relate N to distance. Since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then substituting that into the equation, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me write that down:

N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 )

So simplifying that, (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. Taking the reciprocal gives d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, but that can't be right because higher distances would mean more stars? Or am I mixing up something here.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So when a star is farther away, the parallax is smaller. So higher d means lower plx. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So as plx decreases, 1/plx increases. So N increases as plx decreases. So as distance increases, N increases. But how does N change with distance per unit range?

Hmm. The question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So we're looking for dN/dr, the rate of change of number of stars with respect to distance. Because, for example, if N increases with d^3, then dN/dr would be proportional to 3d^2.

Wait, but let's do this carefully. Let's express N as a function of d. So N = k * (d)^5, because 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is the constant of proportionality.

Now, the number of stars per unit distance (r) would be dN/dr. So taking the derivative of N with respect to d, we get:

dN/dr = 5k * d^4.

So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but why is this the case? Let me think about it conceptually. If the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance, then the rate of change (the slope) would be with the fourth power. Because the slope is the derivative, which is power reduced by one and multiplied by the exponent.

So, for example, if N ∝ d^n, then dN/dr ∝ n * d^(n-1).

In this case, n is 5, so dN/dr is 5*d^4, which is proportional to d^4. So the correct option is C, which is ~ r^4.

I think that makes sense. So the answer should be option C.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)) in parsecs, i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the equation for \( N \), we get:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5
\]

Thus, \( N \propto d^5 \). The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, which corresponds to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( d^4 \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**.

Answer: C
