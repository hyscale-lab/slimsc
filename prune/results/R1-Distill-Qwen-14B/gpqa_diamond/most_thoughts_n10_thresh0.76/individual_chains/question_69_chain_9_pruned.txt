Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I remember that particle physics can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what do I know about proper lifetime and decay? Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when we observe it, time dilation comes into play because the particle is moving. So the observed lifetime τ is longer than τ₀ by a factor of gamma (γ), which is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals the total energy divided by the rest mass energy, right?

So gamma = E / m. The energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate gamma first. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately... let's see, 3.41 times 7 is around 23.87, so 7.5 maybe? Because 3.41 * 7.6 is about 25.916, which is close to 27. So maybe gamma is around 7.9 or something. Let me compute it more accurately. 27 divided by 3.41: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 8 = 27.28. Oh wait, that's almost exactly 8. So 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. Let me compute 3.41 * 7.9. 3.41 * 7 =23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069. So 23.87 +3.069=26.939. Oh that's very close to 27. So gamma is approximately 7.9, maybe 7.92 or something. Let me just use 27 /3.41 ≈7.918. So gamma is about 7.918.

So the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ₀. So τ = gamma * τ₀ = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let's calculate that: 7.918 *8 is about 63.344, so 63.344e-16 s, which is 6.3344e-15 seconds.

But wait, how does this relate to the resolution? I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the resolution in the detector has to be good enough to see the decay products close enough in space. Because if the decay happens, and the particles Y and Z travel some distance before being detected, if the detector's resolution isn't good enough, you might not see the decay because it looks like they came from the same point.

So the minimum resolution needed probably refers to the length over which the decay products are produced. The longer the lifetime (because of time dilation), the further the particles can travel before being detected. So to observe the decay, we need to have the particles Y and Z not travel too far so that the detector can see them as originating from the same point.

Wait, the proper lifetime is the lifetime in the rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the particles Y and Z will travel a longer distance before decaying. But wait, in this case, the decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. So in the X⁰'s frame, the two particles go in opposite directions, maybe? But when we're in the lab frame, the X⁰ is moving, so the decay products might have a certain velocity and thus a certain length they travel before being detected.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so perhaps it's about the time it takes for the decay, and the distance the particles travel before detection. The idea is that the particles Y and Z fly a certain distance before the detector can register their tracks. If the detector's time resolution is too poor, it can't distinguish the timing of the decay, and thus can't see that the tracks come from the same point.

Wait, but I think I
