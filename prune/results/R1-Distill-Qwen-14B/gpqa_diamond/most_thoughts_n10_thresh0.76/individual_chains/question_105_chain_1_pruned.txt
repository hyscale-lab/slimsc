Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about a star covered in dark spots and how that affects its brightness variations compared to a planet transiting it. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is same as R_sun, right? The star has dark spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. Oh wait, the filling factor is 20%, which means that 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered in spots. But wait, since it's only one hemisphere, does that mean the total spotted area is 20% of the entire star's surface? Or is it 20% of the hemisphere? Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the surface covered, but here it's one hemisphere. Oh, maybe it's 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area covered would be 0.2 * (surface area of hemisphere). But the surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered would be 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, when the star rotates, only part of the spots become visible. But the problem says photometric variations are due to rotation, so maybe the spots are on one side, and as the star rotates, they come into view.

Wait, the question is about comparing this situation to a planet transiting the star. The scenario is that the spots cause a variation in brightness, but we want to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve if it were causing the dip instead. So we need to calculate the relative dip in brightness for both cases and set them equal.

First, let's think about the case with the planet. When a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the light. The dip in brightness is given by (Area of planet / Area of star) * (some factor?), wait, actually it's the ratio of the areas. Because when the planet covers a part of the star, the blocked light is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. So the fractional dip ΔF_planet would be (R_planet / R_star)^2.

But wait, actually, when the planet passes in front, it blocks a
