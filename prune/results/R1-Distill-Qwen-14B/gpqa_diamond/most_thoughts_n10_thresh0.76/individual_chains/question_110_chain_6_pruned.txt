Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key is that each spectrograph has different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. So any star that's brighter than 16 mag (since HIRES can't go fainter than that) can be detected by both if it's also within ESPRESSO's limit.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 with HIRES." So for a star to be detectable by both, it needs to be brighter than 17 mag? Because ESPRESSO can't see fainter than 17, but HIRES can't see fainter than 16. So if a star is brighter than 16, both can see it. Because, for example, a star with V=15 is brighter than both limits. So the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16, because if it's 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't. Wait, no, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So if a star has V=17, is that included? Because "brighter than" usually means magnitudes less than the value. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So, for instance, magnitude 17 is fainter than 16.

Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if something is brighter than V=17, that's V <17. So a star with V=16 is brighter than 17, so it's within both ESPRESSO and HIRES. Because HIRES can go down to 16, so anything brighter (i.e., V ≤16) can be observed by both.

Wait, let's clarify: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must satisfy V <16. Because if a star is V=16.5, it's fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. Wait, no, wait. No, wait: the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, so a star with V=16.5 is brighter than 17 (since 16.5 <17), so ESPRESSO can detect it. But for HIRES, the limit is brighter than 16, so V <16. So a V=16.5 star is fainter than 16, so
