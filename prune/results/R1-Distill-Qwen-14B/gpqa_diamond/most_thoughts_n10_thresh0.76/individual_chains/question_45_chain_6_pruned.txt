Okay, so I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle's energy depends on its quantum number, n.

Wait, but wait. The particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they are fermions. Oh right, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two can occupy the same quantum state. Each state is characterized by their quantum numbers and spin.

So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum state is determined only by the principal quantum number n, right? Because in 1D, there's no angular momentum (l=0), so the quantum number is just n.

But wait, wait again. For spin-1/2 particles, each can have two possible spin states: up or down. So each n level can hold two particles, one with each spin state.

So the potential well has energy levels En = E * n², where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). So En = (n²) * E.

Now, for four particles, how do their quantum numbers and spins look?

The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. Let's fill the lowest possible n's with as many particles as allowed by Pauli's exclusion.

Each n can have two particles (spin up and down). So starting from n=1, which can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more, since 2 particles fit. So for four particles: two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait. If we have four particles, all identical fermions, then each must have a unique combination of n and spin. So n=1 can have two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can also have two more (again spin up and down). So the four particles would occupy n=1 and n=2 levels.

Wait, but what about the total energy? Each particle's energy is En = n² E. So each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E.

So for the
