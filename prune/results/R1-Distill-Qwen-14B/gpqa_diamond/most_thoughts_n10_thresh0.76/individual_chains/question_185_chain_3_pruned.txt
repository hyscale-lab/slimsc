Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. So, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times sigma dot n. Sigma here is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. Oh right, sigma is a vector of the Pauli matrices, so sigma·n would be the dot product between sigma and n.

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So when you take the dot product with a unit vector n, which has components (n_x, n_y, n_z), the expression becomes n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Oh, right, that's a 2x2 matrix because the Pauli matrices are 2x2.

Now, the Hamiltonian H is ε multiplied by this matrix. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). I need to find the eigenvalues of this operator.

I remember that for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix like this, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Oh wait, but alternatively, there's a property of the Pauli matrices. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when you take a linear combination like sigma·n, what's its eigenvalue?

Wait, sigma·n is a spin operator in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of sigma·n would be the eigenvalues of each Pauli matrix scaled by their components. But wait, for a unit vector n, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. So maybe the matrix sigma·n has a squared magnitude equal to the identity matrix multiplied by 1.

Let me think: (sigma·n)² = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, each σ_i squared is identity (since σ_i^2 = I for each i), and the cross terms involve σ_i σ_j which anti-commute when i≠j.

Wait, but when you square sigma·n, the cross terms will involve terms like σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x, but wait, those terms when multiplied by n_x n_y would be 2i σ_z n_x n_y and similar for others. Wait, but when you square, all those terms will add up, but wait, when you
