Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it out.

The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right, the proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime, τ, depends on the particle's velocity and energy.

I remember that the lifetime observed is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ is equal to E / m₀ c², but since the units here might be in GeV, I need to be careful. Oh wait, the energy is given as 27 GeV, which is the total energy of the particle X⁰, right? Because in high-energy physics, energy often refers to the total energy.

So, the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV/c². So, E = 27 GeV, m₀ c² = 3.41 GeV. Therefore, γ = E / (m₀ c²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41*8=27.28. Oh wait, so 27 is just a tiny bit less than 8 times 3.41. So 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91. So γ is approximately 7.91.

Wait, but wait. Is E the total energy, which includes the rest mass? Yes, I think so. So that calculation is correct.

Now, the lifetime τ is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so τ ≈63.28e-16 seconds, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

But wait, the problem is about the resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber. The resolution relates to how well the decay vertex can be pinpointed. The minimum resolution needed to observe a certain percentage of decays would relate to the length of the particle's path before decaying, I think.

The decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = v * τ, where v is the velocity of the particle.

So I need to find v. Since v = β c, where β is v/c. To find β, I can use the relation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Rearranging that
