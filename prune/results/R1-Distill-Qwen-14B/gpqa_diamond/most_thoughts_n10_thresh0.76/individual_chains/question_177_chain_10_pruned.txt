Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. 

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's the peak wavelength. So for each star, their peak emission is at the same wavelength. Hmm, I remember from my notes that the peak wavelength is related to the temperature of the star. The formula is Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda is the same, then T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Now, the problem says that the radial velocities are zero for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. Oh, but when we talk about the Doppler effect, a higher radial velocity would shift the observed wavelength. But wait, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So does that mean that after considering their velocities, their observed lambda_max is the same?

Wait, maybe I should think about this. If Star_2 is moving towards or away from us (because radial velocity is 700 km/s), its observed wavelength would be Doppler-shifted. But if the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same, then the actual temperatures might be different. Wait, but earlier I thought their temperatures must be the same because lambda_max is the same for each. But if velocity is involved, that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, no. Each star's own lambda_max is determined by their own temperature. But when we observe them, the observed lambda would shift because of their velocities. So if the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars, that might not mean their actual temperatures are the same. Hmm, but the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, so we have to adjust for their velocities.

Wait,
