Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. So Y must be an element that can form multiple binary compounds with fluorine. Hmm, binary compounds usually mean different combinations of two elements, so Y must form YF, YF2, YF3, etc., but wait, five compounds in total. So perhaps Y could be something like phosphorus, which forms PF3 and PF5, but that's only two. Or maybe chlorine? No, wait, chlorine generally doesn't form more than one binary compound with fluorine. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal that can have multiple oxidation states.

Wait, let me think of elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, the noble gases can form many fluorides—like XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. Oh, but the problem says element Y, so Y is a single element. So Y must have multiple possible oxidation states. Another example is sulfur, which forms SF2, SF4, SF6, but wait, that's three. Hmm. Or maybe it's phosphorus: PF3, PF5. That's two. Hmm, not five. Wait, maybe it's another element. Oh, what about lead? Pb can form PbF2, PbF3, PbF4? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen? No, O's fluorides are limited. Wait, maybe it's a halogen like chlorine. ClF, ClF3, ClF5? But I'm not sure if all these are known. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says five binary compounds. So Y must form five different fluorides. Hmm, maybe Y is chlorine? I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen because O can form OF2 and O2F2, but that's only two. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's move on and see if more clues help.

The question goes on: substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is 20°C, room temp) into A2, where the oF (I think this stands for the oxidation state of fluorine, but maybe it's the percentage of fluorine) is 31.96%. Wait, oF is given as
