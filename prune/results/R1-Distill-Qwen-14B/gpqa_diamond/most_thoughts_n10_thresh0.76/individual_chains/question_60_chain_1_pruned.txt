Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about space travel and time dilation, right? So it's a relativity question. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's where time moves slower for the moving object relative to a stationary observer. But wait, I'm a bit confused about whose perspective we're considering here. Oh right, the question mentions the astronaut's point of view, so we'll need to use the time experienced by the astronaut, which involves the concept of proper time.

The scenario is this: aliens from the Large Magellanic Cloud are sending a spacecraft to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really close to c. The astronaut is 22 years old when they start the journey, and the question is asking how long it'll take from their perspective to reach Earth. The options are A to D, with A suggesting they die before getting there.

First, I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Wait, how far away is it? I remember that the approximate distance is about 160,000 light-years. But I'm not 100% sure, so I'll go with that for now.

So the distance is roughly 160,000 light-years. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, which is almost the speed of light. Let me calculate the time it takes from Earth's frame of reference first. Time is distance divided by speed. So time t_earth = distance / speed.

Let me write that out: t_earth = 160,000 ly / 0.99999987c. Wait, because the speed is a fraction of c, and the distance is in light-years, the time in years would just be 160,000 / 0.99999987. Let me compute that.

Hmm, so 0.99999987 is almost 1, so the time is about 160,000 years. Wait, that's a really long
