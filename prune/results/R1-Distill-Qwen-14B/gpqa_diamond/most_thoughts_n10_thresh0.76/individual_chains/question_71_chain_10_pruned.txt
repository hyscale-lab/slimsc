Okay, so I've got a question about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, and they're in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Also, all planets have the same albedo, so albedo isn't a factor here.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (a^2) / ( (1 - albedo) * (1 AU)² ) )^(-1/4) ). Wait, maybe I should think about it more simply. Oh right, the formula is T = T_earth * ( (P_earth / P_planet) )^(1/4) * sqrt( (1 - e) ), but since the orbits are circular, eccentricity e is zero. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, no. I think another way. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( (Luminosity of star) / ( (1 - albedo) * (4πσ) ) )^(1/4) multiplied by ( a )^(-1/2), where a is the orbital radius. Since all the planets orbit the same star, the L and star's parameters are the same for all. So the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse of their orbital distances. Hmm.

But wait, how do I relate their orbital periods to their distances? Because Kepler's third law comes into play here. Kepler's law says that (P^2) / (a^3) = constant, where the constant depends on the star's mass. Since all planets are orbiting the same star, the constant is the same for all. So, for each planet, P^2 is proportional to a^3. Or, a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, if I have the ratio of periods, I can find the ratio of their distances. Let me denote the periods as P1, P2, ..., P5 with ratios 1,2,2.5,3.5,5. Let me call the
