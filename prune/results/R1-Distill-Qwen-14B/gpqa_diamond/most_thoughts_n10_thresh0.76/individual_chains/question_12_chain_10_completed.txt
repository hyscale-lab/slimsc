Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about particle physics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion (Pi+) at rest decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The given data includes the rest masses: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. 

Wait, the reaction is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. And since the pion is at rest, that simplifies things a bit. I remember that in particle decays, energy and momentum must be conserved. But since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero, so the outgoing particles' momenta must cancel each other. 

So, when the Pi+ is at rest, it will decay into the muon and the neutrino. The neutrino is massless, I think. So the muon must carry some momentum, and the neutrino the opposite. But how does that help me find their kinetic energies?

Let me think about energy conservation. The rest energy of the pion is all that's available because it's stationary. So, the total energy after decay must equal the rest energy of the pion. 

The rest energy of the pion is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the muon and neutrino have their rest energies plus kinetic energy. The neutrino has rest mass zero, so its energy is just kinetic, but the muon has rest mass.

So, the total energy after decay is the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's energy. 

Wait, the muon's total energy is its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because it has no rest mass. 

But wait, since the pion is at rest, the decay products must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Let me denote the energies. Let’s let E_mu be the muon's total energy and E_nu be the neutrino's energy. 

So, E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. 

But the momentum of each must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, the momentum p_mu is equal in magnitude to p_nu. 

The energy of each particle is related to their momentum and rest mass. For the muon, E_mu² = (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)². For the neutrino, since m_nu is zero, E_nu = p_nu c. 

But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), let's set p as the magnitude of their momenta. 

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )
E_nu = p c 

So, the sum is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = 139.6 MeV.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can solve for p. Let's let x = p c. Then the equation becomes sqrt(x² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + x = M_pi c².

Wait, m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², and M_pi is 139.6 MeV/c². So let me plug in the numbers. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity, so units are in MeV.

So, m_mu = 105.7 MeV, M_pi =139.6 MeV.

Equation becomes: sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Let me subtract x from both sides: sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides: x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expand the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So, x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides: 105.7² = 139.6² - 2 *139.6 x.

Hmm, let's compute the squares.

105.7^2 is approximately 11,172.49.

139.6^2 is about 19,488.16.

So, 11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So, 11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2 x.

Rearranging: 279.2 x = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49.

Compute 19,488.16 - 11,172.49. Let's see:

19,488.16 - 11,172.49 = 8,315.67.

So, 279.2 x = 8,315.67.

x = 8,315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me calculate that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2 approximately. Let's see, 279.2 * 30 = 8,376, which is a bit higher than 8315. So maybe around 29.8 or so.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 * 30 = 8,376, but 29.8 is 0.2 less. So 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84. So 8,376 -55.84 = 8,320.16. Hmm, which is a bit higher than 8,315.67. So perhaps a little less than 29.8.

Wait, let me compute 279.2 * 29.7 = ?

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 8,096.8. 279.2 *0.7= 195.44. So 8,096.8 +195.44 = 8,292.24. Which is smaller than 8,315.67. Let's compute 29.7 + (8,315.67-8,292.24)/(279.2).

The difference is 23.43. So 23.43 /279.2 ≈ 0.084. So x ≈ 29.7 + 0.084 ≈ 29.784.

So approximately x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but x is p c. So p = x / c. But since we're working in units where c=1, p is just x. So p is about 29.78 MeV/c. 

But wait, I think I miscalculated. Because 29.78 would give x=29.78, but let's double-check.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.784 = let's compute 279.2 *29.7 = 8,292.24, plus 279.2 *0.084 = approximately 23.43. So 8,292.24 +23.43≈8,315.67, yes that adds up.

So x is approximately 29.78 MeV.

So the neutrino's energy E_nu = x = 29.78 MeV.

The muon's total energy E_mu = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(29.78² + 105.7²).

29.78 squared is about 886.8, 105.7 squared is 11,172.49. Sum is 12,059.29.

Square root of 12,059.29 is about 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but 109.8 is the muon's total energy. Its rest mass is 105.7, so the kinetic energy is 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV, approximately.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me compute that again. 109.8 minus 105.7 is 4.1 MeV. So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. 

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me recheck the calculations because sometimes when I subtract, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the neutrino's energy is about 29.78 MeV, and the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's matching.

Wait, but the options are provided as pairs, with the first the KE of the muon and the second that of the neutrino? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the question says "KE of product particles in Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu." So the products are mu+ and nu. So the KE of mu+ is 4.1 MeV, and the KE of nu is 29.8 MeV. So option D has 4.12 and 29.8, so that should be the correct answer.


To determine the kinetic energies of the decay products in the reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest mass of the pion is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\), and the rest mass of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) is \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is massless.

### Energy Conservation
The total energy of the system before and after the decay must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is equal to its rest energy:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (\(E_{\mu}\)) and the neutrino's energy (\(E_{\nu}\)):

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]

The muon's total energy is related to its momentum (\(p_{\mu}\)) and rest mass by:

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}.
\]

The neutrino's energy is purely kinetic since it is massless:

\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c.
\]

Since momentum is conserved and the pion is stationary, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:

\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

Let \(x = p_{\mu} c\). Substituting into the energy conservation equation:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6.
\]

### Solving for \(x\)
Subtract \(x\) from both sides:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]

Square both sides:

\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expand and simplify:

\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2.
\]

Cancel \(x^2\) and rearrange:

\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]

\[
279.2x = 8315.67.
\]

Solve for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the neutrino's energy is:

\[
E_{\nu} = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's total energy is:

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:

\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
