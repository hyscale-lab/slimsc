Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f_bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more clearly. Probably, it's a Yukawa-like interaction term. So, the Lagrangian term suggests that the boson X couples to fermions. The term λ f f_bar ψ X ψ_f would imply that X interacts with fermion fields ψ and ψ_f. Wait, maybe the notation is a bit different. Let me think: the term is something like λ f ψ_bar (v + X) ψ. Oh right, so X is a boson field, and f is a Yukawa coupling parameter, perhaps. Or maybe f is a fermion field, but the notation is a bit confusing. But the key point is that the boson X interacts with some fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermions can be produced when X decays, based on their masses.

So, X can decay into pairs of fermions. Because in the Standard Model, a boson like a scalar (assuming X is a scalar here) would decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The rule is that the total energy must be at least twice the mass of the fermions.

Wait, but since the X is decaying, its rest mass (6 GeV) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because each fermion in the pair would need to have energy equal to at least their rest mass energy.

So, the possible decay products are fermions with mass m where 2m <= 6 GeV. So m <= 3 GeV.

I need to list all the known fermions with masses less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let me remember the masses of the fermions.

The fermions in the Standard Model are:

Leptons: electrons (m ~ 0.0005 GeV), muons (0.105), taus (1.78 GeV).

Quarks: up, down (light), strange, charm, bottom, top.

Masses (approximate):

Up and down quarks: about 2 MeV each (so <<1 GeV, way less than 3 GeV).

Strange: around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV).

Charm: around 1.5 GeV.

Bottom (beauty): around 4.5 GeV.

Top: way heavier, around 173 GeV.

So, for fermions that X can decay into, their mass must be <= 3 GeV. So possible fermions are:

- Electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ) in leptons. Wait, tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is fine. Electrons and muons are way below 3 GeV.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm. Their masses are all below 3 GeV. But wait, their masses are much lower, but when considering decay products, the problem is whether the X can produce a pair. So, for each quark q, X can decay into q q_bar. But wait, because when a boson decays into quarks, you have to consider whether the process is possible. But in terms of kinematics, it depends on the mass.

But wait, in the Standard Model, for a scalar boson like the Higgs, it can decay into any fermion pair as long as the sum is less than its mass. So for X here, same applies.

So, possible fermion pairs are:

Leptons:

- e+ e-
- μ+ μ-
- τ+ τ-

But wait, tau is 1.78 GeV; so pair is 3.
