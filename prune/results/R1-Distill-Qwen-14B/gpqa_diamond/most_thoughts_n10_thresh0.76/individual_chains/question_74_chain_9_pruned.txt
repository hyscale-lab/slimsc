Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to think it through. So the question says that we have an atom, and we know that the probability of it decaying within 100 minutes is 32%. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm. Wait, so radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So the key thing here is that the decay is memoryless. That means the probability of it decaying in the next period doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay. So if it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the chance it decays in the next, say, 150 minutes is the same as if we started monitoring it fresh. Or wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial information is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the decay constant lambda would relate to the half-life or the decay probability. Let me recall the formula. The probability of decay in time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-lambda t). Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, the decay law is N(t) = N0 * e^(-lambda t). So the probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-lambda t). Alternatively, the survival probability is e^(-lambda t).

So the given data is that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is
