Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when different solutions are mixed. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the problem states that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization typically involves an acid reacting with a base to form water and salt. The enthalpy change is usually around -57 kJ per mole for strong acids and bases, but I need to check if that applies here.

Wait, so first, I should figure out how much acid and base we have. Each acid will donate H+ ions, and the base will donate OH- ions. The neutralization will depend on the moles of H+ and OH- available.

Let me break it down. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but since it's diprotic, each mole will give two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

Calculating the moles for each solution:

For HCl:
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Molarity = 0.2 M
Moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

For H2SO4:
Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
Molarity = 0.3 M
Moles = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+ (since each gives 2 H+).

For Ba(OH)2:
Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L
Molarity = 0.5 M
Moles = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH- (since each gives 2 OH^-).

Wait, so total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. And OH- is 0.2 mol. 

But wait, when an acid and base react, H+ and OH- combine to form water. The limiting reagent here is the one with the lesser mole, I think. So let's see, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant because 0.2 is less than 0.28.

So the reaction will proceed until all OH- is used up. How much H+ will that consume? Each OH- needs one H+ to make H2O. So 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So the available H+ is 0.28. So after reaction, 0.08 mol H+ remains unreacted. OH- is all used up.

Wait, but the neutralization reaction involves H+ and OH- combining. So the total enthalpy change depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that react. So even though we have excess H+, the OH- is the limiting factor here, so the reaction only involves 0.2 mol of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let's think again. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, all the H+ and OH- will react as much as possible. But the key is to find the net moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and total OH-.

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol.

When you mix them, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So the moles that react are the lesser of the two, which is 0.2 mol.

So the reaction will produce 0.2 mol of water, but wait, the neutralization could be 1:1.

So the enthalpy change is based on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react. So in this case, 0.2 mol of H+ (from the acids) will react with 0.
