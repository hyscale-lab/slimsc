Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question describes a point charge q moving along some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity at the generation time is v. We need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr.

Wait, so the setup is about retarded potentials because the fields are based on the charge's position and velocity in the past. Right, retarded time makes sense here because the fields propagate at the speed of light.

I remember that the scalar potential V is usually given by (q/(4πε₀)) times something divided by the distance. But when the charge is moving, there's a correction factor involving the velocity. Oh right, the scalar potential is like q/(4πε₀) multiplied by 1/(r'), where r' is the distance at the retarded time. But wait, the exact formula—maybe I should recall the expressions for retarded potentials.

Wait, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1 / |r - (v * (t - tr)/c)| ), but wait, no, more accurately, the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1 / ( |d| sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ) ] ? No, that doesn't sound right. Or maybe it's 1/(r) multiplied by a factor involving the velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (r (1 - (v²/c²))^(1/2) ) ]? Wait, no, I think that's for the static case when the charge is at rest, it's just q/(4πε₀ r). But when it's moving, the denominator gets adjusted by the Lorentz contraction or something.

Wait, wait, from what I remember, the scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by:

V(r, t)
