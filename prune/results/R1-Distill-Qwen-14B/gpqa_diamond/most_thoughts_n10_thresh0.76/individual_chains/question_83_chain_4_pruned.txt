Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we're doubling the volume by adding 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acetic acid. So the volume after dilution is 40 cm³.

Wait, how does dilution affect concentration? Oh right, M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, during the titration with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base, so it'll dissociate completely). The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, but wait, after dilution, the moles of acetic acid are M2 * V2 (but wait V is in liters, so maybe I should convert cm³ to liters? Or perhaps just use the same units since they'll cancel out, but better to be precise).

Wait, let me calculate the moles of acetic acid after dilution. The volume after dilution is 40 cm³ = 0.04 L. So moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Wait, wait, acetic acid's initial moles before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After diluting to 0.04 L, same moles, so 0.001 mol. Yep.

Now, when titrating, each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added = 0.001 mol.

What's the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence? The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So M = moles / volume → volume = moles / M. So volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, the pH at equivalence. Since acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, the equivalence point will form the sodium acetate solution, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic.

So the pH at equivalence is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH3COO^-). Let's find the concentration of acetate.

The total volume at equivalence is the volume of acetic acid solution plus NaOH added. So 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol (same as initial acetic acid). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (A^-) will hydrolyze in water: A^- + H2O ↔ HA + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is about 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M. Now, the hydrolysis equation:

Kb = [HA][OH^-] / [A^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], we have:

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0
