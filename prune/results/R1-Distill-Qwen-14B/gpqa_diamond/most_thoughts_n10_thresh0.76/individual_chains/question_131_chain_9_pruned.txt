Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. The first step is dehydration to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: major and minor. Both have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. 

The key part here is the NMR data. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in 13C. Then, the major and minor products are analyzed using 2D NOESY NMR. The major has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't, or it's very weak. The question is about which two resonances are connected in the major product's spectrum.

Let's break this down. First, let's think about the starting material. A dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride would depend on the dicarboxylic acid. For dehydration, typically, the acid loses water to form the anhydride. 

The anhydride's NMR data: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's upfield for protons, but wait, 7 ppm is actually more downfield. Wait, but 7 ppm is more like aromatic protons, but wait, maybe it's an alkyne or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring, but the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene. Hmm. Wait, the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak. So, perhaps it's a symmetrical structure. Maybe the protons are all equivalent. 

The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is around where a carbonyl might be, but wait, anhydrides have two carbonyl groups. Wait, but wait, if the anhydride is formed from a cis-dicarboxylic acid, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride. Let's think: If the starting acid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's trans. Wait, no, the starting acid has a cis-alkene, so maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH no, wait, no, wait, the starting acid has a cis-alkene, so it's a diacid with a double bond. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no, the double bond is in the chain. Oh, like HOOC-CH
