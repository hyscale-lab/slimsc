Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I've heard that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgeheads. Then, it's heated with excess KOH. Hmm, KOH is a strong base, so maybe an elimination reaction is happening here. Oh wait, when vicinal dihalides (like two adjacent halogens) are treated with a base, they usually eliminate to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't adjacent, it's 1 and 3 positions apart. So maybe it's a different kind of elimination. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation but in a way that forms a bridge. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, but in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons. So when you have two bromines at 1 and 3, perhaps heating with KOH would cause each Br to eliminate, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, how does that work in a structure like adamantane? Maybe each Br leaves, and the structure rearranges to form an alkene. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact product here. Let me think, the initial product is a light yellow solid. The NMR data might help. The 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably an OCH2 group. The IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (like ketone or ester). So maybe the product is a ketone.

Wait, KOH is a base, and if it's causing elimination, perhaps it's a double elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but with KOH and heat, elimination is more likely. Oh wait, but if 1,3-dibromo adamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes two eliminations, losing two equivalents of
