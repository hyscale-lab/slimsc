Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same everywhere in space. Wait, no—uniformly distributed in the sky. Oh, maybe it's about their apparent distribution as seen from Earth. So, perhaps the number of stars per unit area on the celestial sphere is uniform.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax plx is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit as seen from the star, so plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So higher parallax means closer stars.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So for a given range of parallax values, how does the count change as plx changes?

I remember something about the distribution of stars in terms of distance. Since the number of stars depends on the volume of space, and volume depends on the cube of the distance, maybe that's relevant here.

Let me think: the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d+Δd would be proportional to the surface area of the shell times the thickness (Δd), multiplied by the star density. If the density is uniform, then the number is proportional to 4πd² * Δd. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and the shell's thickness is Δd.

But wait, the number of stars per unit parallax isn't directly given by that. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So if I let p = plx, then d = 1/p. So the volume element in terms of p would need to be calculated.

Let me rephrase the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness Δd. That's 4πd² Δd multiplied by the number density of stars, which is uniform. Let's say number density is n stars per cubic parsec.

So the number of stars is N = n * 4πd² Δd.

But since we need to express this in terms of parallax p, and p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let's substitute d in terms of p.

So, N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 Δd. Hmm, but Δd is in terms of d. Let me express Δd in terms of Δp.

Wait, because d = 1/p, so when p changes by Δp, d changes from d to d + Δd, which is (1/(p+Δp)). But for small Δp, the change in d can be approximated. Let's see: Δd ≈ (Δp) * (d²) because p = 1/d → dp = - (1/d²) dd → so dd = -d² dp. Since Δp is a small change, Δd ≈ d² Δp. But wait, wait, let me get the exact relation.

If p = 1/d → d = 1/p. So when p increases by Δp, d decreases by Δd = 1/(p + Δp) -
