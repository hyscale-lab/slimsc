Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. I need to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the given spectral data. The options are A, B, C, D. Hmm, I should probably break this down step by step.

First, let me look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. That's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 2 oxygens. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. So (20 -11)/2 = 9/2. Oh, wait, 2*9 is 18 plus 2 is 20. 20 minus 11 is 9, plus 1 (because N is 1) gives 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, like, a benzene ring (which is three) plus maybe an ester group or something else. Or maybe a double bond and a ring.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Oh wait, but sometimes they can be O-H too. But O-H in carboxylic acids are usually broader. So if I see two bands around 3400, that might suggest either N-H or maybe an amide or amine. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. That could be ester, amide, ketone, or maybe an acid. But the molecular formula has an O2 and N, so maybe it's an ester or amide.

In the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm triplet, 3H: that's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something else. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe an ethyl ester, where the CH2 is next to another CH2.

4.0 ppm broad singlet, 2H: a broad singlet. That could be an NH2 group, but wait, if it's a singlet, maybe it's an NH adjacent to something else. Or maybe an OCH2 group? Wait, OCH2 typically is around 3.3-4.0, but a singlet suggests no neighboring Hs. Alternatively, maybe a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom, like oxygen or nitrogen. But since it's a singlet and broad, perhaps it's an amine. Or maybe a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, but coupling isn't observed.

4.5 ppm quartet, 2H: quartet implies coupling with two neighboring protons. So that's maybe another CH2 group. If the triplet at 1.2 is an ethyl group, then maybe 4.5 is a CH2 connected to something like an oxygen. Like an OCH2CH2O group? Wait, but looking at the integration, 4.5 is 2H, so maybe it's -OCH2- attached to another CH2.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 8.0 ppm doublet (2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the doublets would be adjacent to each other in a para-substituted ring. So if it's para-substituted, two substituents on the ring in the para positions. Wait, but wait, each doublet is two H. So perhaps the substituents are on adjacent positions? No, in para substitution, each substituent is across from each other. So the doublets at 7 and 8 ppm would be the two sets of aromatic protons. For example, if the ring has two substituents in para
