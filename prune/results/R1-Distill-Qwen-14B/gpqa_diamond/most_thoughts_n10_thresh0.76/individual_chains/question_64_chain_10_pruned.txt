Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question involves heating a mixture of salts, and then passing the resulting gases through several tubes. The data from each tube's weight change will help me determine what's going on.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are then passed through three tubes. Tube 1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution, and tube 3 has red-hot copper.

The results are: tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, tube 3 gained 0.80 grams, and tube 2 didn't change weight. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Alright, let me start by analyzing each part. First, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose to form gases. The gases pass through these tubes, and each reacts with something in the tube. 

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 is used, which is a strong desiccant and can react with water, but more importantly, it's often used to absorb moisture. But wait, another possibility is that it can react with acidic gases like HCl. Because Mg(ClO4)2 is a Lewis acid and can act as a drying agent, but I think more importantly, if the gas is something like HCl, it would react with Mg(ClO4)2. The formula for this reaction might be something like Mg(ClO4)2 + HCl → MgCl2 + 2 HClO4. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, Mg(ClO4)2 could react with water, but in this case, the gas might be a water-containing vapor or something else.

But wait, the tube's weight increased by 3.60 grams. So whatever reacted with tube 1 added that much mass. Let's think: if the gas was HCl, then Mg(ClO4)2 would react. Let's see:

Mg(ClO4)2 (s) + 2 HCl (g) → MgCl2 (s) + 2 HClO4 (l or s?)

Wait, perhaps more accurately, Mg(ClO4)2 as a solid (anhydrous) would react with water. Alternatively, if the gas is steam, but then Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, leading to an increase in mass. Let me think—HCl is a possible gas that could be captured by Mg(ClO4)2. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe the gas is a combination of HCl and H2O vapor? Or perhaps it's more likely that Mg(ClO4)2 is acting as a drying agent, so the gas might be water vapor, but that seems less likely because HCl is more reactive. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is NH3,
