Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, let's read the problem again and see what it's about.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were passed through several tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results were that tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, tube 3 gained 0.80 grams, and tube 2 didn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure. The question is the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. So, first, I need to figure out what's happening in each of these tubes. Let me think about each reagent and what kind of reactions they might cause.

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is anhydrous. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent. It can react with water, especially in the presence of heat. So when a gas passes through it, if there's any water vapor, it would be absorbed. But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is used in drying tubes because it can absorb moisture. So if the gas mixture had water vapor, tube 1 would gain weight. But in our case, tube 1's weight increased by 3.60 grams. So the gas must have had water, which was absorbed by the Mg(ClO4)2.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. Ca(OH)2 is a base; it reacts with acids to form salt and water. If the gas had CO2, for example, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But if the weight didn't change, perhaps there was no CO2. Alternatively, maybe the gas didn't react with the solution. Wait, but at high temperatures, if the gas were something else, like NH3, it might not react with Ca(OH)2 in a way that would cause a precipitate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas wasn't acidic enough to react.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. The copper is probably in the form of CuO, right? When gases pass over hot copper, certain reactions can occur. For example, CO would react with CuO to form CO2 and Cu. Or maybe H2 could reduce CuO to Cu. But in this case, the weight increased by 0.80 grams. Wait, but if CuO is formed, that suggests that the gas was carrying some reducing agent that reacted with CuO? Or maybe the gas itself was H2 or CO, which reduced CuO. Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

If a gas passed through red-hot copper and caused an increase in weight, that suggests that the gas was reacting with the copper, perhaps adding oxygen. Or maybe the gas was H2, which would reduce CuO to Cu, but in that case, the copper would gain mass. Wait, that's interesting. Because CuO is formed, I think the reaction might be something like CO reacting with CuO. Let's see: CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. So the mass change would be the difference between the mass of CO and CuO. Wait, but in that case, if 1 mole of CO (28 g/mol) reacts, it produces 1 mole of CuO (80 g/mol). So the increase in mass would be 80 - 28 = 52 g. But that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe it's H2. H2 + CuO → Cu + H2O. The mass change here would be the mass of CuO formed minus the H2. For each mole of H2 (2 g), you get 80 g of CuO. So the change would be 80 - 2 = 78 g per mole. But the measured change is 0.80 grams. Hmm, perhaps the amount of gas is small.

Wait, but let me think about the gases. The initial mixture after heating the salts is a mixture of gases. These gases pass through the tubes, and the only gas left is 2.24 L of gas C. Since it's at standard temperature and pressure (STP), 2.24 L would be 0.1 mol (because 22.4 L is 1 mol). So gas C is 0.1 mol.

Now, let's consider each part. The gases from the salts after heating. Maybe the salts decompose into different gases. Let's think of possible salts that when heated would release gases like H2O, CO2, NH3, SO2, H
