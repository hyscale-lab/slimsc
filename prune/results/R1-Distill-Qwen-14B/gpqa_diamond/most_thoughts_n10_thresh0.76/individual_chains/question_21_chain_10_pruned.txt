Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the real focus is on two parts: part A and part B. Part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The options are given, and I have to choose between A, B, C, D.

First, I need to understand what each part is asking.

Starting with part A: The compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which one doesn't show tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair (like in a keto-enol tautomerism), leading to different structural isomers. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, sometimes there's enol tautomerism. But not all compounds do that.

Benzoquinone â€“ I remember that quinones are cyclic ketones. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Quinones are known for their keto forms. Wait, but can they undergo tautomerism?

Wait, no, tautomerism usually involves the movement of a hydrogen from one position to another, causing a change in the double bonds or lone pairs. But quinones have two ketone groups. Do they have the possibility for enol tautomerism?

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at the 1,3,5 positions. So it's like a cyclic triketone. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism?

Wait, if a compound has multiple ketone groups, can they tautomerize? Let me think. Tautomerism typically occurs in compounds that have adjacent carbonyl groups or in positions where a hydrogen can shift leading to a different structure. For example, in a diketone, maybe.

But in the case of benzoquinone, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other (para positions). Each carbonyl group is at para positions on the benzene. So each is attached to a benzene carbon, so they're not adjacent. So maybe each can't tautomerize because the hydrogen isn't in a position to shift.

Wait, but benzoquinone is a dienophile. Wait, that's another property, but that's not relevant here. Back to tautomerism.

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups that are alternated. So each is separated by a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure allows for some shifting of hydrogens, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds can exhibit enol tautomerism. Enol tautomerism occurs when a carbonyl group can form an enol. For that, the alpha position (the carbon next to carbonyl) must have a hydrogen that can move. So, if the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, like in a diketone, the alpha carbons would have hydrogens.

Wait, benzoquinone has two ket
