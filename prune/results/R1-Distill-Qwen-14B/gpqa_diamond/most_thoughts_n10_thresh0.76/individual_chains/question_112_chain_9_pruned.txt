Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is. 

The problem states that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I think that means it's a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states for the z-component. And we're told that up and down are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operators for a particle like an electron have eigenstates |up> and |down> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively for the S_z operator. But wait, the question is about another operator with a different matrix representation. 

The operator in question has elements A_ij. The matrix is such that A_ij is ℏ/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so I need to figure out what this operator looks like in the computational basis. Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the Hilbert space is two-dimensional, so the operator is a 2x2 matrix. 

Let me think, the indices i and j probably run from 1 to 2, representing the up and down states. So for a 2x2 matrix, the elements would be:

A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1), 
A_12 = ℏ/2 (i=1, j=2),
A_21 = ℏ/2 (i=2, j=1),
A_22 = 0 (i=j=2).

So the matrix would look like:
[ 0 , ℏ/2 ]
[ ℏ/2, 0 ]

Wait, but that's a symmetric matrix. Oh, right, because A_ij = A_ji for i≠j. So this operator is equal to (ℏ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). That's interesting because this is the form of the spin-x operator, S_x, except for a factor. Because S_x is (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). So this operator A is exactly S_x. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of S_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. 

So the problem is asking about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, which are the eigenstates of S_x. Then also, find the average value of this operator A, which is the expectation value of S_x for the given state |alpha>.

Wait, but first I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional. So I'll calculate the normalization factor. 

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The normalization requires that the inner product <alpha|alpha> equals 1. So let's compute that.

The inner product is (1-i)(2+i) + (2 + i)(1 - i) because when you compute <alpha|alpha>, you take the complex conjugate of each component. So,

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)*(2 + i) = 1*2 + 1*i - i*2 - i*i = 2 + i - 2i - i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 2 - i +1 = 3 - i.

Wait, wait, let's compute it correctly. I think I made a mistake in expanding. Let me do it again. (1 - i)(2 + i) = 1*2 + 1*i + (-i)*2 + (-i)*i. So that's 2 + i - 2i - i². i² is -1. So 2 + i - 2i +1 = 3 - i.

Second term: (2 + i)*(1 - i) = 2*1 + 2*(-i) + i*1 + i*(-i) = 2 -2
