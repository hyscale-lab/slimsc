Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and energy calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

So the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We're supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay. So the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. Therefore, after fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Since momentum is mass times velocity, and they have different masses, their velocities must be inversely proportional to their masses.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial mass: M
- Rest-mass energy: 300 GeV. So, the rest energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. But I'll probably need the mass in terms of energy units, so maybe that's fine.

After fission:
- Let the two fragments have masses m1 and m2.
- Given m1 = 2 * m2. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh, the problem says "one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other". So, perhaps m1 is twice m2. Or wait, the wording says "the more massive fragment." So, m1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2*m2.

But wait, the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

But m1 is 2*m2. So substituting:

2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M.

Wait, no: 3*m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So m1 = 2*0.33 M = 0.66 M.

So the two masses are m1
