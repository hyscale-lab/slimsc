Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Right, the problem says there's a spacecraft going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. Oh wait, but the question is whether they'll make it before they die. Their average lifetime is about 150 solar years, so 150 Earth years.

Wait, but this is from the astronaut's point of view. So I need to calculate the time experienced by them, which involves time dilation. Because when you travel at speeds close to light speed, time slows down for you relative to someone else.

So I remember that the formula for time dilation is based on the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But wait, v is a big fraction of c here. Let me think, v is 0.99999987c. That's like 99.999987% the speed of light. So v is very close to c.

Calculating gamma for such a high velocity. Let me see. 1 - (v/c)^2 would be 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. Let's see, (0.
