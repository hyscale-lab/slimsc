Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again. The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. They want to know the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a volume and a pH value.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. When you add an acid to it, it should react to form a salt and water. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl (a strong monobasic acid) to produce FeCl3 and water. Let me write that down.

The reaction equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide. So, each Fe(OH)3 would need three H+ ions from the acid to neutralize the OH-.

So the balanced equation is: Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

Right. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl for complete dissolution.

Now, first, I need to calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Let's see, Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So each Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). So:

Fe: 55.85 g/mol
Each OH: 16 + 1 = 17 g/mol, so 3 * 17 = 51 g/mol for the three OH groups.
Total molar mass: 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that more accurately: 0.1 divided by 106.85. Hmm, 106.85 is approximately 107, so 0.1/107 ≈ 0.0009346. Let's say approximately 0.000935 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:3, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.000935 ≈ 0.002805 mol.

Wait, but wait. The acid is 0.1 M. So, the volume of acid needed is moles divided by concentration. So, M = moles/volume (in liters). So volume (in liters) = moles / M.

So, volume = 0.002805 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02805 L, which is 28.05 cm³. Oh, because 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 0.02805 L is 28.05 cm³. That's the minimum volume needed, assuming complete dissolution.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the total volume? The question says the total volume is 100 cm³. That's the final volume after adding the acid. So, when I add some volume 'V' of acid to 100 cm³, the total volume is 100 + V? Or is it just 100 cm³? Let me read the question again.

The problem states: "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So, the final solution has a total volume of 100 cm³. So, when we add the acid, the volume of the solution is 100 cm³. So, we can't just use the volume of acid as 28.05 cm³, because adding that much would make the total volume more than 100 cm³. Hmm, that complicates things. So, perhaps I need to consider that the acid's volume contributes to the total solution volume.

Wait, no. The problem says that the total volume is 100 cm³. So, the acid is added to the solution, and the total volume after adding should be 100 cm³. So, the volume of the acid is (100 cm³) minus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution. Wait, but what's the volume of Fe(OH)3 before adding acid? The problem says we have a 100 cm³ total volume. Hmm, perhaps the initial volume is 100 cm³, and when we add the acid, the total volume remains 100 cm³. So, maybe the acid's volume is negligible? Or perhaps the problem assumes that the volume change is negligible. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final solution volume after adding the acid. 

Wait, the problem states: "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So, the solution after dissolving has a total volume of 100 cm³. So, when adding the acid, the volume of the acid (V_acid) plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 (maybe in some solvent) equals 100 cm³. But wait, the Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so perhaps it's dissolved in some solution, but the total volume is 100 cm³. Alternatively, maybe the 100 cm³ is just the final solution volume. So, perhaps the acid volume is part of that 100 cm³. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, if the problem says the 'total volume' is 100 cm³, that suggests that after adding the acid, the solution's volume is 100 cm³. So, the volume of the acid solution (V_acid) added plus any other volumes must sum to 100 cm³. Wait, but the initial solution before adding acid is just the Fe(OH)3 dissolved, but how much volume does that take? Maybe it's negligible, or the problem is considering that the acid is the only solution being added. Alternatively, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in water, making the
