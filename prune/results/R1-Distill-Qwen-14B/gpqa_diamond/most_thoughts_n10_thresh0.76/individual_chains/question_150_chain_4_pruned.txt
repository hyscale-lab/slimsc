Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, okay. The question involves identifying a compound based on NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring, a double bond, etc. Let's think about the possible structures.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR is provided. Let's analyze each peak.

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. Hmm, maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group with two protons.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. This might be aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted because the doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton each. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if it's a doublet of two protons, maybe they're adjacent in a ring. Or maybe it's part of a substituent.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's two protons in a meta or para position. Let me think. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, you might get a doublet if it's a coupling between two equivalent protons. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with substituents.

Another peak at 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Maybe another set of aromatic protons. So perhaps two para-substituted rings? Or maybe one ring with substituents that cause this.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like in an -OH group, but it's a singlet. Wait, but that's 2H. Oh wait, perhaps it's a diol, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like allylic protons or some kind of diene. Hmm.

3.66 ppm, doublet,
