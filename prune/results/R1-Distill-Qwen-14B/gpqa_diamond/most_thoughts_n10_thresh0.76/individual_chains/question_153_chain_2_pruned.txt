Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. Each involves different reactants and conditions, and I need to find the major products.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. Wait, what's a Michael addition again? Oh right, it's a 1,4-addition where a nucleophile (the enolate) attacks a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So, dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it forms the enolate. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Looking at the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the substituent is at the 3-position. So it's more like (p-tolyl) attached to the acrylate. Let me draw it: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3, and the ester on carbon 2 (I think). So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl in place of one of the CH2 groups. Wait, no, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be the third carbon. Hmm, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate's middle carbon? Wait, maybe I should think of it as the alpha-beta unsaturated carbony
