Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside it. The setup is a bit specific, so I need to visualize it. The conductor has a radius R, and there's a small cavity inside. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, imagine a big sphere with a smaller hollow sphere somewhere inside, not exactly at the center because s is the distance between the two centers.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Additionally, the angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, the concept of electrostatic shielding comes into play. Wait, no, wait. I think shielding applies when the conductor is a hollow sphere with charge inside. In that case, the electric field inside the conductor is zero, and outside, it's as if the charge is on the outside. Wait, no, that's when the charge is inside a conductor shell. Oh wait, the conductor itself is neutral, but there's a charge inside the cavity.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged. So, if I have a conductor, and inside it, in the cavity, there's a charge +q. How does the charge distribute on the conductor?

I think that in such a case, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity) will have an induced charge. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the inner surface will have a charge -q, and the outer surface will have +q. Because the conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. So inner surface has -q, outer has +q, totaling zero. 

So for a point outside the conductor, the electric field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Because the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, and by Gauss's law, the field outside a conducting sphere is the same as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the setup is a bit more complicated. The cavity is not at the center of the conductor. The center of the cavity is separated by s from the center of the conductor. Oh, that's an important detail. So the cavity's center is shifted.

So the setup is: a big conductor sphere with radius R, and a smaller cavity inside with radius r, centered at a point s away from the conductor's center. So the cavity is off-center.

Then, a charge +q is placed inside this cavity. How does this affect the electric fields inside and outside?

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. So what's the field there?

I think that the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces will influence the field. Let me think again. If the cavity is off-center, the electric field inside the conductor might not be zero because of asymmetry? Wait, no. Wait, even if the cavity is off-center, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges will redistribute such that the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. Because in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero.

So the conductor's material has no electric field. That means any charges induced on the inner surface (due to the charge inside the cavity) will arrange themselves in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero.

But since the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution will be such that the field inside the conductor cancels any internal fields. So the inner surface will have a charge distribution that's not uniform. It'll probably mirror the position of the charge q relative to the conductor's center.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface will have a charge of +q, because the conductor was neutral. The inner surface must have -q, and the outer +q, so that the net is zero.

Wait, no: the conductor is neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, because the charges in the conductor will rearrange to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the inner surface has -q, and to keep the conductor neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0.

So, the outer surface's charge is +q. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor. But wait, the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R. So regardless of where the cavity's charge is, the outer surface's charge distribution is spherically symmetric because the conductor is a conductor and the charges will redistribute to maintain that symmetry.

Wait, no. If the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution won't be symmetric. But the outer surface's distribution might still be symmetric because it's determined by the field from the inner surface. Hmm, but wait, let me think.

The conductor is neutral, and the inner surface has a charge of -q. So the conductor's material must have a way to arrange these charges so that the field within the conductor is zero. The presence of an off-center charge in the cavity will cause the inner surface to have an asymmetric charge distribution. However, the outer surface would still have a symmetric charge distribution because the field from the inner surface must be such that the conductor's material doesn't have any internal fields. Wait, maybe not. 

Alternatively, perhaps the outer surface will have a charge distribution that's symmetric, as if the net charge were at the center. Because the field outside the conductor would depend only on the total charge on the outer surface, regardless of the distribution inside the conductor.

Wait, the outer surface's charge is +q, so the field outside the conductor would be as if that charge were at the center. Because the conductor's outer surface, being a spherical shell, when carrying a charge, produces an external electric field that depends only on the total charge, not the distribution.

So, point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there would be given by Coulomb's law as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center of the conductor is L, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). 

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is that.

But wait, no. Because the charge is inside a cavity that's off-center. So the distance from the point P to the charge inside the cavity is not exactly the same as the distance to the center of the conductor. Wait, but for the purposes of the external field, the point P is outside the conductor. So the field at P is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q. And the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed (since the conductor is a conductor), so the field outside is as if the charge were at the center.

So regardless of where the charge q is placed inside the cavity (even off-center), the outer surface of the conductor will have a uniform distribution of +q, which will produce an electric field outside as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. 

But wait, the problem states that the charge is placed inside the cavity. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the point P is a distance L from the conductor's center and l from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, so l and s form an angle theta, and the distance from P to the conductor's center is L.

Wait, perhaps the setup is such that the charge is inside the cavity, which is displaced from the center of the conductor. So the induced charge on the inner surface is -q, and on the outer surface +q, as before.

But when calculating the field outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer surface's charge. So the field at any point outside is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but then option B would be the correct answer, because E is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). But let me double-check.

Wait, the point P is outside. The only charge contributing to the field outside is the +q on the outer surface. So by Gauss's law, the flux through a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius L) is q_enc / ε₀, which is q / ε₀. So the electric field at radius L is E * 4πL² = q / ε₀ → E = q/(4π ε₀ L²).

Which would match option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says 1/(4π ε₀) * q/(L²), which is correct.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the charge inside the cavity is displaced, and let's say, for instance, the point P is very close to the displaced charge. Would that affect the external field? No, because the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, so the field outside is spherically symmetric, regardless of where the inner charge is placed.

Yes, that makes sense. Because the conductor's outer surface adjusts to ensure that the charge distribution is uniform, making the external field only depend on the total charge and not on the internal arrangement.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but looking at option D: E = (1/(4 π ε₀)) q/(l²). Hmm, l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. But if the charge were at the cavity's center, then E would be as per option D. But since the conductor's outer surface contributes, it's option B that applies.

Another way to think about it: Imagine the conductor as a shell with charge +q on the outside. The field outside is as if all the charge is at the center of the conductor. So the distance is L, not l. Because l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, which is s away from the conductor's center. So if the charge were at the cavity's center, which is not at the conductor's center, the field would be based on l. But for the conductor's outer charge, it's based on L.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius \( R \) with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is separated by a distance \( s \) from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is \( r \), where \( r < R \). A small positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, which is at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor and \( l \) from the center of the cavity. The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Charge Distribution and Induction**:
   - The conductor is initially neutral. When the charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (facing the cavity) induces a charge of \( -q \) to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material.
   - To maintain neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of \( +q \).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:
   - The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge on its outer surface, not on the distribution of charges inside the conductor or the cavity.
   - Since the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of \( +q \), the electric field at a point outside the conductor (such as \( P \)) is as if the charge \( +q \) were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Electric Field**:
   - The distance from \( P \) to the center of the conductor is \( L \). Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
     \]

4. **Rejection of Other Options**:
   - **Option A**: \( E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2} \) is incorrect because the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the charge on the outer surface, not by the distance to the cavity's center.
   - **Option C**: \( E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2} \) is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: \( E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2} \) is incorrect because \( l \) is the distance from \( P \) to the cavity's center, not the center of the conductor. The field outside depends on the distance to the conductor's center, \( L \).

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point \( P \) is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is \( +q \), and the distance \( L \) from \( P \) to the center of the conductor. The correct expression for the electric field is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This corresponds to **Option B**.
