Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The setup gives some parameters: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, which I think relates to their temperatures. Also, their radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. But wait, how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Hmm, maybe it's a red herring, or maybe it's part of determining something else.

Wait, the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using black body radiation. So I should probably use the Stefan-Boltzmann law here. The formula for luminosity of a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? Where R is radius and T is temperature. Oh, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the problem is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. So I need to find L1 / L2.

But wait, the question gives the mass and radius, but I'm not sure how mass comes into play here. Unless it's a trick, because maybe the mass affects the temperature somehow. Or perhaps it's a red herring, given that the luminosity
