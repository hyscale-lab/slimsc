Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the problem is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead of one third.

Hmm, okay, so let's break this down. I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At ultra-relativistic speeds, v is very close to the speed of light c, so gamma becomes large. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Wait, the key here must be about the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector's walls. Since the particles are moving at a certain speed, their lifetime (as dilated by time dilation) determines how far they can travel before decaying. If the particles' lifetime is such that only a third reach the walls at gamma=20, to get two-thirds, I guess we need a longer lifetime, which would correspond to a higher gamma.

Wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Let's think. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is given by L = c * tau * gamma, where tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame). So, if gamma increases, the decay length increases because gamma is larger.

But in this problem, the particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. So, if a particle's decay length is longer than the radius, it's more likely to decay before reaching the wall. Wait, no, no. Wait, the decay length is the average distance before decay. So if the decay length is exactly equal to the radius, then on average, a particle would reach the wall about half the time. But in this case, with gamma ~20, only one third reach the wall. Hmm, so I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with probabilities. The probability that a particle travels a distance d before decaying is given by the exponential decay function. The probability P that the particle hasn't decayed after
