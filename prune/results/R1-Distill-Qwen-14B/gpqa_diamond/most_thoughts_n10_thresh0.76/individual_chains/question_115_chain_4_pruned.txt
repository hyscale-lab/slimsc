Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, it's about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they typically produce photons. But wait, in this case, it's an electron and a positron colliding.

The setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right.

I need to find the angle between their directions. Let's think about what I know about particle physics and conservation laws here. Oh right, in such collisions, both energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the photons are massless, their energy is entirely due to their momentum (E = pc for photons).

Wait, but since they're moving in opposite directions along the horizontal axis, their momenta might have opposite signs. Also, considering they have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are equal but directions depend on their velocities.

Wait, let me structure this. 

First, I should compute the total energy and momentum of the system before annihilation. Because after annihilation, the photons' energies and directions must match these totals.

So, the system consists of an electron and a positron. Each has their own energy and momentum. Since the electron is moving left to right (positive x-direction), and the positron is moving right to left (negative x-direction), their momenta will have opposite signs.

Wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is left, same as the electron moving left to right. Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify:

Electron is moving from left (so direction is to the right, positive x). Positron is moving from the right, so direction is to the left (negative x). So their velocities are opposite.

Each has a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 4 and 2, respectively. 

Lorentz factor is gamma = total energy (E) / rest mass energy (m*c²). For an electron, rest mass is m_e, same as the positron. So their energies are E_e = gamma_e * m_e c² and E_p = gamma_p * m_e c².

So, E_e = 4 * m_e c² and E_p = 2 * m_e c².

But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum is opposite in sign. Let's compute their momenta.

Momentum p for a relativistic particle is gamma * m_e * v. But direction matters. Since the electron is moving right, its p is positive, and the positron is moving left, so its p is negative.

But wait, wait, no. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x direction. So its momentum is negative.

So, let's compute p_e and p_p.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e
p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p

But since they're moving in opposite directions, v_e is positive, v_p is negative.

Wait, but how do I find their velocities? Well, gamma is given, and gamma =
