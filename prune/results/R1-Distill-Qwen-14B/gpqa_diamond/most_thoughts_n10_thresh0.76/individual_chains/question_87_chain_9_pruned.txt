Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me go through it step by step. 

The question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons total. Hmm, wait, wait. A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so adding two substituents should add more carbons. So if the total is 8, the substituents must add 2 carbons. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituents could be more complicated. Let me think. Each substituent might add one or two carbons. So if it's di-substituted, maybe each substituent is a single carbon. But wait, the total is 8. So the ring has 6, substituents add 2, so each substituent has one carbon each. But wait, that's 6+2=8. Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has zero? No, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a ketone group (-CO-) and the other is a halogen, like chlorine or bromine. Because the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait, what groups are possible? Let's think about di-substituted benzene. One substituent is -X (like Cl or Br), the other is maybe an acyl group, like an acetophenone substituent. Or perhaps a methoxycarbonyl? Hmm, but acetophenone would be a ketone, which is a carbonyl group.

So benzene with two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl), and the other is a carbonyl group, perhaps as an acyl group attached to the ring. Wait, but if it's an acyl group, like R-CO- attached to the ring, that would add more carbons.

Wait,
