Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem says that in the CERN Bubble Chamber, a decay occurs: X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. They're asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I think I can work through it. Let me start by recalling what I know about particle decay and detection.

So, particles moving at relativistic speeds will have their lifetimes dilated due to time dilation in special relativity. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. When the particle is moving relative to the lab frame, the lifetime appears longer because of gamma (γ) factor.

The formula for the observed lifetime τ is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor: γ = E/(m c²). Oh wait, but E here would be the total energy of the particle. Since the particle is moving, its kinetic energy plus rest mass energy gives the total energy. But wait, the problem gives the energy as 27 GeV, so I think that's the total energy E.

Wait, the mass of X⁰ is given as 3.41 GeV. So, the rest energy is m c² = 3.41 GeV. The total energy E is 27 GeV. So, γ would be E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41.

Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, because 3.41 *7 = 23.87. 3.41*8=27.28, which is a bit more than 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. So γ ≈ 7.91.

So the observed lifetime τ is γ * τ₀. Let me compute that. τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s = 63.28e-16 s, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the calculation: 8e-16 multiplied by 7.91. 8 *7.91 is 63.28, so 63.28e-16 s is 6.328e-15 s yes.

Now, the lifetime of the particle as seen in the lab frame is 6.328e-15 seconds. But how does this relate to the detection resolution?

I remember that the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. I think this relates to the particle's velocity and the distance it travels before decaying. Because if the particle's lifetime is longer, it moves further before decaying, so the minimum resolution must be able to detect this distance. If the detector can't resolve it, then we won't see the decay products.

Wait, no, perhaps the resolution is the minimum distance that can be resolved. So, to detect the decay, the particle must travel a certain distance before decaying, which must be within the detector's resolution. Or wait, perhaps it's about the time measurement? No, I think it's spatial resolution.

Wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution (like the smallest distance that the detector can distinguish) needed to observe at least 30% of
