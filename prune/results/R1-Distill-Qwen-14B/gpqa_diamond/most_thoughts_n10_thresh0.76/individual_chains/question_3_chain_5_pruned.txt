Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of a certain operator for a given state. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The particle is a spin-half, so it's like an electron or something similar. The state is given as a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh, right, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. So the state is a superposition of spin-up and spin-down states.

The operator I'm looking at is 10σz +5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. Right, the expectation value is the average outcome if you measured this operator many times on identical systems in this state.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is <ψ| O |ψ>, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So I can split this operator into two parts: the 10σz and the 5σx. So the expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Wait, that makes sense because expectation values are linear. So I can compute each part separately. Let me handle each term step by step.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So the coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. Let's compute the expectation value of σz.

⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1). Because each coefficient squared gives the probability, right? So 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, that's right? Because if the state is more in |↓⟩, the expectation value is negative. Makes sense.

Then, the first part is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second part is 5⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are the |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ states, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So, to compute ⟨σx⟩, I might need to express the state ψ in terms of the σx eigenstates or use another method.

Alternatively, I can compute it directly using the formula. Since σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], the expectation value is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me calculate that. The state
