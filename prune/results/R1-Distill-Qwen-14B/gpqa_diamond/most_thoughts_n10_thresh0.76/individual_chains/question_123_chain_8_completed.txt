Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

A supernova happened in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate and pick the right one.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is probably special relativity because we're dealing with objects moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light and switching between reference frames. I remember that when you have objects moving at high speeds, time dilation and length contraction come into play, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas.

Wait, the question says that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That would mean, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at the same speed, right? Because in classical mechanics, velocities just add, but in relativity, that's not the case. Oh wait, no, because in relativity, if one frame sees the other moving at v, the other sees the first moving at v as well, but the calculation of the distance would involve time and velocity.

Wait, no. Another approach. Let's clarify the frames. The galaxy is at rest in its own frame. The ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in 50 seconds according to the galaxy's frame.

Wait, that sounds straightforward. If the ejecta is moving at v = 6e4 km/s, then in 50 seconds, it would cover v * t. So 6e4 * 50. Let me calculate that. 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Hmm, that's option B. But why is this so simple? Am I missing something about relativity here?

Wait, the problem says that the time passed is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Does that mean we need to calculate the time in the galaxy's frame and then find the distance? Oh wait, because time might dilate. Oh, right, time dilation is when the moving clock (ejecta) runs slower from the galaxy's frame.

So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Let me think. The time experienced in the galaxy would be longer because the ejecta is moving relative to it.

The time dilation formula is t' = gamma * t, where t is the proper time (time in the moving frame, here the ejecta's frame), and t' is the dilated time in the galaxy's frame. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, the question is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame. So the galaxy's frame would see the ejecta moving for a longer time than 50 seconds. So the distance would be v * t', where t' is longer than 50 seconds.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at v, and the ejecta is stationary. But the galaxy's frame would see the ejecta moving for a longer time. So I need to find the time in the galaxy's frame, and then multiply by v to get the distance.

So the steps are:
1. Find the proper time (t) in the ejecta's frame, which is 50 seconds.
2. Compute the time dilation factor, gamma.
3. The time in the galaxy's frame is t' = gamma * t.
4. The distance is v multiplied by t' (since in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving for t' seconds).

Wait, but I think I might have this reversed. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v, but from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta are moving towards us. So maybe I'm getting the direction right.

Let me compute gamma. v is 60,000 km/s. The speed of light, c, is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v/c = 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2. So v is 0.2c, which is 20% the speed of light. That's a moderate speed, so relativistic effects are noticeable but not extreme.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So the time in the galaxy's frame is t' = gamma * t = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * t' = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's very close. Maybe the approximation of gamma is leading to that.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely.

Compute v/c = 0.2.

v²/c² = 0.04.

1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So 1/sqrt(0.96) = 1.020625778.

So gamma is about 1.020625778.

So t' = 50 * 1.020625778 ≈ 51.0312889 seconds.

Then, distance = v * t' = 60,000 km/s * 51.0312889 s = ?

Let me compute 60,000 * 51.0312889.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.0312889 = 60,000 * 1 = 60,000; 60,000 * 0.0312889 ≈ 1,877.334.

So total is 3,000,000 + 60,000 + 1,877.334 ≈ 3,061,877.334 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's the closest, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame, so that would be in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them at v, so the distance is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.

Yes, which is what I did. So 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s is about 3,061,800 km. But the options are in increments of 60,000 or 800, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the frames. Let me think. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, so in their frame, the time is longer. So what's the proper time?

Wait, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. But in this case, the moving of the ejecta is happening, so perhaps the proper time is the time measured in the ejecta's frame. So yes, t is the proper time, and t' is the dilated time.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the length contraction formula. Wait, but in this scenario, the distance between the ejecta and the galaxy is not fixed. Wait, no, because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them, so the distance is length contracted.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The distance between the ejecta (in its own frame) and the galaxy is L0. But from the galaxy's frame, this distance is moving, so it's Lorentz contracted? Hmm, maybe not. Because the galaxy is at rest, and the ejecta is moving towards it. So in the galaxy's frame, the distance is L. In the ejecta's frame, the distance is L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = L / gamma.

But perhaps this isn't necessary. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, and in that time, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's frame, the time is longer.

Wait, but how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame? Because the ejecta is moving, their clocks are running slower. So in the galaxy's frame, more time passes. So for each second in the ejecta's frame, more than a second passes in the galaxy's frame.

So the distance is v multiplied by t', which is the time in the galaxy's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate how much the galaxy moves in the ejecta's frame, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another way: The galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving at v for t' seconds, so the distance is v*t'. The ejecta's frame sees the galaxy moving at v for t seconds, but because of time dilation, t' is longer.

So the calculation is correct as I did before.

So 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

Wait, perhaps the options are rounded. 3,061,800 is approximately 3,060,000 if we're considering significant figures. But 3,060,000 is D, but 3,061,800 is closer to 3,060,000 than to 3,000,000. So D would be the correct answer.

But wait, the options given are: A) 2,940,000 km, B) 3,000,000, C) 2,880,000, D)3,060,000.

Wait, 3,061,800 is 3,061,800, which is 3.0618e6. So 3,060,000 is D, which is 3.06e6, which is the same as 3,060,000. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but wait another thing: perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me compute gamma exactly.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1.020625778.

So t' = 50 * 1.020625778 = 51.0312889 s.

Then distance = 60,000 * 51.0312889 = let's compute that.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.

60,000 * 1.0312889 = 60,000 * 1 = 60,000; 60,000 * 0.0312889 = 60,000 * 0.03 is 1,800; 0.0012889 *60,000=77.334. So total 1,800 +77.334=1,877.334. So 60,000 + 1,877.334=61,877.334.

So 3,000,000 +61,877.334=3,061,877.334 km.

That's approximately 3,061,877 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km, which is the closest. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the question is about the distance from the galaxy's center, so in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves towards it, and the distance is v multiplied by t', which is 60,000 * 51.0312889 ≈3,061,877 km.

But wait, why is the answer not exactly 3,060,000? Perhaps because the exact gamma calculation would give a slightly different value. Wait, is there a calculation error?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.020625778.

So t' =50 * 1.020625778 = 51.0312889 s.

So 60,000 * 51.0312889 = 60,000 * 51.0312889.

Wait, perhaps a more precise multiplication.

51.0312889 * 60,000 = 51.0312889 *6e4.

Compute 51.0312889 *6e4.

51 *6e4=3,060,000.

0.0312889*6e4=1,877.334.

So total is 3,060,000 + 1,877.334 = 3,061,877.334 km.

So 3,061,877 km is approximately 3.061877e6 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. So why is the option not matching precisely? Maybe the problem expects an approximate calculation, and perhaps in the exact calculation, the answer is 3,060,000, but let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the time in the galaxy's frame is 50 seconds multiplied by gamma, but the distance is v multiplied by t, but perhaps I have it wrong.

No, the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So the galaxy sees more time passing, so the distance is greater than 3,000,000 km, which is option B. So among the options, D is the only one higher than 3 million, except for D being 3,060,000.

So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused why the answer isn't exactly 3,060,000 km, but perhaps the options are rounded. Or maybe I should compute the exact gamma.

Wait, let me calculate gamma more precisely.

v =6e4 km/s.

c=3e5 km/s.

v²/c² = (6e4)^2/(3e5)^2 = (36e8)/(9e10) = 4e-2 = 0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10.

sqrt(96) is approximately 9.798 (since 9.798^2=96 approximately). So 9.798/10 is 0.9798.

So gamma is approximately 1.020625778.

So t' =50 * 1.020625778=51.0312889 seconds.

So 60,000 km/s *51.0312889 s= 3,061,877.334 km.

That's very close to 3,060,000 km. Wait, perhaps the question expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02. Let's see:

gamma = 1.020625778 ≈1.0206.

So 1.0206 *50=51.03 seconds.

So 60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km.

Hmm, that's 3,061,800, which is 3,061,800 km, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in approach. Another approach: using the fact that the proper time is in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so in the ejecta's frame, the time is t=50 s, and the distance the galaxy moves is v*t. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy moves 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. But in reality, the galaxy's frame would see less distance due to length contraction.

Wait, no, because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them, so from the galaxy's frame, the distance is longer.

No, perhaps that's complicating things. Let me think in terms of Lorentz transformations. The proper length is the distance in the galaxy's frame, and the ejecta's frame would see it length-contracted.

Wait, no, the proper length (L0) is the length in the frame where the objects are at rest. Wait, in this case, the distance between the ejecta and the galaxy's center is perhaps fixed in the galaxy's frame. So the galaxy's frame has the proper length. So the ejecta's frame would see this length contracted.

But in the problem, I'm to find how much the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame, which is simply v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about this as a simple velocity and time, as the problem might not require considering relativity if the speed isn't extremely high. Wait, 60,000 km/s is 20% of the speed of light. But even so, time dilation is noticeable here.

But perhaps the intended solution is to ignore relativity and just compute v*t, which is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that seems unlikely given the context of the question.

Wait, the problem does not state to ignore relativity, so I think the correct approach is to include time dilation.

So the correct answer should be approximately 3,061,800 km, which is closest to D)3,060,000 km.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame. Since the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, relativistic effects such as time dilation must be considered.

### Key Information:
1. The ejecta is moving at a velocity \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) relative to the Galaxy.
2. The speed of light is \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), so \( v/c = 0.2 \).
3. The time in the ejecta's frame is \( t = 50 \, \text{s} \).
4. The time dilation factor is given by:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206.
   \]
5. The time in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   t' = \gamma \cdot t = 1.0206 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
   \]
6. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t' = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \cdot 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (2,940,000 km):** Too low; does not account for the relativistic time dilation.
- **Option B (3,000,000 km):** The distance if time dilation is ignored, but this is incorrect since relativistic effects must be considered.
- **Option C (2,880,000 km):** Far too low; inconsistent with both classical and relativistic calculations.
- **Option D (3,060,000 km):** Closest to the calculated value of \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \), likely rounded for simplicity.

### Conclusion:
The relativistic calculation gives a distance of approximately \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \), which aligns most closely with **Option D (3,060,000 km)**. This accounts for time dilation and provides the correct relativistic result.

Answer: D
