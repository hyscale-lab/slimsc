Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, each with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines depends on the star's velocity towards or away from us. So, a larger shift means the star is moving faster due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Wait, but how does that relate to the planet's orbital period? I think the RV method gives us the star's velocity, and from that, we can find the planet's mass and orbital period. Oh, right! The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds) )^(1/3) )

But wait, I'm probably mixing up the exact formula. Maybe there's a simpler way. Since both stars are similar to the Sun, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), perhaps the formula can be approximated.

I think the RV method relates the semi-amplitude K (which is the velocity of the star) to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I'm recalling is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/1) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds) )^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh right! The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π) ) ]^(-1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]

But for circular orbits, e=0, so that term becomes 1. Also, if the star's mass M_* is much larger than the planet's mass M_p, which it is (Sun-like stars vs Neptune), then M_* + M_p ~ M_*, so we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So, simplifying, K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_*^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) * (1 / (P ) )^(1/3) ) * [something with 2π and days to seconds? Maybe I'm mixing up the units here.]

Wait, perhaps the formula is more accurately expressed as:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*^(2/3)) * ( (P * (1 day in seconds) )^(1/3) ) )

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because K is velocity, which is distance over time. So perhaps K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) / (P)^(1/3). But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, another approach: since both stars are identical (same mass, same planet masses), perhaps the ratio of their velocities can be related to the ratio of
