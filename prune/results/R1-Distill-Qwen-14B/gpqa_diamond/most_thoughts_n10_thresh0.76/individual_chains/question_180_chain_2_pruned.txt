Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. Hmm.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th is fixed at P. And we need to find the minimum energy of this system. The options are given, so I guess I need to calculate it.

Wait, energy in an electrostatic system. Oh right, I remember that the potential energy between point charges can be calculated. But wait, isn't the potential energy for a system of point charges the sum of the potential energies of each pair? Yeah, because each pair contributes to the total potential energy.

So the formula is U = k * sum (q_i * q_j / r_ij) for each pair. But wait, since the system is isolated, we need to calculate the total potential energy between all the charges.

But wait, here we have 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? They are all at the same point, 2 meters from P, but are they fixed in space? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So I think they form a
