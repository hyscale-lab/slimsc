Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The speed of light is c. The options are given as A to D.

Alright, I remember that in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so things are a bit different. In relativity, energy and momentum are handled differently because of the gamma factor.

Let me think about the energy in this system. In the relativistic case, the total energy of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, no, actually, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but in relativity, maybe it's different. Or is it still the same?

Wait, so the oscillator is obeying F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. So the potential energy is U = (1/2)kx², same as classical. But the kinetic energy in relativity isn't (1/2)mv², it's (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy E of the oscillator at any point is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. So E = K + U = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

Wait, but at maximum speed, the displacement x is zero because the oscillator is moving fastest when passing through equilibrium. No, wait, actually, maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic, because potential energy is zero at x=0. So that's the point of maximum speed. But in this case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at the extremes. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is (1/2)kA², right? Because at maximum displacement x=A, all energy is potential. As the mass moves towards equilibrium
