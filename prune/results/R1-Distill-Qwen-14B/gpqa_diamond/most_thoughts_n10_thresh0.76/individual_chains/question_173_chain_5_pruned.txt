Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about uncertainty in an electron's energy. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has to do with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Let me think about what I know.

The question says the electron is traveling along the x-direction at a speed v of 2 * 10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. Oh right, the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But for the minimum uncertainty, I think we can take Δx * Δp = ħ/2. Oh wait, no, actually, the product is at least ħ/2, but for the minimum, maybe we take it as ħ/2. Or perhaps it's more accurate to write it as Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx), but I'm not sure about the exact factor.

So, if I can find Δp (the uncertainty in momentum), then I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy. Because energy is related to momentum. Since the electron is moving with speed v, its momentum p is m*v, where m is the mass of the electron.

Wait, but since there's an uncertainty in momentum, Δp, that would relate to the uncertainty in energy. Because E is the kinetic energy, which is (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in energy
