Okay, so I’ve got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because Diels-Alder reactions can be tricky, but let's take it step by step. The question is about reacting 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene with maleic anhydride. I need to find the major product from the given options.

First, I remember that the Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. The diene has to be conjugated and in the s-cis conformation to react effectively. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile, so that's settled.

Let me think about the structure of 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, a cyclopentadiene would have two double bonds if it's 1,3-diene? No, wait, wait. No, a cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, but that's not possible in a five-membered ring without being conjugated. Wait, no, wait—wait, no. Wait, a cyclopentadiene would have a single double bond, but 1,3-diene implies two double bonds? No, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is cyclopenta-1,3-diene. That means the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4, right? So the molecule is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, but that's impossible because that would be an allene, but in a ring? Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated diene. Wait, wait, wait, wait—no, perhaps I'm misremembering. Wait, cyclopentadiene is usually 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is a conjugated diene. So, it's a five-membered ring with two double bonds in a conjugated system. But wait, in reality, cyclopentadiene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is a conjugated diene. So,
