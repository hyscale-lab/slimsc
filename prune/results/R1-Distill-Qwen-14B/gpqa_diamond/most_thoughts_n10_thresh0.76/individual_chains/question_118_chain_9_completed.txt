Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

First, I need to remember what cyclopent-1-enol looks like. Cyclopentenol is a five-membered ring with an -OH group and a double bond. Since it's 1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, right? So the structure would have the OH on C1 or C2? Wait, wait. Wait, enol is an alcohol with a conjugated double bond. So the structure is like a cyclopentane ring where one of the adjacent carbons has an OH group, and there's a double bond next to it.

So 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol would have substituents on the ring. The numbering is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH group is on C2. Because in enols, the OH is on the carbon adjacent to the double bond. Wait, no: wait, enol is where the OH is on a carbon next to a double bond. So for cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2 or C1? Hmm, I think the numbering is such that the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the OH is on carbon 2. Because the name is cyclopent-1-enol. So the positions are 1 (double bond starts here), and the OH is on 2.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the enol structure can be either the alpha or beta form. But in this case, the name is cyclopent-1-enol, so the double bond starts at C1. So the structure is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an -OH group on C2. So the OH is on the same carbon as the double bond's end.

So the structure is something like:

      HO
      |
C1=C2 - C3
with the substituents. But wait, the molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the substituents on C4. So the ring would have methyl groups on C4, two of them.

So, the ring has five carbons. Let me try to imagine it. Numbering the ring: starting at C1 (double bond), then C2 (OH), C3, C4 (with two methyl groups), and C5.

Now, the reaction is with bromine. Bromine in what form? Probably Br2. So Br2 is a dienophile? Or maybe it's adding across double bonds.

Wait, wait. The starting material is an enol, which has a conjugated double bond. Adding bromine to a double bond typically leads to dibromide addition. But wait, enols might undergo different reactions because of the presence of the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition? Or perhaps it's an electrophilic addition.

Wait, another thought: enols can undergo bromination in different positions. For example, in the presence of certain conditions, the enol can react via a conjugate addition (like in Michael addition), but I'm not sure if that's what's happening here.

But bromine (Br2) is a dihalogen. When it reacts with alkenes, it adds across the double bond in a dibromide. For a cyclopentene, adding Br2 would result in a vicinal dibromide, right? So if the starting material is cyclopent-1-ene, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromocyclopentane.

But wait, in this case, the starting material is an enol, which is a conjugated dienol? Or is it a simple alkene with an adjacent hydroxyl group?

Wait, the structure is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the enol is adjacent to the double bond. So the molecule is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH on C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

So when Br2 is added, it would add across the double bond. But wait, how does the enol affect this?

Wait, another possibility: the enol might undergo some reaction besides the double bond addition. For example, maybe the OH could participate in some way. Or perhaps the enol is more reactive than a regular alkene because of the conjugation with the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an electrophilic addition. The enol has an electron-rich double bond, so Br2 could add across it.

But wait, another thought: if the enol is in a conjugated system, perhaps the Br adds in a conjugate fashion. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the enol could tautomerize. Wait, no, because the question is about the reaction as is.

Wait, another angle: when an enol reacts with bromine, what's the major product? I remember that enols can undergo bromination in different positions. But wait, maybe it's a dihydroxylation? No, that's with other reagents like OsO4 or H2O2 in acidic conditions.

Wait, no, Br2 usually adds across double bonds. So the major product would be a dibromide. So the dienol (if it's conjugated) would add Br2 across the double bond.

Wait, but wait, the enol is an allylic alcohol. So when Br2 adds to the double bond, perhaps it forms a bromohydrin? Or is that with other reagents like SOBr2 or HBr?

No, wait, the bromohydrin is when you have an addition of Br and OH across the double bond, but that usually happens with a peracid or other reagents. But in this case, maybe the enol's OH is involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide, and the hydroxyl group remains.

So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Looking at the options, options A and D are 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. The difference is in the stereochemistry: A is (1R,2S), D is (1R,2R).

So the question is about the major product's stereochemistry.

Wait, but the starting enol has a specific structure. Let me think: the enol is in a specific conformation. When Br2 adds to the double bond, the addition is typically anti and follows the bromonium ring opening mechanism, leading to possible stereoisomerism.

Wait, but in a cyclopentene, adding Br2 would form a bromonium ion intermediate, and then opening would lead to anti addition.

So in the starting material, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 is a methyl group? Wait no, the substituents are on C4: 4,4-dimethyl.

Wait, the structure is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the substituents (two methyl groups) are on C4.

So when Br2 adds, it's across C1 and C2. The addition would be anti, so the Brs would be on opposite sides.

But wait, the enol has an OH on C2. So when Br2 adds, the OH is on C2 and the Brs are on C1 and C2 (or C2 and C3? Wait, no: the double bond is C1-C2. Adding Br2 would add Br to C1 and C2, making 1,2-dibromo.

So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Now, the question is about the stereochemistry. The starting material is an enol, which is a planar structure. So the approach of Br2 could lead to either retention or inversion, but in the case of bromonium ion ring opening, the addition is trans (anti).

Wait, but wait: the enol is in a chair-like transition state? Or is it more about the ring's structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enol is in a certain configuration, and the Br adds in a certain way.

Wait, but the starting enol is probably not a stereogenic center. Wait, in cyclopent-1-enol, the OH is on C2. So the structure is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2.

When adding Br2, the approach of Br2 would form the bromonium ion, and then the ring opens with the bromide ions attacking from the opposite side.

So the addition would be trans. So the Brs would end up on opposite faces.

But wait, the hydroxyl group is on C2. So in the starting material, the OH is on C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So when Br adds to C1 and C2, the hydroxyl group is on C2. So when the Brs add, the configuration would be such that the Br on C1 is on the opposite side of the OH on C2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw this mentally. Imagine the cyclopentene ring with the double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2. When adding Br2, the Brs add to C1 and C2, anti to each other.

So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, with the OH on C2.

Now, the question is about the stereochemistry of the Brs. So the OH is on C2, and the Brs are on C1 and C2. So the diastereomers would depend on how the Brs are arranged.

Wait, but in the product, C2 has two substituents: the OH and a Br. So C2 would be a stereogenic center if it has four different groups. Let's see: the groups attached to C2 are: the cyclopentane ring (as part of the ring), OH, Br, and another carbon (C1 and C3).

Wait, no, in the product, it's 1,2-dibromo. So C1 has a Br, and C2 has a Br and OH.

Wait, but the ring is cyclopentane, so each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons. So C1 is connected to C5 and C2; C2 is connected to C1, C3, and has a Br and OH.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure more clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a simple addition. Let me think: another possibility is that the enol could undergo a conjugate addition, but Br2 is more likely to do a simple diaddition.

Wait, but let's think about the product options. The options are:

A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

So options B and C have a ketone (cyclopentanone) instead of an enol. So they're suggesting a ketone is formed, with a single Br. Hmm.

So what's more plausible: addition across the double bond (options A, D) or a substitution reaction leading to a ketone?

Wait, another possibility: the enol could tautomerize to the keto form under certain conditions. But bromine is a dienophile, but wait, in the presence of Br2, perhaps the enol would undergo some kind of substitution.

Wait, but I think the most straightforward reaction is adding Br2 across the double bond. So the major product would have two Brs added.

But let's think about the options. If the diaddition happens, the product would be a vicinal dibromide with the OH group. So options A and D.

The difference is the configuration: (1R,2S) vs (1R,2R).

So the question is about the stereochemistry of the addition.

In the bromonium ion mechanism, the bromine adds in a way that leads to anti addition. So the two Brs are added on opposite sides of the ring.

But wait, in the starting enol, the OH is on C2. So when adding Br2, which is a dihalogen, the approach would be such that the Brs add across the double bond in a trans fashion.

So let's imagine the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the OH on C2. Adding Br2 would form Br-C1 and Br-C2, with the Brs on opposite sides.

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, the addition is a bit tricky. Let me consider the chair-like transition state. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is too strained for a chair, so it's more of a boat or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the transition state. The bromine attacks from the same face, leading to the bromonium ion, and then the second Br- attacks from the opposite face.

Wait, but in a cyclic system, the addition would lead to the Brs being on adjacent carbons, but opposite faces.

So in the product, the Br on C1 would be on one face, and the Br on C2 on the opposite face, considering the ring's structure.

But the OH is on C2. So the stereochemistry would depend on where the OH is in relation.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH is in a position that affects the addition.

Wait, maybe the enol's OH group is in a position that makes the addition of Br2 either on the same face (syn) or opposite face (anti).

Wait, but Br2 adds in a trans (anti) fashion, regardless of substituents.

So, the diastereomer formed would depend on the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, but the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the substituents are on C4, which is two positions away from the double bond.

So, the ring's substituents (two methyl groups) are on C4, which is across from C2.

So when Br2 adds to C1 and C2, which are adjacent, the resulting stereocenters would be C1 and C2.

Now, considering the approach of Br2, the Brs would add anti to each other. So the Br on C1 would be on the opposite side of the Br on C2.

But how does this relate to the existing OH group?

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure. Let's say the ring is drawn with C1 at the top, C2 next, then C3, C4 (with two methyl groups), and C5.

The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2.

In the starting enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the OH on C2. The substituents are on C4, which is opposite to C2 in the ring.

So when Br2 adds, the Brs add across the double bond, leading to the Brs being on opposite sides.

So, the Br on C1 is on one side, and the Br on C2 is on the opposite side. But the OH is on C2, which is in a certain position.

Wait, perhaps I can assign R/S configurations.

Assuming the Brs are anti, let's say the Br on C1 is on the same face as the ring's C5 (let's say that's the top), and the Br on C2 is on the opposite face (the bottom). But the OH is on C2, so its position will affect the configuration.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign the configurations.

Let me imagine the product: 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

C1 has a Br and is connected to C5 and C2.

C2 has a Br, an OH, and is connected to C1 and C3.

So, for C1: substituents are Br, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and a CH2 connected to C2.

Wait, but in reality, the cyclopentane ring is a five-membered ring, so each C is connected to two adjacent Cs and two substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Newman projection or a specific model.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a trans arrangement of the Brs. So if the Br on C1 is R, the Br on C2 would be S, or vice versa.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the diaddition could result in the same configuration on both C1 and C2, leading to a diepimer.

Another approach: in the addition of Br2 to a double bond, the bromine adds across the double bond in a trans (anti) fashion. So the Brs are on opposite faces.

So, in the product, the Brs are on opposite sides of the ring.

Now, considering the starting enol: the OH is on C2, so its position is fixed. So when Br adds to C2, it's on the opposite face of the OH.

Wait, that would mean that the Br on C2 is on the opposite face of the OH, which is on C2.

So, the Br and OH are on opposite faces of the ring.

But for the configuration (R/S), the arrangement of substituents around each carbon is important.

Let me consider C1 and C2 in the product.

For C1:

- The substituents are:

   a) Br

   b) C5 (which is a CH2 group connected to C4)

   c) C2 (which is a carbon attached to Br, OH, and C3)

   d) Another CH2 group (from the ring, connected to C5)

Wait, perhaps more accurately, each carbon in a cyclopentane ring is connected to two adjacent carbons, and two substituents.

So for C1:

- Two adjacent carbons: C5 and C2.

- Two substituents: Br and another CH2 group (but wait, in the ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent, so maybe C1 is connected to C5 and C2, and the substituents are Br and a methyl group? No, the substituents are on C4, which is C4.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to sketch it mentally.

The ring is cyclopentane:

C1 is connected to C5 and C2.

C2 is connected to C1, C3, and has the OH and Br.

C3 is connected to C2 and C4.

C4 is connected to C3 and C5, and has two methyl groups.

C5 is connected to C4 and C1.

So, for C1, substituents are Br, and the two ring bonds to C5 and C2.

Wait, but in terms of the substituents, each C has four bonds. So for C1, the bonds are:

- C5 (CH2)

- C2 (CH)

- Br

- Another CH2 (to C5?)

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, each ring carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and two substituents.

So for C1:

- connected to C5 and C2 (ring bonds)

- substituents: Br and another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen or another methyl?

Wait, no, the substituents are on C4. So C1 has Br and a hydrogen? No, because the starting material is 4,4-dimethyl, so the only substituents are on C4.

Wait, perhaps C1 has Br and a hydrogen, but that's unlikely because the only substituents are on C4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to imagine the structure again. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol.

So the ring is cyclopentane, with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH on C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

So, substituents:

- C1: connected to C5 and C2, no substituents (just H and the double bond)

Wait, no, the substituents are on C4, so C1 would have only the double bond and ring connections.

Wait, perhaps the structure is as follows:

- C1: connected to C5 and C2 via double bond (C1=C2)

- C2: connected to C1, C3, and has the OH group.

- C3: connected to C2 and C4.

- C4: connected to C3, C5, and has two methyl groups.

- C5: connected to C4 and C1.

So, in the enol structure, the double bond is C1-C2. C2 has the OH.

So when Br2 adds, it adds across C1 and C2, making C1 and C2 each have Br.

So product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Now, the configuration at C1 and C2:

The addition of Br2 is trans, so the Brs are on opposite sides.

But the OH is on C2, so its configuration would influence the Br's position.

Wait, perhaps C2's substituents are OH, Br, C1, and C3.

So, for C2, the substituents are:

- OH (maybe axial or equatorial)

- Br (added across the double bond, so in a trans position)

- C1 (connected via a single bond, perhaps)

- C3.

To determine R/S configuration, we have to assign priorities.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the product.

The options A and D are 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol with different configurations.

Option A is (1R,2S), and D is (1R,2R).

Which is correct?

Well, when Br2 adds across a double bond in a trans fashion, the Brs are on opposite sides.

In the starting enol, the OH is on C2, so when Br adds to C2, it's on the opposite side of the OH.

So, the Br on C2 is anti to the OH.

So, if the OH is on the top face, the Br on C2 is on the bottom face.

Similarly, the Br on C1 is added from the opposite face, so if the addition is trans, the Br on C1 is on the same face as the Br on C2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no: the addition is anti, so Br on C1 and C2 are on opposite faces.

Wait, maybe I should think about the transition state.

When Br2 adds to a double bond, the bromine atoms add from opposite sides, leading to a trans addition.

So, the Br on C1 is added from one face, and the Br on C2 is added from the opposite face.

In the starting material, the OH is on C2, so the face where the Br adds to C2 is opposite to the OH.

So, in the product, the Br on C2 is on the opposite face of the OH.

So, if the OH is on the top face, the Br on C2 is on the bottom face.

Similarly, the Br on C1 is added from the top face (since the Br on C2 is from the bottom face, because they are anti).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs being on the same face, but I'm pretty sure it's anti.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the cyclopentane ring and the positions.

Imagine the double bond between C1 and C2 is in a certain conformation. When Br2 adds, the Brs will be trans to each other.

So, if the OH is on C2 in a certain position, the Br on C2 will be on the opposite side.

So, the Br on C1 will be on the same side as the Br on C2 is anti to the OH.

Hmm. It's a bit confusing. But perhaps the key point is that the diaddition leads to a vicinal dibromide with the OH still present.

Looking at the options, the correct product would be either A or D, depending on the configuration.

But the question doesn't give any configuration, only the structure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the addition of Br2 to the enol leads to the formation of a bromohydrin, but I think that's when the reagent is something like HBr with peroxide, leading to allylic bromination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a halogenation via an enol mechanism, leading to bromide at the alpha position.

Wait, but the starting material is an enol, so maybe it's more reactive towards electrophilic attack at the alpha position.

Wait, another possibility is that the enol reacts with bromine in an electrophilic substitution. But cyclopentane isn't aromatic, so substitution isn't likely.

Wait, perhaps the enol's alpha position is where bromine adds. The alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl (if it's a ketone), but in this case, it's an enol.

Wait, the enol has a conjugated system, so the alpha position is the same as the double bond's position.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about what each option represents.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

So, this would imply that the enol has been oxidized to a ketone, and bromine has added to the alpha carbon.

But I don't think Br2 would oxidize an enol to a ketone. That's more like an oxidation with something like KMnO4 or another oxidizing agent.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

This would suggest that the bromine is added to the same carbon as the methyl groups, but that's C4, which is not the alpha position.

Wait, but the starting material is an enol, so perhaps, under certain conditions, the enol could dehydrate and form a ketone, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, but I don't think Br2 does that.

So, perhaps the initial thought was correct: the major product is a vicinal dibromide with the OH still present.

So, the options A and D are possible.

Now, the stereochemistry.

In the bromonium ion formation, the bromine adds from the same face, leading to a bromonium ring, and then the ring opens with Br- attack from the opposite side.

So, the Brs are added on opposite sides.

So, for the product, the Br on C1 is on one face, and the Br on C2 is on the opposite face.

Now, considering the OH on C2, which is in a certain position.

Assuming the OH is on the top face, then the Br on C2 is on the bottom face (since it's anti).

The Br on C1 would be on the top face (since in the addition, the Brs are on opposite faces).

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think again.

In the bromonium ion, the Br adds to one face, creating a three-membered ring. Then, the second Br- attacks from the opposite face, leading to the opening of the ring.

So, the two Brs are on opposite faces.

In the product, the Br on C1 and C2 are on opposite faces.

So, for C1, Br is on one face (say, top), and for C2, Br is on the opposite face (bottom). But the OH is on C2 on the top face.

So, for C2, substituents are OH (top), Br (bottom), C1 (left), and C3 (right).

So, when assigning the configuration for C2, the substituents are OH, Br, C1, and C3.

The priorities would be: OH (highest), Br (next), then C1 and C3 (same as each other).

So, for C2, arranging the substituents in priority order: OH (1), Br (2), C1 (3), C3 (4).

The configuration is determined by the order of these substituents when looking at the highest priority substituents.

If the OH is in a certain position, and the Br is on the opposite face, then the configuration would be either R or S.

But without a clear model, it's a bit hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't present that. They present specific configurations.

Wait, but the starting material is (4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol). Is the starting material chiral? The enol has an OH on C2. So, if C2 has four different substituents, it would be a stereocenter.

But in the enol, the substituents on C2 are:

- OH

- C1 (double bond)

- C3

- and another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen or another group.

Wait, in the enol, the C2 is double-bonded to C1, so it's a vinylic position, not a chiral center. Because in a double bond, the substituents are on either side, but the sp² hybridized C can't be a chiral center.

So, the starting material isn't chiral. So, when Br2 adds, the product will have two stereocenters at C1 and C2, but they could be either both R, both S, or one R and one S.

But how does the addition of Br2 affect the configuration?

In the bromonium ion mechanism, the attack of the second Br- can occur from either side, but in a ring structure, it's constrained.

Wait, but in a cyclic structure, the ring's geometry might influence the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a specific configuration because of the ring's structure.

Wait, perhaps in a five-membered ring like cyclopentane, the addition of Br2 leads to a trans-dibromide, where the Brs are on opposite faces.

So, for C1 and C2, the Brs are on opposite faces.

Now, considering the OH on C2, which is in a certain position, the Br on C2 would be on the opposite face.

So, the Br on C1 is on the same face as the OH on C2.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think in terms of a ring.

Imagine the ring as a flat structure. C1 is at the top, connected to C2 (right) and C5 (left). C2 is connected to C3 (down). The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2.

When adding Br2, the Brs add across the double bond, with Br on C1 and C2.

The approach of Br2 would be from the same face (maybe from above), leading to the Br on C1 being added from above, and the Br on C2 from below, or vice versa.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is a meso compound, but the options don't show that.

Looking back, the options are A and D.

Option A: (1R,2S)

Option D: (1R,2R)

Which is more likely?

In a trans addition, if the Br on C1 is R, the Br on C2 would be S if they're on opposite faces.

Wait, let's model it.

Assume C1 has the Br in a certain position, and C2 has the Br in another.

If the Br on C1 is on the top face, and the Br on C2 is on the bottom face, then for C1:

The substituents are Br (top), two CH2 groups (left and right), and C2 (down).

Assigning priorities: Br (1), then the two CH2 groups (same priority), and C2 (4).

Wait, when looking at C1, the substituents are:

1. Br (highest)

2. C5 (CH2)

3. C2 (CH)

4. C? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the priorities are based on the substituents attached.

For C1, substituents would be:

- Br (priority 1)

- C5 (CH2- group, attached to C4 (two methyls)), so perhaps a branch.

- C2 (CH, attached to OH, Br, etc.)

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to think that the product's configuration depends on the approach of Br2.

But I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should consider the answer based on the options.

The options for the dibromide are A and D.

Since the starting material is not chiral, the product could form a racemic mixture, but the options don't present that. So perhaps the product is a specific diastereomer.

Alternatively, the addition leads to both Brs being on the same face, making the product (1R,2R) or (1S,2S). But I thought it's trans addition.

Wait, no, the addition is trans, so the Brs are on opposite faces.

Which would make the configurations opposite, like (1R,2S) or (1S,2R).

So, looking at the options, A is (1R,2S), which fits this scenario.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br₂). The starting material is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH group on C2, and two methyl groups on C4. Bromine typically reacts with alkenes via electrophilic addition, forming a bromonium ion intermediate, which is then attacked by a bromide ion to yield a vicinal dibromide product. This addition occurs in a trans (anti) fashion.

In this case, Br₂ adds across the double bond between C1 and C2, resulting in a 1,2-dibromo product. The -OH group on C2 remains unaffected during the reaction. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the anti addition mechanism, where the bromine atoms are added to opposite faces of the ring. 

The product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. The stereochemistry at C1 and C2 is determined by the positions of the bromine atoms relative to the -OH group on C2. Based on the anti addition mechanism, the bromine on C1 and C2 are on opposite faces of the ring. This results in the (1R,2S) configuration, as the -OH group on C2 influences the stereochemical outcome.

Among the given options, the correct product is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.
