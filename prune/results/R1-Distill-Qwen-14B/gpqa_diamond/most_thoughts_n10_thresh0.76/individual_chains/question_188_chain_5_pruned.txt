Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the structure of the crystal. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal with specific angles and interatomic distance. Let me think through this step by step.

First, a rhombohedral crystal has all edges equal and all angles equal too. So, in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait, interatomic distance—does that mean the lattice parameter a is 10? Because in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√1, but wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter a might be related differently to the interatomic distance. Or maybe the interatomic distance is the edge length a? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure is the same as the lattice parameter a. Because in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a, right? So maybe here the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstrom.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, the interplanar distance d_hkl is calculated using the formula derived from the crystal structure. The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * (1/(1 - cos²α)) or something like that. Wait, no, that's not right.
