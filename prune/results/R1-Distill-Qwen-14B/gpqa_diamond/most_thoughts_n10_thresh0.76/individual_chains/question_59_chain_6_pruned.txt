Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says. It's a mixture of three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. And I need to pick the pH from the given options. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions. Since there are both acids and a base here, I think the first thing to do is figure out how much acid and base there is in terms of moles and see if they neutralize each other out or if there's an excess.

So, let's calculate the moles for each solution.

Starting with CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. The formula for moles is Molarity × Volume (in liters). So for CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

Next, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. So moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one mole of H+ ions.

Now Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Its formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^- when it dissociates. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions. The moles here are 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since each gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, so I have a total of H+ from CH3COOH and HCl, and OH- from Ba(OH)2. But I think the strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other first, right? Because they completely dissociate.

So, let's find the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate, but HCl does. Wait, but when mixed with a strong base, maybe the strong acid will react first.

Wait, perhaps I should think of all the H+ and OH- in the mixture, considering neutralization.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total H+ would be the H+ from HCl plus the H+ from CH3COOH (though only partially ionized). But when you mix with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, the OH- will react with H+ from the acids.

So perhaps I should calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Let me calculate the equivalents:

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

H+ from CH3COOH: since it's weak, the H+ is not entirely from it. But in solution, it's going to contribute some H+. But if I have excess OH-, maybe I can first calculate the neutralization between H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the total H+ and OH- in the solution and see if they neutralize each other. If the equivalents of H+ are greater than OH-, the solution will be acidic. If OH- are in excess, then basic. If they're equal, neutral.

Wait, but for H3COOH, the H+ is not all available. Hmm. Oh, but when you mix all the solutions together, the strong acid (HCl) will provide a lot of H+ which will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. The acetic acid, being a weak acid, won't contribute as much H+ initially, but once the strong acid and base have reacted, I can consider what's left.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Calculate all the moles of H+ from strong acids (HCl and Ba(OH)2's OH-).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, HCl is H+ and Cl-; Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ and OH-.

So first, the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH; OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

The strong acid HCl will react with the strong base Ba(OH)2. Let's see:

HCl is H+ (0.08 moles) and Ba(OH)2 gives OH- (0.18 moles). So when H+ and OH- meet, they form water. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the moles of H+ from HCl is 0.
