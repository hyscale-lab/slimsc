Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the probability that a measurement of a certain observable P will yield 0. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I think that's the state vector ψ. 

The observable P is represented by a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So P looks like this:

[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]

Wait, what's the structure of P? It seems like it's a symmetric matrix, which makes sense because observables are typically Hermitian. So P is a Hermitian matrix, which is good because that ensures real eigenvalues.

The question is about finding the probability of measuring 0 when we measure P. That means I need to find the eigenvector(s) of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the probability of the state ψ collapsing into that eigenvector.

Alternatively, maybe I can express ψ in terms of the eigenvectors of P and find the coefficient corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The square of the absolute value of that coefficient would give the probability.

But wait, let me think about the steps involved.

First, I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when you measure an observable, you get one of its eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

So, the plan is:

1. Find the eigenvalues of P.
2. For each eigenvalue, find the corresponding eigenvector.
3. Express the state vector ψ as a linear combination of these eigenvectors.
4. The coefficient for the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue 0 will give the probability when squared.

So let's start with finding the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

The matrix P - λ
