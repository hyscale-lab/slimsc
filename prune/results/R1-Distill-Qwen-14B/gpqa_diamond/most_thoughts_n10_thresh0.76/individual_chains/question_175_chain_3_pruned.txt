Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they can radiate energy, and this has to do with electromagnetic waves. Let me think step by step.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around that axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis.

The maximum power is A. They want the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of f.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the radiation patterns. I remember that for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern isn't isotropic. It's maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole. Oh wait, but in this case, the charge distribution is along the z-axis, so the dipole would be aligned along z. So the radiation would be strongest in the equatorial plane, which is the plane perpendicular to z, meaning θ=90 degrees would be the maximum.

But wait, the question is about the maximum power A, and what fraction is radiated at θ=30 degrees.

Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power would be the integral of f over all solid angles. But the maximum value of f would correspond to the maximum direction.

Wait, for a dipole radiation, the radiation pattern is given by the formula for the intensity, which is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees, which is the equator.

So if the function f(θ) is proportional to sin²θ, then the maximum of f is at θ=90, which is the maximum direction.

But wait, the maximum power A would be the maximum value of f(θ), I think. Because for each direction, f gives the power per unit solid angle. So the total power is the integral of f over 4π steradians. But the maximum power A is the maximum value of the function f, not the total power.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the maximum value of f would be the maximum power per unit solid angle, while the total power is the integral of f
