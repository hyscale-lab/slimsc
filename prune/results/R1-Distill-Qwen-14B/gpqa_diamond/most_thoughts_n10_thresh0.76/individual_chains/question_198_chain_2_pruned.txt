Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. So the setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M (10^-2 M), and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, maybe with two SCN- ions.

Wait, wait. The blue complexes... I remember that Co(II) can form various colored complexes. The blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ ion. I think the dithiocyanato complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or something. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure. But the key thing is to find the percentage of that specific species among all cobalt species.

Stability constants come into play here. The β (beta) values are the formation constants for each complex. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on. The formation constant (β) for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is given by βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n^(2-n)] ] / ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ). So each βn represents how much the nth complex is formed.

But wait, how do these β values relate to each other? I think the complexes are formed stepwise. So each β corresponds to adding another SCN- ion. So β1 is the constant for forming [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Wait, but the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which would be the n=2 case. So the β2 is 40. But wait, the question gives
