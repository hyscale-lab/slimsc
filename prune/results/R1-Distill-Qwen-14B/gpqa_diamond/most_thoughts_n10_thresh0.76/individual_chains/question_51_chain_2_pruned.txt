Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me see. The question is about a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with potentials and energies around conductors, image charges might come into play. Oh right, the method of images is used for problems involving conductors. But wait, the sphere is grounded. So, that probably means the sphere is at zero potential, and any charges induced on it would be such that the potential at infinity is zero.

So, the setup is: a point charge q is outside a conducting sphere. Because the sphere is conducting and grounded, the charges will redistribute on its surface. The sphere's potential remains zero, so the induced charges will create an image charge configuration that effectively cancels the potential on the sphere.

The method of images says that for a conducting sphere, the image charge of a point charge q placed at a distance d from the center would be a charge -q' located somewhere. Wait, no, the image charge's position depends on the sphere's radius. Let me think. The image charge q' is placed inside the sphere, so that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, for a sphere of radius R, the image charge q' would be located at a distance (R²/d) from the center, but on the opposite side of the charge q. So, if the charge q is at a distance d from the center, the image charge would be at a distance R²/d from the center, but in the opposite direction. So the total distance between q and the image charge would be d + (R²/d) = (d² + R²)/d.

Wait, but the image charge isn't the same as the original charge. If the sphere is a conductor, the image charge is determined by the condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. For a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the image charge q' has a magnitude of (R^3/(d^2 - R^2)) * q, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the potential energy of the system can be considered as the work done in assembling the charges. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential at infinity is zero. The system's potential energy arises due to the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But wait, the sphere is neutral overall because it's grounded. So, when the charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges consist of +q' and -q', but the net charge remains zero because it's grounded. I think the induced positive charge is on the near side, and negative on the far side, but the total charge of the sphere remains zero.

Wait, no. The sphere is initially neutral. When a positive charge q is placed near it, the sphere's near side gets induced negative charges (because the field from q attracts positive charges away, leaving negative on the near side). But since the sphere is conducting, the induced charges will be on the surface. Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so any induced charges can leave or enter the ground, keeping the net charge zero. So the sphere's total charge remains zero, but there are surface charges induced as +q' and -q' such that the total is zero. But how does that work
