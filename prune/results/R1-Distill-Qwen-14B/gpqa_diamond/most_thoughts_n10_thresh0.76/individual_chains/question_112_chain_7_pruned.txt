Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Here, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, they're the standard basis states for spin-½ systems. The first part of the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation has elements A_ij. The operator A is such that A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, so that matrix for A must be a 2x2 matrix because the state is two-dimensional. Let me write that out. The operator A has elements where the diagonal elements are zero (since if i=j, A_ij=0), and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that this kind of matrix corresponds to an operator that's proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix has 1s on the off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal. So A = (ħ/2) * X.

Now, the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A. Wait, each eigenstate? So, I think the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of the Pauli X matrix, because A is a scalar multiple of X. The eigenstates of X are the eigenstates for the spin in the x-direction. They're (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

But wait, the state |alpha> is given, and we need to find the probabilities of measuring it in the eigenstates of A. So to find the probability, I need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A, and then square the coefficients to get the probabilities.

But first, I think I should normalize |alpha>. Let me do that. The given vector is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Calculate the magnitude squared of each coefficient:

Coefficient for |up> is (1 + i): |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Coefficient for |down> is (2 - i): |2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 + 5 =7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Let me write this as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Now, the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x>, which are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate, then the probabilities would be the square of the magnitude.

So, let me compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>:

<+x | alpha> = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (a |up> + b |down> ) ]

Wait, no, more accurately, the inner product is:
