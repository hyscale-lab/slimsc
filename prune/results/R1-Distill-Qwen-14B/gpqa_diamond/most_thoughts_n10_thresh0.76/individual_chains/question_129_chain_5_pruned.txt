Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question gives a series of reactions leading from compound A to E, and there are some hints and options to consider.

First, let's outline the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak at ~1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, which are various cyclic ketones.

I think I should start by figuring out what compound A is, and then track the transformations to E.

Starting with Compound A and the IR data. A peak around 1750 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. But looking at the options, they're all ketones, so maybe A is a ketone.

Now, when A reacts with HCN, it produces B. HCN addition usually happens to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, adding HCN would typically form an cyanohydrin. For example, if A is cyclohexanone, adding HCN would give cyclohexane cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is a cyclic ketone, like cyclopentanone, the product would be a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Wait, but the next step is compound B being reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. So, B must have a functional group that can be hydrogenated. H2 and Pd usually reduce double bonds or maybe nitriles. Wait, HCN addition to a ketone forms a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. So B would be a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group.

Wait, if B is a cyanohydrin, then when you hydrogenate it with H2 and Pd, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to an amine (CH2NH2?) Wait, no, H2 and Pd typically reduce nitriles to amines. Let me think: nitriles (R-CN) upon hydrogenation (H2, Pd) become amines (R-CH2-NH2). But wait, in the case of a cyanohydrin, the structure is R-OH adjacent to CN. So upon hydrogenation, both the CN and any double bonds would be reduced.

Wait, no, the cyanohydrin structure is R2C(OH)-CN. Wait, actually, the structure would be R-C(OH)-CN attached to another
