Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that an isotropic potential means it's the same in all directions, so the potential depends only on the radial distance r. The potential given is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which makes sense because that's the form of a harmonic oscillator.

The particle is moving in this potential, and the question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to find the correct one.

First, I should recall the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total number of quanta. Wait, no, wait. Wait another way: each direction (x, y, z) contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and the total energy is the sum. So, E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

But the states are also degenerate. The degeneracy for each energy level depends on the number of ways the sum n_x + n_y + n_z can equal a particular number. The energy level can be labeled by the principal quantum number, which is the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So, for each n, the degeneracy is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Or wait, maybe it's (n + 2)(n + 1)/2? Wait, no, the number of states for a given n is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Or is that the formula? Let me think. For n=0, it's 1 state. For n=1, how many? 3 states. Wait, (1+1)(1+2)/2 = 2*3/2=3. That's correct. For n=2: (2+1)(2+2)/2 = 3*4/2=6 states. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula for the number of states when n = n_x + n_y +n_z is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to that equation. The formula for that is (n + 2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. So yes, that's right.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy state. So the ground state is n=0 (since n_x = n_y = n_z =0). The first excited state would be n=1, second excited n=2, third excited n=3. Because excited states are counted from the next higher energy levels after the ground state.

So, third excited state implies n=3. So, E = (n + 3/2) ħω = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the energy part.

Now, the number of eigenfunctions for this energy level is the degeneracy, which is (3 + 2)(3 +1)/2 = 5*4/2=10. So there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. Option C says same energy but 3 functions, which seems wrong because the degeneracy is 10. So A would be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me double-check the n value. Third excited, n=3. Because the first excited is n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So energy is (3+3/2)ħω= (9/2)ħω. Correct.

So the correct answer is A. The other options don't match. B and D have energy terms with other units, which don't make sense because the energy should be in terms of ħω. So yeah, A is the right choice.


The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) in the three spatial directions, with the total energy given by:

\[
E = \left( n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2} \right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. The energy levels are degenerate, and the degeneracy for a given total quantum number \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}.
\]

The question asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state. The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). Substituting \( n = 3 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for \( n = 3 \) is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue. Among the given options, only option A matches these results.

Option B and D are incorrect because their energy terms do not have the correct form \( \hbar \omega \). Option C is also incorrect because it incorrectly states the degeneracy as 3 instead of 10.

**Answer: A**
