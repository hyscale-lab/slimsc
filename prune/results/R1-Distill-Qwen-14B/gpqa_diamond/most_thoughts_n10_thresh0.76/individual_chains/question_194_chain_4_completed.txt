Okay, so I've got this physics problem about spins and the partition function. Hmm, I remember that the partition function is important for calculating thermodynamic properties, right? Let me try to think this through.

The setup is three spins, each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Wait, I think J could be positive or negative. Oh wait, in the Ising model, J is usually the exchange interaction energy. If J is positive, it's ferromagnetic, so spins tend to align. But I don't know if that matters here. Maybe it's just a constant.

The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to enumerate all possible states of the three spins and calculate their energies, then sum the exponentials.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 =8 possible states. Let me list them out:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Wait, but maybe there are some symmetries or groupings I can use to avoid checking all 8 individually. Let me think about how the energy depends on the product terms.

Each term in the energy is a product of two spins. Let me compute E for each state.

Let me compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.

State 1: All +1. So each product is +1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. So S1S2 =1, S1S3= -1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

State3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. So S1S2= -1, S1S3=1, S2S3= -1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

State4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2= -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

State5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1. S1S2= -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

State6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2= -1, S1S3=1, S2S3= -1. Sum: -1+1-1= -1. E= J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1. Sum: 1-1-1= -1. E= J.

State8: All -1. So each product is 1. Sum is 3. E= -J*3 = -3J.

Wait, so looking at all the states, only two have E=-3J (states 1 and 8), and the others (numbers 2-7) have E=J.

So for each state, the energy is either -3J or J. Let me count how many states have each energy.

Number of states with E=-3J: 2 (states 1 and 8).

Number of states with E=J: 6 (states 2-7).

So when I compute the partition function Z, I have contributions from these two groups.

Each state contributes exp(β E) to Z because Z = sum_{states} exp(-β E). Wait, wait. Wait, the formula for the partition function is sum over states of exp( -β E ). Because E is the energy of the state. So if E is negative, the exponential becomes positive.

Wait, in this problem, E is given as -J(...). So let me compute each term correctly.

For E = -3J: exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3J β).

For E = J: exp(-β* J).

So Z is sum of exp(3J β) for the 2 states, plus exp(-J β) for the 6 states.

So Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have this form. Let me check the options:

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ) → No, because I have 3Jβ in exp.

Option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ) → Yes, that's what I have.

Wait, but option B is exactly what I get. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check my calculation of the energies.

In state 2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

So S1S2 = 1, S1S3=-1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Yes, that's correct. Same for other states. So 2 states with E=-3J, and 6 with E=J.

So Z=2 exp(3Jβ) +6 exp(-Jβ). Looking at the options, that's option B.


To calculate the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we use the energy expression \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} \exp(-\beta E),
\]
where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Each spin configuration corresponds to a state, and there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. By enumerating all states and calculating their energies, we find:

1. **States with \( E = -3J \):** These occur when all three spins align (all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)). There are 2 such states, and their contribution to \( Z \) is \( 2 \exp(3J\beta) \).

2. **States with \( E = J \):** These occur when one spin is opposite to the other two. There are 6 such states, and their contribution to \( Z \) is \( 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta).
\]

Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A:** \( Z = 2 \exp(-3J\beta) + 6 \exp(J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \) — Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2 \exp(2J\beta) + 6 \exp(-2J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are inconsistent with the energy calculation.
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the coefficients and exponents are inconsistent.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
