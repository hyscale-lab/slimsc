Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. Hmm. The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, wait—proportional to, so I need to normalize it. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must have a norm of 1. So I'll have to find the normalization factor first.

The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So they form an orthonormal basis. That means the inner product of |up> with itself is 1, same for |down>. The inner product of |up> and |down> is zero. So, the square of the norm of |alpha> is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let's compute the magnitudes squared. The magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. Similarly for (2-i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Oh wait, no, because (1+i) and (2-i) are each multiplied by their own terms. So the overall norm is sqrt( (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) ). Wait, no, wait. Actually, the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Because the states |up> and |down> are orthogonal.

Yes, so |1+i|^2 is (1)(1) + (1)(1) from (1+i)(1-i)=1 +1=2. |2-i|^2 is (2)(2) + (-1)(1) =4+1=5. So total is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

Wait, but the question says |alpha> is proportional to that expression. So the state is (1+i, 2-i) multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), as a column vector in the basis [|up>, |down>].

Next, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and zero otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So it looks like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, no, because A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j. So for i=1, j=2, it's hbar/2. Similarly, j=1, i=2, it's hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0       hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0      ]

Hmm, okay. So this is the operator whose eigenstates we need to find, because when we measure the operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenstates in |alpha>.

So, first step: find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator.

The matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Let's find its eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0.

So, determinant of [ -λ   hbar/2; hbar/2  -λ ] equals zero.

The determinant is (λ)^2 - (hbar/2)^2 =0 → λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - ( (hbar)^2 ) /4 =0. So λ² = (hbar^2)/4 → λ = hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So the two eigenvalues are ± hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I) v = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   -hbar/2 ]

Each row is the same: -hbar/2 x + hbar/2 y =0 → -x + y=0 → y =x.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (1,1) multiplied by any scalar. Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2: the matrix becomes:

[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]

Each row: hbar/2 x + hbar/2 y =0 → x + y =0 → y = -x. So eigenvectors are (1, -1).

But wait, these are just the eigenvectors, but they aren't normalized. Let's normalize them.

For λ = hbar/2: the eigenvector is (1,1) → its norm is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2: the eigenvector is (1,-1), normalized
