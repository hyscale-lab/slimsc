Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are A to D, each corresponding to a choice from a to d.

Hmm, density. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So higher mass and smaller volume would mean higher density. But wait, the composition also matters because different materials have different densities. For example, Earth's density is higher than that of something like a gas giant.

Looking at each option:

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because Earth is made of rock and metal. So this planet has the same mass and radius as Earth, so same density. So its density is 5.5.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's interesting. It says the density is 5.5, same as Earth. So regardless of the mass, as long as the density is given, that's the value. But wait, the density is given as 5.5, so this planet's density is 5.5. So same as Earth, same as option a's density.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Oh, composition is the same, so the density would be same as Earth's because density depends on the material. Wait, wait. Because if the composition is the same, then as mass increases, the volume would increase as well. But how does that affect density?

Wait, Earth's density is mass divided by volume. So if mass increases but the composition is same, then the volume would scale with the mass. Wait, mass and volume are related. For a planet, the volume scales with the cube of the radius. Mass depends on density and volume, which is (4/3 π r³) * density. So if the composition is same, the density is same. So if the mass is 5 times Earth's, then the volume would be (5)^1 because density is mass/volume, so if density is same, mass must scale with volume. Wait, but if the mass is 5 times, then the volume is 5 times, so the radius would scale with cube root of (
