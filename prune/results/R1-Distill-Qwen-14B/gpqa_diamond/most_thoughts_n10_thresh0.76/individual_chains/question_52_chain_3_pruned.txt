Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star's surface affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

Alright, so first, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. But when the spots aren't covering the surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? I remember that when a star has spots, those spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the star's total luminosity would decrease because the spots are emitting less light. But how does that affect the measured effective temperature?

Oh, right, the effective temperature is calculated based on the total luminosity and the star's surface area. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. When spots cover part of the surface, the total luminosity is less than what it would be if the entire surface were at 6000 K. But I think the problem is giving the overall Teff after the spots have appeared as 5500 K. Wait, no— because if the spots are cooler, the average Teff would be lower. So the given 5500 K is the new effective temperature when 40% of the surface is spotted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. When a star has spots, the total flux emitted into space is less, so the effective temperature decreases. So the Teff given in the problem when spots are present is 5500 K. But the rest of the star is at 6000 K, but 60% of it (since 40% is spotted) is at 6000 K, and 40% is at a lower temperature. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give the temperature of the spots. Oh, that's right, because the Teff of the star as a whole drops to 5500 K, which is an average of the spotted and unspotted regions.

But wait, the star's photosphere when it's not spotted
