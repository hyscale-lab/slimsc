Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we're given a reaction scheme with compounds A to E, and we need to identify E based on the given information and the options provided. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Also, there are hints provided. So let's think about each step.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN usually reacts with ketones under certain conditions, like in the cyanohydrin reaction. Oh wait, right. When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So compound A must be a ketone. Because HCN adds to the carbonyl group to form a new carbon-carbon bond.

Then, compound B is the cyanohydrin. The structure of B would be something like the original ketone with an added -CN group adjacent to the original carbonyl. Wait, no, wait: the cyanohydrin formation adds a hydroxyl and a cyanide group on adjacent carbons. So the ketone (R2C=O) becomes R2C(OH)CN after reaction with HCN.

Next, step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. So hydrogenation. Since B is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol group and a nitrile group. Wait, but wait. If we have an alcohol and a nitrile, how does the reduction affect that?

Wait, Pd with H2 is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds or maybe for reducing nitriles. Oh, nitriles can be reduced to amines. Wait, yes, typically, H2 with Pd would reduce nitriles (RCN → RCH2NH2?), but wait, that might not be the case. Let me think. Alternatively, the conditions could be for hydrogenation of double bonds, but B is from a ketone plus HCN, so it's a secondary alcohol and a nitrile? Or maybe a primary alcohol?

Wait, the structure of B would be from the original ketone. Let me think if the starting material is a cyclic ketone. Because the problem is about cycloalkanes with substituents. Let's think about the hints.

Hint a says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are used in Wittig reactions. So A, which is a ketone, reacts with a Wittig reagent to form an alkene. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to draw that structure.

So cyclopentane ring. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 4. Wait,
