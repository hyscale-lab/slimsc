Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to determine the major products based on the given reagents. Then, I'll match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+. I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. But wait, after that, H+ is added. Hmm. So K is a strong base, and then maybe an acid workup? Or is H+ part of the reaction itself?

Wait, the starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro means two rings connected by a single atom. The structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol... Let me visualize it. The spiro is between a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring? Or wait, the nomenclature: spiro[m.n]... so the numbers are the bridge positions. So 1-vinyl would be attached to the spiro atom. The molecule has a double bond as well at position 5. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbering.

But regardless, the reaction is with KH in THF, which is a strong base. What does that do to alcohols? Well, alcohol to alkoxide. But then H+ at the end. Hmm, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by some kind of elimination or ring-opening?

Wait, but I recall that when you have a spiro compound and treat it with a strong base, especially under conditions that could lead to elimination, you might get a ring-opening or a rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the starting material has a vinyl group (the 1-vinyl part) attached to the spiro atom. And the rest of the molecule has a non-5-en-1-ol, so it's an alcohol with a double bond. So the molecule is a spiro alcohol with a double bond and a vinyl group.

When treated with a strong base like KH, which is a strong deprotonating agent, perhaps it deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide. Then, with heat or some other condition, maybe an elimination reaction occurs. Wait, but the problem says KH in THF, and then H+. So maybe it's a deprotonation followed by some kind of cyclization or rearrangement.

Alternatively, I'm thinking about the possibility of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which involves hydride shifts in carbocation structures. But wait, does this reaction form a carbocation? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that typically involves vicinal diols.

Alternatively, maybe this is a Birch reduction or some kind of ring-opening via elimination. Alternatively, considering that the product options have bicyclo structures, perhaps this is a ring-opening leading to a bicyclic compound.

Wait, another thought: the starting material
