Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets based on their orbital periods. 

Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the problem says they all have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. That's good because I don't have to worry about varying albedos between the planets.

The planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is 2P1, Planet_3 is 2.5P1, Planet_4 is 3.5P1, and Planet_5 is 5P1. 

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I think the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's the inverse square law, so the temperature should be proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but since the star is the same for all, L and σ are constants. So the temperature inversely depends on the square root of a. Because the formula would be T = T_eff * ( (L/(16πσ a²)) )^(1/4). Let
