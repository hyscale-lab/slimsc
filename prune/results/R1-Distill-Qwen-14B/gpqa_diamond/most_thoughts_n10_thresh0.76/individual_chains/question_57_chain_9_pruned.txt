Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electron scattering experiments. Hmm, phase shifts and scattering amplitude. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀ to δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. Oh wait, and the energy is 50 MeV electrons. The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, which are all in fm units.

I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is calculated using the partial wave expansion. The formula I think is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l [something with Legendre polynomials], but wait, along the incident direction, θ approaches 0°, so maybe there's a simplification?

Wait, when θ is 0°, the scattering is along the beam direction. I think the formula for the scattering amplitude in that case (θ=0) might involve a specific sum. Oh right! For the forward direction, the expression simplifies a bit because the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1), which is 1 for all l. So, the amplitude becomes a sum over all the partial waves.

Wait, more accurately, the expression is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ). But when θ is zero, cosθ is 1, and as I said, P_l(1) is 1. So f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

Hmm, but wait, the imaginary part of f(0). Let me break it down.

Each term in the sum contributes to the imaginary part. Let's see, e^{iδ_l} can be written as cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So when we multiply (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, it's (2l+1)( cosδ_l sinδ_l + i sin²δ_l ). So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

So the imaginary part of f(0) would be (1/k) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Wait, but wait a second. The sum is for l=0 to l_max. I think in this problem, the given phase shifts are for l=0,1,2,3,4. So l_max is 4.

So the imaginary part Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * Σ (from l=0 to 4) (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

But wait, what's k? Oh, right. k is the wave number. For electrons, the wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

Wait, alternatively, I recall that in atomic units or when using certain units, the relation for the scattering amplitude is given in terms of inverse femtometers. Since the answer options are in fm, I think we need to compute k in units of inverse femtometers.
