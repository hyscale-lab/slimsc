Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about two electrons in p orbitals, ignoring their spin. Hmm.

So, the state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> which is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 because it's a p orbital. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. 

The question is about measuring the Lz components for both electrons. Specifically, what's the probability that both L1z and L2z are -침. So, when you measure L1z and L2z, you get -침 each. I need to find the joint probability of that happening.

I remember that for angular momentum, the states are combined using addition of angular momenta. Since each electron is in l=1, combining two l=1 gives possible total l values of 2, 1, or 0. But in this case, the state is specified as having total l=2 and m=-1. So the state is a specific combination of the two individual angular momenta.

But wait, the given state is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this is a coupled state. So when the angular momenta are coupled, the state is expressed in terms of the total angular momentum quantum numbers. But to find the probability of measuring specific values for each electron's Lz, I might need to expand this state into the product of individual states.

Each electron's individual state would be |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>, right? So the coupled state is a combination of these product states. The problem is asking for the probability that each electron has m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because Lz eigenvalues are m침, so m=-1 means eigenvalue is -침.

Wait, so I'm looking for the component of the state |1,1,2,-1> that corresponds to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because the coupled state is a sum of such product states, right?

So the state |l1, l2; l, m> is given. To find the expansion in terms of product states |m1, m2>, I need to compute the
