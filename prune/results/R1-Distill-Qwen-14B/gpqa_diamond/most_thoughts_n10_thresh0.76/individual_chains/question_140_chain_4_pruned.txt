Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all the details. But let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, so it's a solid at room temperature but just barely melting when it gets a bit warmer.

Also, there's a mention of a product when a certain keto acid reacts with X, containing two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and has a heavier isotope. Hmm, okay.

Let me start by thinking about what X could be. When I hear "reagent in organic chemistry" and "heavier isotope," I'm thinking maybe something like a halogen, since they often have isotopes. Like, maybe X is something like sulfuric acid? Or perhaps another strong acid. Wait, but wait, what about sodium or something else? Or maybe it's a heavier halogen, like chlorine. Let me think.

The reaction with liquid Y is violent. A common violent reaction is between metals and acids. For example, sodium reacting with water would produce hydrogen gas. But wait, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. If W is H2, then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. Oh, wait, maybe it's another gas. What about CH4? No, that has 6 neutrons and 6 protons (since C has 6 protons and H has 1 each, but wait CH4's molecule is C with 6 protons, and H's each have 1. So total protons: 6 +4=10. Neutrons: C has 6, H each have 0. So 6 neutrons. That doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible diatomic gases. Like O2: each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons in the common isotope. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits because 16 each. So W could be O2? Or maybe another gas. Alternatively, CO2? No, that's triatomic. Wait, but the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So for each molecule.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's CO. Let's see, C has 6 protons, O has 8. So the molecule has 6+8=14 protons. For neutrons: C-12 has 6 neutrons, O-16 has 8, so total 14. Oh, wait, so 14 protons and 14 neutrons in the molecule. That fits. So W could be CO. But what reaction releases carbon monoxide?

Alternatively, maybe it's a noble gas like He? No, He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons? Wait, He is usually He
