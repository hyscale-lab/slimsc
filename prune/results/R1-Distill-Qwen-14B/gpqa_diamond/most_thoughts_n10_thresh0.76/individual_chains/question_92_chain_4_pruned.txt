Okay, so I have this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, enthalpy of formation... I remember that it's the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I need to figure out how to calculate this using the given bond energies.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me try to visualize its structure. It looks like a hydrocarbon with multiple double bonds and branching. Wait, maybe I should count the number of each type of bond in the molecule. Because to find the enthalpy of formation, I think the formula involves using the bond energies and the standard enthalpies of the elements.

I recall the formula: The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of a molecule is calculated using the bond energies of the reactants (elements) and products (the molecule). The general equation is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

But wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, it's the sum of the bond energies of the products minus the sum of the reactants, multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients. Or wait, no, I think it's the sum of the bond energies broken (reactants) minus the sum of the bond energies formed (products). Because bond breaking is endothermic, so when you subtract, you get the enthalpy change.

Wait, actually, the formula I remember is:

ΔH = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy used to break bonds in the reactants and the energy released when forming bonds in the products. So when bonds are broken, energy is absorbed, and when formed, energy is released. So the overall enthalpy change is (sum of bond energies of reactants) minus (sum of bond energies of products).

Wait, but for the enthalpy of formation, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, and the product is the molecule. So for a molecule like this, which is a hydrocarbon, the reactants would be carbon and hydrogen gases. So I need to calculate the total bond energies in the molecule and compare it to the bond energies in the elements.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the number of each type of bond in the molecule.
2. Calculate the total bond energy for each type.
3. Sum all the bond energies in the molecule (this is the energy required to break all bonds, which is a positive value).
4. Calculate the bond energies for the elements (carbon and hydrogen) that would form the molecule.
5. Subtract the bond energies of the elements from the bond energies of the molecule to get the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but wait. The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of products)]

But here, the reactants are the elements (C and H2), and the product is the molecule.

Wait no, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of the elements) - (sum of
