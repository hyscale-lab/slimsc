Okay, so I've got this problem here about space travel and time dilation. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about an astronaut from an alien civilization traveling at a very high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their spacecraft is heading to Earth, and we need to figure out how long the journey will take from the astronaut's perspective. The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 solar years. The options suggest either they die before reaching Earth or the time taken is around 70-80 years.

Wait, so the key here is time dilation, right? Because when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down from the perspective of a stationary observer, but the astronaut's own time (proper time) is shorter.

Hmm, so the problem is asking for the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. Proper time is the shortest possible time between two events for the traveler. So we need to calculate the proper time for the journey.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the distance. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from Earth. But the problem doesn't give us the exact distance, so maybe I should think differently.

Wait, the problem says 'the average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.' So the astronaut is 22 now, so they have about 128 years left on average. If their lifetime is about 150 years on average, but from their own frame of reference, how does that tie into the journey time?

Wait, no. The problem is about the time taken for the journey as experienced by the astronaut. So the question is, given their speed, how much time will pass for them when they reach Earth.

So the journey's time from Earth's frame would be distance divided by speed. But since the distance isn't given, perhaps I can approach it using the concept of time dilation and Lorentz factors.

Wait, no, because Earth is the destination, but the distance is fixed. Wait, but the question is about the astronaut's experienced time, so we need to calculate the proper time.

The formula for proper time in special relativity is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame, and v is the
