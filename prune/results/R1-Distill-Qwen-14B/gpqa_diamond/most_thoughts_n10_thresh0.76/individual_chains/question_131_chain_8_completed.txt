Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, I'll read through the question carefully.

So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions and NMR spectroscopy. It's a bit involved, but I'll take it slowly.

The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. This acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. From the 1H and 13C NMR data, this anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm and two peaks in the carbon spectrum at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 

Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products: major and minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3. 

The key clue comes from the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product shows a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. I remember that NOESY detects through-space proximity between protons, so the cross-peak indicates that those two protons are close in space, even if they're not necessarily adjacent on the structure.

The question asks which two resonances in the major product are connected by this cross-peak.

Let me think about the structures involved.

First, the starting material: a cis-dicarboxylic acid. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The dehydration of a diacid to an anhydride typically forms a five-membered cyclic anhydride, especially if the diacid has two adjacent carboxylic acid groups. But wait, the question says it's a cis-alkene. Oh, wait, maybe the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH? No, that wouldn't have a cis-alkene. Oh, wait, no, perhaps the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH but with a double bond, like HOOC-CH2CH2CH=CH-COOH? Wait, no, no, wait, that's a diene. Wait, maybe it's a diacid with a cis double bond. So, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the middle carbons, making them cis. So perhaps the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2CH2CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons, making it cis. So, when dehydrated, the two carboxylic acid groups would lose water and form an anhydride. 

Wait, but the dehydration of a diacid with two carboxylic groups would form an anhydride, yes. The structure of the anhydride would have the two carbonyl groups connected via an oxygen bridge. For example, if the diacid was HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH (but with a double bond between the two CH2's, making it cis), then the anhydride would have the structure where the two CO groups are connected via an oxygen bridge.

But wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene. So, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no, that's not a double bond. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2CH=CH-COOH, but in a cis configuration. So, the double bond is between the CH2 and CH groups, making them cis. So, the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is in the cis configuration.

Wait, but when such a diacid is dehydrated, the anhydride forms, which would connect the two carboxylic acid groups. So, the anhydride would be a cyclic structure, probably a five-membered ring if possible. So, the structure would have an oxygen bridge between the two carbonyls.

Now, looking at the NMR data for the anhydride. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a downfield region, so maybe an aromatic proton? Wait, but the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene. So, perhaps the anhydride has some kind of conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is formed from a diacid with a conjugated diene. But wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene, so maybe it's a diacid with a double bond in the middle, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond in cis configuration.

When this diacid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The structure would be cyclic, likely a five-membered ring. So, the anhydride would have the two carbonyl groups connected via an oxygen bridge, and the remaining part would be a double bond, which was originally in the diacid.

Wait, but if the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, dehydrating it would lose two water molecules and form an anhydride. So, perhaps the structure becomes a cyclic anhydride where there's a double bond adjacent to the oxygen bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a diene. Wait, no, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it cis. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH where the middle two CH2 are actually a CH2-CH2 but with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but as a cis diene. Wait, that doesn't make sense because CH2-CH2 with a double bond would be CH2=CH, so perhaps HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the diacid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond in the cis configuration. So, when it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The structure would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. 7 ppm is typical for aromatic protons, but the starting material doesn't have any aromatic rings. So, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl group, which can be deshielded and appear around 2-3 ppm. But 7 ppm is higher than that. Alternatively, perhaps it's an olefinic proton.

Wait, but if the anhydride has a double bond, the protons on the double bond would be around 5-6 ppm, maybe lower. But 7 ppm is more like aromatic. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has a carbonyl group, and the protons adjacent to it are showing up elsewhere.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. How many protons are there? The question doesn't specify the integral, so perhaps it's a triplet or something else, but the question says "a single peak". So maybe it's a singlet, like three equivalent protons, but that's speculative.

Wait, maybe the anhydride has a bridge structure. Let me think: the anhydride would have two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen bridge. If the starting material has a cis double bond, the resulting anhydride would have a similar arrangement. So, perhaps the structure is a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the diacid is a trans-diacid? No, the question says cis-alkene.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, perhaps the diacid has a structure like HOOC-(CH2)3-COOH, but with a double bond in the middle. So, the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH, but that would be a longer chain. Dehydration would form an anhydride. But that's a six-membered ring, perhaps.

But the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. So perhaps the anhydride has an aromatic ring? No, because the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene, not an aromatic ring. Wait, unless the dehydration leads to an aromatic structure, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm peak is due to an olefinic proton in a conjugated system.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is formed in such a way that the double bond is part of the ring. So, a cyclic anhydride with a double bond inside the ring. So, perhaps it's a five-membered ring with a double bond adjacent to the oxygen bridge.

Wait, for example, the structure could be:

O
||
O-C-(CH2)-C-O
       ||  
       CH2

Wait, no, perhaps it's a cyclic structure like:

O
||
O-C-(CH2)-CH2-C-O
       ||  
       O

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is a six-membered ring with a double bond.

But perhaps I should move on and think about the reaction of the anhydride with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.

So, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is a diene. It's a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4. So the structure is:

CH2=C-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but that's not right). Let me draw it.

It's a cyclopentadiene with the double bonds at positions 1 and 3. So the positions are:

1: CH2-
2: CH2-
3: CH2-
4: CH2-

Wait, no, perhaps it's a cyclopentadiene where the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4. So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-

But that's not a diene. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring. But the compound is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, each of the carbons 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group. So, the structure is:

Positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl group, and the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4. So the ring is:

C1 (CH2)=C2-CH2-C3=CH4-CH2-C5? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The ring is five-membered, with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So, positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So, the structure would be:

CH2=C-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense in a ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl group. So, the structure would be:

C(CH3)=C(CH3)-C(CH3)=C(CH3)-CH2, but that's not possible in a five-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps it's:

The cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with four substituents: each of carbons 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group, and the ring has double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So, the structure is something like:

CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2, but again, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The cyclopentadiene has double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So, positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl group. So the structure would be:

1   2   3   4   5
CH3-C=C-C=C-CH3

Wait, that can't be right because that would require the ring to have four carbons with methyl groups, but cyclopentadiene is five-membered. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a five-membered ring where positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups, and the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4. So the structure is:

1: CH2 (but with a methyl group)
Wait, no, perhaps it's:

1: C(CH3)=C(CH3)-2
  |
2: C(CH3)-3
  |
3: C(CH3)=C(CH3)-4
  |
4: CH2-5
  |
5: CH2-

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, but perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact structure, focusing on the reaction.

The reaction between the anhydride and the diene. Anhydrides can react with dienes in a Diels-Alder reaction. The Diels-Alder reaction is between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered cyclic structure. The dienophile here would be the anhydride, as anhydrides are good dienophiles.

So, the anhydride, acting as the dienophile, would react with the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) in a Diels-Alder reaction.

The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds. The reaction is stereospecific and forms a bicyclic structure if the diene is part of a ring.

But wait, the diene in this case is a conjugated diene, so the reaction should proceed. The product would be a bicyclic structure, perhaps. Alternatively, since the diene is a substituted cyclopentadiene, the Diels-Alder adduct would form a bicyclo structure.

But the problem states that two products are formed: major and minor. So, maybe there are two possible transition states or two possible regiochemical outcomes. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to endo and exo products, but in this case, considering the structure of the anhydride and the diene, perhaps the major product is the endo transition state.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride can react in two different ways based on the position of the dienophile. For example, if the anhydride has two carbonyl groups, perhaps the diene can attack from either face, leading to different stereoisomers.

Wait, but the question mentions that both products have the same molecular formula, so they must be constitutional isomers or stereoisomers. The molecular formula is C13H16O3.

Wait, the initial anhydride must contribute a certain number of carbons, and the diene contributes the rest. Let's do the math. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's count its carbons. The cyclopentadiene (five-membered ring) with four methyl groups. So, the cyclopentadiene has 5 carbons in the ring and 4 methyl groups, each with one carbon, so 5 + 4 = 9 carbons in total. But wait, each methyl is a CH3 group attached to the ring. So the diene has 5 (ring) + 4*1 (methyl) = 9 carbons. The anhydride comes from a dicarboxylic acid. Let's say the acid is HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH. But wait, the original acid has a cis-alkene. So, the diacid is HOOC-(CH2)m-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond making it HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH, perhaps? Wait, but that would be a five-carbon diacid. Dehydration would form an anhydride with that structure. So, the anhydride would have perhaps 5 carbons (the four from the CH2 groups and the two carbonyls? Wait, no. Wait, the diacid is HOOC-(CH2)2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH. So the anhydride would have a structure where the oxygen bridges the two carbonyls and the double bond is still present.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride has 5 carbons (the two from the carboxylic acids and three from the alkene). So, when it reacts with the diene (9 carbons), the product would have 5 (anhydride) + 9 (dien) - 2 (from the two carbonyls lost) = 12 carbons? Wait, no, the molecular formula is C13H16O3.

Wait, the diene has 9 carbons (5 in the ring plus four methyl groups). The anhydride, from the diacid, let's say the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH. So the diacid has 6 carbons (two COOH groups and four in the chain). Dehydration would form an anhydride, which would have 6 - 2 (water lost) = 4 carbons? No, wait, dehydration of a diacid forms an anhydride by removing two H2O molecules? No, wait, each dehydration of a carboxylic acid would lose a water, but for a diacid, two dehydrations would form an anhydride. So, for example, HOOC-R-COOH would lose two H2O to form R-CO-O-CO-R, but that's a linear anhydride, which is not favored. More likely, it forms a cyclic anhydride, which would have (n-2) carbons, where n is the number of carbons in the diacid.

Wait, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, which has 6 carbons (including both COOH groups). Dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride with 4 carbons, perhaps. Wait, the diacid is HOOC-(CH2)2-CH=CH-COOH, so 6 carbons. Dehydration would form an anhydride with the structure O=C-O-C=O connected via the four CH2 groups. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride has four carbons. So, when it reacts with the diene (9 carbons), the product would have 4 + 9 = 13 carbons, which matches the molecular formula given (C13H16O3). So that makes sense.

So, the product is the Diels-Alder adduct between the anhydride (dienophile) and the diene (dien). The adduct would have a six-membered ring with substituents from both reactants.

Now, the two products (major and minor) likely result from different regiochemistry or stereochemistry in the Diels-Alder reaction. But the major product is the endo transition state, which is more favorable.

But the key point is the NOESY spectrum. The major product shows a cross-peak between two protons that are close in space, while the minor doesn't. So, which protons are these?

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state leads to the substituents being on the same face, leading to certain spatial arrangements. So, the cross-peak in the NOESY would indicate that these protons are on adjacent carbons but not necessarily directly bonded.

Wait, but the NOESY cross-peak connects two protons that are close in space, regardless of their connectivity. So, in the major product, certain protons are close, leading to a cross-peak, while in the minor product, they're not.

Looking at the options, the 1H NMR integrals are given for each option.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

So, this could be two sets of protons: six in a singlet (possibly methyl groups), and one as a doublet (maybe a CH group adjacent to something).

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm.

This could be two singlets, perhaps from equivalent methyl groups and another group, like an oxygen-bearing CH2.

Option C: 6H singlet at 1 ppm and 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm. Perhaps two sets of equivalent methyl groups.

Option D: 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. Maybe a CH group and an oxygen-bearing CH2.

The cross-peak in the NOESY suggests that these two sets of protons are spatially close. So, which pairs of protons would be near each other in the product?

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo rule would position substituents on the same face, leading to certain spatial arrangements.

In the structure, perhaps the diene contributes substituents (like methyl groups) that are on the same face as the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride). So, in the major product, the substituents from the diene (like the methyl groups) are positioned near the substituents from the anhydride.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, all four positions (1,2,3,4) on the ring have methyl groups. When it undergoes Diels-Alder reaction, the endo transition state would bring the methyl groups on the same face as the electron-deficient dienophile (the anhydride). So, in the adduct, the substituents from the diene (methyl groups) would be positioned near the endo face.

So, in the product, the methyl groups from the diene would be near the carbonyl groups from the anhydride.

Now, regarding the NOESY cross-peak. For example, if in the major product, a methyl group is near a carbonyl group, the protons on the methyl would be close to the protons on the oxygen-bearing group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak connects a methyl group (singlet) with another group, like an adjacent CH2 or CH.

Wait, looking at the options, let's think about what each option represents.

Option C: 6H singlet at 1 ppm and 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm. That would be two sets of six equivalent protons. Could these be two sets of methyl groups that are either close or far apart.

Option A: 6H singlet and 1H doublet. Maybe a methyl group (6H) and a CH group next to it.

Option B: 6H singlet and 2H singlet. Perhaps a methyl group and a CH2 group near a carbonyl.

Option D: 1H doublet and 2H singlet. Maybe a CH and a CH2.

In the major product, the cross-peak connects two protons that are close in space. So, perhaps these are protons on adjacent carbons that are in proximity, but not necessarily bonded.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak connects a methyl group (say, at 1 ppm) with a proton that's on a neighboring carbon, such as an oxygen-bearing CH2 group.

Wait, but in the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the diene (methyl groups) would be positioned in the endo transition state near the substituents of the dienophile. So, if the dienophile has substituents (like carbonyl groups), the diene's substituents (methyl groups) would be positioned near them.

So, in the product, the methyl groups would be near the carbonyl oxygens, which are in the adduct structure. Therefore, the methyl protons (singlet at 1 ppm or 1.7 ppm) would be near the carbonyl groups, which might have adjacent protons, perhaps on a CH2 group.

Wait, in the 13C NMR of the anhydride, there are two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is probably a carbonyl group (maybe a carbonyl carbon, which is around 170-220 ppm), but wait, 165 ppm is about right for a carbonyl. The 137 ppm could be a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, perhaps a CH.

Wait, perhaps the 137 ppm is a carbon with a double bond, as sp² carbons are around 120-140 ppm. So, the anhydride's structure has a double bond, as per the starting material.

So, when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the dienophile (anhydride) would have the carbonyl groups, and the diene would contribute the conjugated double bonds.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the bridge would form between the dienophile and diene, leading to substituents from both reactants being in close proximity.

So, in the major product, the methyl groups from the diene (which are in positions 1,2,3,4) would be positioned near the carbonyl groups of the anhydride.

Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak in the major product would connect a methyl group (singlet at 1.7 ppm, perhaps) with a proton that's near the carbonyl, such as a CH2 group that's adjacent to the carbonyl.

Looking back at the options, option B says 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. So, perhaps the 6H singlet is from the methyl groups, and the 2H singlet is from a CH2 group attached to an oxygen (like OCH2).

So, if these two groups are in close proximity in the major product, their protons would show a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum.

Alternatively, option D has a 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. The doublet might be a CH next to a CH2, and the singlet a CH2 near an oxygen.

But the cross-peak in the major product implies that these two groups are close. So, considering the structures, the methyl groups (which would be a singlet) and a nearby CH2 near an oxygen would be the likely candidates.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. So, the 2H at 3.5 ppm could be a CH2O group. If the two groups are near each other, the cross-peak would connect them.

Alternatively, option A is 6H singlet at 1 ppm (maybe methyl) and 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm (maybe a CH next to a quaternary carbon).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak connects a methyl group (6H singlet) with a proton that's on an adjacent carbon, like a CH2 group that's next to the methyl groups.

Wait, but in the major product, the arrangement would place the methyl groups near the carbonyl, so their protons would be close to the protons on the adjacent carbons, possibly leading to a cross-peak.

So, putting this together, the cross-peak in the major product would connect the methyl group (singlet) to a CH2 group that's near the carbonyl, perhaps as part of the six-membered ring.

Looking at the options, option B has a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm, which might be a CH2 attached to an oxygen (like OCH2), and a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm, which is a methyl group. If these are adjacent, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, option D has a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet, which might be a CH and a CH2 group in close proximity.

But considering the NOESY cross-peak is present only in the major product, which is the endo product, the spatial arrangement would place the methyl groups near the oxygen-bearing groups, leading to their protons being in close proximity.

So, perhaps the cross-peak connects the methyl group (singlet at 1.7 ppm) with the CH2 group attached to the oxygen (singlet at 3.5 ppm). So, the two sets of protons are in close proximity, leading to the cross-peak.

Looking at the options, option B is 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. Thus, these two sets of protons would be near each other in the major product, leading to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, option D has a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet, which could be a CH and a CH2 group.

Wait, another approach: in the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state positions the substituents to maximize orbital overlap and possibly proximity. So, the substituents from the diene (methyl groups) would be on the same face as the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride's carbonyl groups).

Thus, the methyl groups from the diene are now near the carbonyl groups of the anhydride. The CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl would be in proximity to the methyl groups, leading to NOESY cross-peaks.

So, if the CH2 group is attached to the oxygen (like OCH2), and the methyl groups are nearby, their protons would be close in space, leading to a cross-peak.

If the CH2 is a singlet at 3.5 ppm, that would imply it's symmetric and not split by neighboring protons, perhaps because it's attached to an oxygen and has two equivalent protons. The methyl groups, being in a singlet, are likely in a symmetric environment, so a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm.

So, the cross-peak would connect the 6H methyl singlet and the 2H CH2 singlet.

Looking at the options, option B says 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. So these would be the two resonances connected by the cross-peak.

Alternatively, option C has two methyl groups, but I'm not sure they would be adjacent to the same CH2 group.

So, the answer would be option B.


The problem involves the reaction of a cyclic anhydride derived from a cis-dicarboxylic acid with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products (major and minor) with the molecular formula C13H16O3. The key clue is the presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product, indicating spatial proximity between two sets of protons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The anhydride is formed by dehydration of a cis-dicarboxylic acid, likely with a structure containing a double bond. Its 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, suggesting a deshielded proton, possibly near a carbonyl group. The 13C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm indicate sp² carbons, consistent with a carbonyl and a double bond.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The anhydride acts as the dienophile, and the 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene acts as the diene. The reaction forms a bicyclic Diels-Alder adduct. The major product corresponds to the endo transition state, where substituents on the diene (methyl groups) are positioned near the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (carbonyl groups).

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak**:  
   The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product indicates spatial proximity between two sets of protons. In the endo product, the methyl groups from the diene are positioned near the carbonyl groups of the anhydride. This spatial arrangement suggests that the methyl protons are close to protons on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial proximity between methyl groups and CH2 groups near carbonyls.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet corresponds to methyl groups, and the 2H singlet corresponds to a CH2 group near a carbonyl. These groups are spatially close in the endo product, consistent with the NOESY cross-peak.  
   - **Option C**: Two 6H singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm. These represent two sets of methyl groups but do not account for the proximity to a CH2 group near a carbonyl.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This represents a CH group and a CH2 group but does not match the expected methyl group proximity.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (methyl groups) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (CH2 group near a carbonyl). This is consistent with the spatial arrangement in the endo product. 

**Answer: B**
