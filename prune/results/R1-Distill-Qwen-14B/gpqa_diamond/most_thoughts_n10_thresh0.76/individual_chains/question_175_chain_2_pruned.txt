Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. The question is asking two things: what fraction of A is radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and what's the possible form of f as a function of lambda.

The options are A to D. The options give fractions and functional forms. Right, so I need to figure out both the fraction and the dependence on lambda.

First, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since this is a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis, I think the radiation will be dipole-like. Wait, no, a dipole is usually a different shape, maybe more like a dumbbell. But the spheroidal shape might imply a quadrupole or something else? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, a dipole has two lobes, so maybe this is a dipole radiation. But I'm not entirely sure.

In dipole radiation, the power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle theta. I remember that the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula: the power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sin^2 theta), and the maximum occurs at 90 degrees (theta = pi/2), which is the equator. But wait, in this problem, the maximum is A, and the question is about the fraction at theta=30 degrees.

Wait, but if the maximum is at theta=90, then the power at theta=30 would be a fraction of that. The formula for the radiation pattern in dipole is (sin^2 theta), but wait, let me get it right. The radiation intensity pattern for an oscillating dipole is given by u = ( (d^2 E/dz^2) )^2 * sin^2 theta, but actually, the power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole is proportional to sin^2 theta. So, u = k sin^2 theta, where k is some constant.

So, the maximum occurs when sin theta is maximum, which is at theta = 90 degrees (pi/2 radians). So at theta=90, sin theta is 1, so u_max is k. At theta=30 degrees, sin theta is 0.5, so u = k*(0.5)^2 = 0.25 k. So the fraction would be 0.25 (k is the maximum), so the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the maximum power is A. So A is the maximum value of f, which is the power per unit solid angle. So, if at theta=30, the power per unit solid angle is (1/4) A, then the fraction would be (1/4 A) / A = 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

But let me think again. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the maximum is A, which is the maximum value of f. So when theta is 90 degrees, f is A, and when theta is 30, f is (sin^2 30) * A. Because sin(30) is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So yes, the fraction is 0.25*A, so 1/4 of the maximum.

So the fraction is 1/4. Looking at the options, which options have 1/4 as the fraction?

Options B and C. Now, the second part is about the possible form of f as a function of lambda. So the question is, what is f(lambda, theta)?

I remember that the dipole radiation power per unit solid angle (the radiation pattern) is proportional to (1/lambda^4), because the radiation power for an accelerating charge is proportional to (acceleration)^2, and the acceleration for an oscillating charge is proportional to (frequency squared), which relates to 1/lambda^2. However, the total power radiated is proportional to (1/lambda^4) because of the integration over the radiation fields, but the power per unit solid angle is different.

Wait, no, let me think again. The power radiated by a dipole is given by P_total = ( (e^2 a^2) / (6 pi epsilon_0 c^3) )
