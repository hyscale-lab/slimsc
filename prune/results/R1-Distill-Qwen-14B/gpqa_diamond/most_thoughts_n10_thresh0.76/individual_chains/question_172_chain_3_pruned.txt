Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my studies. Let me think.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh right, because k (Boltzmann's constant) is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference Î”E is equal to k times the temperature difference or something? Or maybe it's the same as k*T, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the problem states that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation applies here. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative population of two energy levels. The formula I remember is (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

In this case, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So I think n1 (excited state in star_1) is twice n2 (same state in star_2). Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact setup. Let me parse it again.

Wait, the same energy level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So for a given energy
