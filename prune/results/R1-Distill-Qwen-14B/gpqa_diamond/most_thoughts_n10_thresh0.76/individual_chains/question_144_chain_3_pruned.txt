Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the lifetime of a particle (Δt) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), which is the width Γ. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so Δt ≈ ħ/(2ΔE). But wait, more accurately, it's Γ = ħ/τ, where Γ is the decay width (like the total width) and τ is the mean lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the velocity of the particle by the lifetime. Oh, wait, the velocity is needed because distance is velocity times time. So the distance L = v * τ.

But wait, the particle is produced with some energy E. Its mass is m, so I can find its velocity from that. The energy E is the total energy, so E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ = E/(m c²). Then, the velocity v = c * sqrt(
