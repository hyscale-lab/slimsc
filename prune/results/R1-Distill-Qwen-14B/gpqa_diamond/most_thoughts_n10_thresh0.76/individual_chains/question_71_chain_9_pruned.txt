Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it carefully.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets based on their orbital periods. So, first, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from its star. The formula, I think, is something like T = T_star * ( L / (16πσd²) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe I should recall the simplified version. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_eff / (2)^0.5 * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/4 ), but since it's a circular orbit, the eccentricity e is zero. So the formula simplifies. Also, since albedo A is the same for all planets, that factor cancels out when taking the ratio.

Wait, but more accurately, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) depends on the semi-major axis (a), right? The formula is T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) / sqrt(2) ) * ( (1) / (a) )^(1/2 ). Because the star's effective temperature is T_eff, but I think the formula can be expressed as proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but perhaps it's easier to relate the temperatures based on the ratio of their distances.

Hmm, another approach. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, no, because Kepler's third law relates the period (P) to the semi-major axis (a). The law is P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So, a³ is proportional to P², meaning a is proportional to P^(2/3). So, a is proportional to P^(2/3), which would mean that the distance from the star increases with the 2/3 power of the period.

But how does that affect the equilibrium temperature? Since T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance (because T goes as (L/(sigma * a^2))^(1/4 ), so T ~ 1/sqrt(a) when L and other factors are constant. Wait, let me double-check. The formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) )^(1/2), or perhaps more accurately, considering the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Wait, let's get it right. The equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4 )

Since L is the star's luminosity, which is constant for all planets, and A is the same for all, the ratio of their temperatures will be based on a. So T_eq is inversely proportional to a^(1/2), because [1/a²]^1/4 is 1/a^(1/2).

So, T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a), or T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).

But since a is proportional to P^(2/3) (from Kepler's law), because a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3). So substituting this into the temperature equation, T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3)) ^ (-1/2) = P^(-1/3).

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If a is proportional to P^(2/3), then 1/sqrt(a) is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so T_eq is proportional to P^(-1/3). So the temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

So the ratio of temperatures would be (P1/P2)^(-1/3).

Wait, but the question is about the ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3) because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Wait wait, no. Let me rephrase.

If T ∝ P^(-1/3
