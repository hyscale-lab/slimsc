Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm not super confident about this, but let's try to break it down.

So the question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. I remember that decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and speed. Oh wait, right, the mean decay distance (L) is calculated by L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. 

But wait, particles like mesons are bosons, but the formula should be similar to how we calculate it for other particles. So I think the first step is to find the lifetime τ. I remember that the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. Oh right, because the width Γ is related to the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime is the uncertainty in time via the Heisenberg principle. 

But let me make sure. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy width of the particle's resonance. So yes, τ is inversely proportional to Γ. 

But wait, I'm dealing with units here. Let me think about the units. ħ (h-bar) has units of GeV·s, right? Because Planck's constant h is in J·s, and J is equivalent to GeV when converted. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ will be in seconds.

Wait, the width Γ here is given as 320 MeV. Oh, I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, wait, wait – I think ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm, but in terms of GeV, that's 0.19733 GeV·fm. Hmm, maybe I should be careful with the units here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use natural units where ħ = 1 in units of GeV·s. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me get the exact value of ħ in GeV·s. Oh right, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV·s is a very small unit.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the mean lifetime τ is τ = ħ / Γ. So with Γ in GeV, and ħ in GeV·s, τ would be in seconds.

So let's compute τ first. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So
