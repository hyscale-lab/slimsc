Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on its reaction and the NMR data of the product. Let's see what I can figure out.

First, the reaction conditions: Compound X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh wait, no, actually, isn't that more like a catalyst for some reactions? Or maybe it's used in specific ring-opening conditions. Wait, I think it's a bulky base, so maybe it's involved in an acid-catalyzed reaction? Or perhaps it's used in ring-opening via a different mechanism. Oh, right! I think in some cases, especially with epoxides, if you have a strong base, it can cause ring opening. Alternatively, maybe this is related to an elimination reaction or a rearrangement.

Wait, wait. I think 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base used in the Ring-Opening of epoxides. Maybe it's part of an epoxide ring-opening reaction, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, could it be a base used in an elimination reaction? Let's think about the product's NMR to see what the structure might look like.

Looking at the product's NMR data. Let's break down the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, likely a methyl group attached to something that doesn't cause splitting. Maybe a CH3 connected to an electronegative atom or a quaternary carbon. Maybe a substituent on a benzene ring, like a methyl group in a para position?

- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, same integration. So perhaps two different methyl groups? Or maybe the same group. Wait, but two singlets with the same integration but slightly different shifts—like maybe two methyl groups in different environments.

But wait, maybe these are two separate methyl groups attached to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has two methyl groups attached to an oxygen, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, they could be adjacent to double bonds or other structures.

Next, aromatic protons:
- 6.75 (1H, d): A doublet. So probably part of a coupling with one neighboring proton.
- 7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Maybe a pair of protons in a para-substituted benzene, or adjacent to substituents.
- 7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet, possibly adjacent to another proton.
- 7.71 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Maybe ortho to substituents or part of a conjugated system.

The 13C NMR:
Looking at the carbons:

- δ 21.3 (1C, s): A quaternary carbon? Or maybe a methyl. Wait, since in 13C NMR, a singlet means no neighboring carbons. So 21.3 is a low shift, probably a CH3 group attached to an electronegative atom or in a specific environment. Like maybe a CH3O group? Or a CH3 connected to something else.

Wait, another methyl at 28.4. That's a bit higher, maybe a CH3 attached to a carbon that's part of a ring or adjacent to a double bond?

Then, the aromatic carbons:

- 126.9 (2C, s): Two carbons, maybe a pair of equivalent aromatic carbons, like in a para-substituted benzene ring. Or perhaps adjacent to substituents.

- 127.1 (1C, s): One carbon, maybe a substituent on the ring.

- 129.1 (2C, s): Two more aromatic carbons. Hmm, perhaps part of a conjugated system.

- 130.3 (1C, s): Another aromatic carbon.

Then, some higher shifts: 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C, s). Those are likely carbons attached to electronegative atoms or part of a conjugated system. For example, a carbonyl group (but wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl carbon. So that's likely a ketone, aldehyde, or another carbonyl group.

Wait, 197.7 is a high shift for a carbonyl. Aldehydes are around 190-205 ppm. So maybe a ketone? No, ketones are usually around 205-220? Wait, no, wait: Actually, aldehydes are higher, like 95-205 ppm? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on exact ranges, but 197 is probably a ketone or an aldehyde. But wait, if it's a carbonyl, maybe the product is a ketone or something with a carbonyl group.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction. The starting material is Compound X (C11H12O), and it's treated with this base. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and the reaction opens the epoxide ring.

Wait, if X is an epoxide, and the reaction is ring-opening, then the product would have a structure where the epoxide oxygen is replaced by something else. But wait, the base might abstract a proton adjacent to the epoxide, leading to ring opening. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is an epoxide, and under basic conditions, the ring opens. So the product would have an alcohol or an ether group, but considering the NMR data, perhaps it's a diol? But looking at the NMR, I don't see OH protons, so maybe it's an elimination reaction instead, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, so if the epoxide ring opens via a base, it could form a carbonyl group. Like, for example, if the base deprotonates a position adjacent to the epoxide, leading to ring opening and formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, but let me think about the starting material. The formula is C11H12O. So, if it's an epoxide, the formula would be something like (C11H10O)x? Wait, wait, perhaps the structure of X is an epoxide, like a styryl epoxide.

Looking at the options, options A, B, C, D are all various epoxides.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. Styryl is a benzene ring with a CH2CH2 group, but wait, styryl is a vinyl benzene group, like CH2=CHPh.

Wait, 2-styrylepoxide would be an epoxide where the oxygen is between two carbons, one of which is part of a styryl group. So maybe the structure is something like O in a three-membered ring with a styryl group attached.

But the product after reaction with the base—
