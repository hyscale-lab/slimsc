Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance. The given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to connect these two.

Wait, parallax (pl) is the reciprocal of distance. Oh right, the formula is pl = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if pl is inversely proportional to d, then d is inversely proportional to pl. So d = 1/pl. That's important because the number of stars is given in terms of pl, but the question is about how it changes with distance.

The problem states that the number of stars (let's call it N) varies with parallax as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Oh wait, maybe the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx^5), but I'm not sure if that's the same as 1/(plx)^5. Wait, probably not. Wait, maybe the question says it's proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Or perhaps it's plx to the fifth power in the denominator. So N ∝ 1/(plx^5).

Wait, maybe I should write this down. Let me clarify. Suppose the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N = k * (1/(plx^5)) where k is some constant. But I need to express this in terms of distance d, because the question is about the change with distance.

Since pl is the parallax, and d = 1/pl (parallax in parsecs, I think), then pl = 1/d. So plx is 1/(d). So plx^5 would be (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. 

Substituting that into N: N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx^5) = plx^(-5). Since pl is 1/d, then plx^(-5)
