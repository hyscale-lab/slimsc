Okay, so I'm looking at this question where I have to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me break down the information given and try to figure it out step by step.

First, the IR data. There are strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those peaks are probably from N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, O-H in carboxylic acids or alcohols usually show up around 3200-3600, and they can be broad. But since there's a strong band at 1720 cm^-1, that's a carbonyl group. So maybe it's an ester or amide or a ketone or something similar. The 1720 peak is a bit lower than a typical ester (like 1740-1720), but wait, maybe it's an amide? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester because amides usually have lower carbonyl peaks, like around 1650, but I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: Let me list out the peaks.

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That looks like a methyl group attached to something, probably an ethyl group. So maybe a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so it's likely the end of an ethyl chain, like CH2CH3.

Then, 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet suggests exchange with something, perhaps an NH group. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group, but broad could indicate something like an amine. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxygen-bearing group like an ether, but if it's OCH2, the chemical shift might be around 3.5-4.5. But the broadness suggests something exchanging, like an NH in an amide. Wait, but if it's an amide, the NH would typically show up as a broad peak, maybe at around 5-8 ppm, but I'm not certain.

Next peak: 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H—so probably a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group, maybe as part of an ester. For example, in an ethyl ester, the adjacent CH2 to the oxygen would be around 4.1–4.3 usually, but this is at 4.5. Hmm. Or perhaps it's an acetylenic group, but that's probably not the case here.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm, doublet, 2H; 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. So two doublets, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the coupling would be between adjacent protons, but in para substitution, each pair is equivalent. So for example, in p-substituted benzene, you'd have two sets of doublets, maybe at around 7-8.5 ppm depending on substituents. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups because that deshields the protons. So groups like nitro, carbonyl, or perhaps amino (if de-shielded) would cause that.

Putting this together, the molecule likely has a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. The substituents could be an amide group or an ester group or something similar.

Let me look at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Wait, but benzamide is a CONH2 group. If the ethoxy is at position 3, then the substituents would be at positions 3 and 4? Wait, no, benzamide is at position 1, and ethoxy at position 3? Hmm. Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.
