Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and think about what it's asking.

So, the scenario is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots would come into and go out of view, causing brightness variations. The question is saying that this situation can mimic an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve. We're supposed to find what the radius of such a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots, if the star wasn't spotted itself.

Hmm, right. So the key here is to compare the photometric variation caused by the spots to the variation caused by a planet transit. Wait, but wait. When a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the starlight, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, the spots on the star will cause a dip in brightness as they rotate into view, but since they're cooler, they emit less light.

Wait, but the question says that without the spots, the variation would be due to an exoplanet. So the idea is that the brightness change caused by the spots (as seen from Earth) is the same as the change caused by a planet blocking the star's light. So we're to find the planet radius that gives the same amplitude.

But wait, the star's light curve without spots would vary when a planet transits. So the depth of the transit is what we're comparing to the depth caused by the spots.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

When the star has spots, the observed brightness changes as the spots rotate in and out of view. Because spots are cooler, when they are on the visible side, they contribute less to the total flux. So the star's brightness decreases. The same as when a planet transits, which blocks some light.

So the problem is to find the planet radius Rpl such that the dip in brightness is the same as the dip caused by the spots. And we have to calculate Rpl/Rstar.

Wait, but how do spots affect the brightness? Let me model both scenarios.

First, let's model the brightness variation due to the spots. The star has a radius Rstar.
