Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. So, there's a light beam going through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, things get a bit complicated because light's speed isn't just simply additive with velocity like in classical mechanics. Oh wait, but wait, light's speed in a medium depends on the medium's properties. So normally, in a medium with index n, the speed is c/n. But since the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that combine? I think this is a case where I have to consider the frame of reference. The lab frame sees the glass moving, while the glass is at rest in its own frame.

So the light is moving through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. But light's speed in the medium is v_medium = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v. So how does that affect the observed speed of light?

Wait, maybe I should think about this using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when you have velocities in different frames, you can't just add them linearly; you have to use the formula (
