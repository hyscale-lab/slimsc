Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with the Boltzmann equation and Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the number of excited atoms in star_1 is higher. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I need to relate this to the temperatures of the stars.

In LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The formula I remember is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Here, ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this problem, the excitation is the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to the ground state. But the question says that the iron atoms are twice as excited in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1, the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is twice that of star_2.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as r1 = (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) and for star_2 as r2 = (n_upper2)/(n_lower2). According to the problem, r1 = 2 * r2.

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So maybe r1 = 2 r2. Or is it that for each star, the ratio is given, and star_1's ratio is double star_2's? I think that's right.

So according to the Boltzmann equation, for each star, we can write:

r1 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
r2 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Assuming that the statistical weights (g_upper/g_lower) are the same for both stars (since it's the same transition in iron), then the ratio r1/r2 would be exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1))).

Wait,
