Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with the compound 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure, which looks like a bridge structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. So, the starting material has that.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and I think dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. Wait, when I see two equivalents of a di-bromo compound reacting, maybe it's a 1,4-addition or some kind of ring-opening or cycloaddition?

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that molecule has two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons in the cyclohexene. When combined with a base or a nucleophile, maybe there's a Diels-Alder reaction? Or perhaps a ring-opening via elimination.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclic diene. Oh wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction where the bicyclo molecule acts as the diene. Because norbornene derivatives are known dienes for Diels-Alder reactions. So the diene (the bicyclo compound) would react with a dienophile.

But wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Hmm, no, wait, that's a diene itself, so maybe it's acting as a diene in a [4+4] cycloaddition? Or perhaps a different reaction.

Wait, when I think about the substituents, the two dibromomethyl groups could be good leaving groups. So maybe the bicyclo compound (which is a diene) is undergoing a reaction with the cyclohexadiene, which has brominated substituents.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction conditions are with Na
