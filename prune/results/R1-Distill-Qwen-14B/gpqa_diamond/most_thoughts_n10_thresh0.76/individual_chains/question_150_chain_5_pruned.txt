Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. The NMR data is provided, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. The question is about identifying the final product from the options given.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Let's break down the NMR peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H): That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests it's coupling with two neighboring protons. So, maybe it's part of a conjugated system or adjacent to some substituents.

- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted since it's a doublet. The integration is 2H, so maybe two equivalent protons on a benzene ring.

- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H): Another aromatic set, maybe a pair in a para position. Wait, but if the first set was a doublet, perhaps this is part of a di-substituted benzene ring.

- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H): Broad suggests maybe some exchange with protons, like an -OH group, but wait, integration is 2H. Alternatively, it could be vinyl protons adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure yet.

- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H): That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2CH2 group or something similar. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring group.

Putting this together, let's think about possible structures. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or double bond again. Alternatively, could have a benzene and a carbonyl group (which is a double bond), and some other structures.

Looking at the NMR, the aldehyde at 9.72 ppm. So maybe the structure has an aldehyde group. The aromatic regions suggest two benzene rings, perhaps attached to the aldehyde chain.

Wait, the 2H at 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet. Broad signals are often from -OH groups, but 2H suggests maybe two -OHs. Alternatively, vinyl protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system. Or maybe it's part of a di-substituted benzene, but that's more likely to have two doublets.

Another thought: the 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) could be an OCH2CH2 group, perhaps in an alkoxy chain. But wait, the molecular formula has only one oxygen. Let me count: formula is C8H9NO. So one N and one O. So, possible functional groups: an aldehyde (O), and perhaps a nitro group (NO2), but that would require more O's. Wait, no, the formula includes one O.

Alternatively, maybe an amide or something else. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any obvious amide protons. So perhaps the O is in an ether or an alcohol.

Wait, but the reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl. That's typically a diazotization reaction, which is used on aromatic amines to form diazonium salts. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group (-NH2). Because after this step, when you add H2O, maybe it undergoes some hydrolysis.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If it has an NH2 group, that would account for the N. Oh wait, but the formula has one N, so that group would fit. So the starting compound is likely an aromatic amine.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any NH protons. So maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic amine, where the NH2 is in a position that's not easily seen, or perhaps it's in a ring, like aniline. But in the NMR, I don't see any peaks around 4-5 ppm which often correspond to NH protons. Hmm, maybe the NH2 is in a position where the protons are exchanging rapidly, leading to a broad peak that's not easily noticeable, or perhaps it's deprotonated? Or maybe the sample was taken in D2O, which can cause exchange and not show NH signals. Alternatively, maybe the amine is in a conjugated system, making the NH protons broad or not appearing.

Alternatively, perhaps the N is part of a ring, like a pyridine or something else, but that seems less likely given the formula and NMR.

Wait, let's think about the reaction steps. After diazotization with NaNO2 and HCl, the next step is H2O. Then aqueous KOH and heat. Diazonium salts in water can undergo various reactions, like hydrolysis. For example, if the diazonium salt is from an aniline, it can undergo hydrolysis to form a phenol. So maybe the starting compound is an aniline derivative, which after diazotization and hydrolysis becomes a phenol.

So, the starting compound is an aniline (Ar-NH2) connected to some other structure, which upon diazotization and hydrolysis would form a phenol group.

Now, looking back at the NMR. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde
