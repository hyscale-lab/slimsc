Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving different v_rel and E values.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u and v are velocities of the two objects in the same frame. Wait, but wait—wait, I'm getting confused. Let's see: the astronauts are moving in the same direction. So if I want to find the relative speed of one as seen from the other, I need to use the formula correctly.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: if astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So in the frame where the space is at rest, A is moving faster than B. But when we want to find the speed of A as seen from B, or vice versa, we have to use the formula for relative velocity.

Wait no, actually, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So if A is moving at u = 0.6c and B at v = 0.5c, then from B's frame, A's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed would be (0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that would narrow it down to those two.

Now for the total energy. Hmm, I think I need to calculate the relativistic energies for both astronauts and then sum them. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, for the astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Let me compute gamma for that. v = 0.6c, so v²/c² = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of that is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Next, the other astronaut has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Let's find gamma. v²/c² is 0.25, so 1 -0.25 = 0.75. Square root is sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and option D says E=5 mc². So that's a match for option C.

So putting it all together: the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So option C is the one.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

The numerator is:

\[
0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c
\]

The denominator is:

\[
1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus, the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

This matches the relative speed given in options C and D.

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the astronaut with mass \( 2m \) and speed \( 0.6c \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

The energy is:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the astronaut with mass \( 3m \) and speed \( 0.5c \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

The energy is:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

This matches the total energy given in option C. Combining the relative speed and total energy, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
