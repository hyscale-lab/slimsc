Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I'm given the molecular weights: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that orthophosphate is HPO4^2-. But wait, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH—like H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The problem is probably about finding the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution.

I think I should start by calculating the number of moles of each substance. Because both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O are phosphates, their moles will contribute to the total phosphate in solution.

First, moles of KH2PO4. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.00734 moles. Wait, let me do exact calculation:

1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Next, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O. So mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 177.99. So 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O is the same as Na2HPO4 plus two water molecules. Does that affect the moles of HPO4^2-? I don't think so, because each formula unit of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one HPO4^2- ion. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So total moles of HPO4^2- from both sources would be the sum of the moles from each compound. Because KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (I think). Wait wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). So when it dissociates, it gives K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Similarly,
