Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on black hole thermodynamics, but I'll try to remember the key points.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy. The options are A to D, all in the 10^50 to 10^66 range. 

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So I need to find the area A.

The area A is related to the radius of the event horizon. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by R_s = 2 G M / c², where M is the mass of the black hole. The area A is 4 π R_s².

But wait, how do I find R_s from the given angular size θ and distance d? Oh right, angular size θ in radians is approximately equal to the ratio of the size (like diameter) over the distance. So θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d. Wait, no, wait. The formula for angular size is θ (in radians) ≈ diameter / distance. But since θ is small, we can use θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d. So R_s = (θ * d) / 2.

Wait, that makes sense because θ is the angle, but for small angles, the opposite side is approximately the arc length, which is R_s, and the adjacent is d. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Schwarzschild radius is the radius of the event horizon. So the diameter would be 2 R_s. So the angular size θ in radians is approximately diameter over distance, so θ ≈ 2 R_s / d. So R_s ≈ (θ * d) / 2.

But wait, θ is given in degrees. So I need to convert that to radians first. Because all the formulas in physics use radians. How do I convert 10^-17 degrees to radians? Since 180 degrees is π radians
