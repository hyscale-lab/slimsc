Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The first planet caused a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift in a spectral line. The second caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula I think is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Oh right, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e^2)^(0.5)) )) )

But wait, since the planet masses are similar to Neptune's, which is much smaller than the star's mass (Sun-like), M_planet is negligible compared to M_star. So the formula simplifies. Let me see, the simplified version is K â‰ˆ (v) is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / P) )^(1/3) ? Or wait, maybe I got that mixed up.

Wait, the key point is that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (8 * c^3 * lambda) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

But since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies. Alternatively, I've heard that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P * sin i)) )^(1/3) ), but maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, another approach: since both planets have similar masses and the stars have the same mass, the ratio
