Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The problem says that the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I guess I need to find the eigenvector for when P acting on it gives that value.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Right, because the operator P is a vector operator, so it can be expressed as P = Px x-hat + Py y-hat + Pz z-hat. But wait, the direction is along n, which is in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n would have components (x, 0, z), because it's in x-z plane, so y-component is zero.

So the operator along direction n would be P·n, right? Because the operator in the direction of n is the component of P along n. So that's (P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z) times the unit vector, I think. Wait, but wait, more accurately, the operator P in direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) is given by n ⋅ P, which is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is 0. So the operator becomes n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the operator we're interested in is Pn = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. And we need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of Pn should be ±ħ/2, because each component (Px, Py, Pz) has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, I think. So the eigenvectors would correspond to the spin-up or spin-down along direction n.

Hmm, but what's the form of the eigenvectors for Pn? Well, perhaps it's easier to write the matrix for Pn and then find its eigenvectors.

Wait, first, let's get the matrices for each component.

Given:

P_x is (
