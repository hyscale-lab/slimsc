Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should choose that one. Let's see what the problem gives me.

So, both planets are Earth-like, and they've been detected via the RV method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Specifically, Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. 

Wait, but for transits, the orbital period affects how often they can transit. But the transit probability isn't directly the same as the period, though. I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit relative to our viewing angle.

They also mention that both have circular orbits. That simplifies things a bit because eccentricity doesn't play a role here.

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But interestingly, both stars have the same radius. Hmm, so even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not larger in radius. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. More massive stars usually have larger radii, but in this case, they're the same. Maybe they're similar in radius because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, so perhaps it's in a stage where it hasn't expanded much yet. But whatever, their radii are the same.

The key factors for transit probability are the size of the star and the size of the planet relative to the orbital distance. The formula I remember for the probability is something like (R_p / a) * (something else?), but I think the main factors are the planet's size, the star's size, and the orbital distance.

Wait, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a) * (R_star / a), but wait, actually, the probability is proportional to (R_p + R_star) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly (R_p / a) * (something else). Or wait, no. Actually, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbital plane. Hmm, I might be mixing things up.

Let me think again. The probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula:

Probability ≈ (R_p + R_s) / a,

where R_p is the planet's radius, R_s is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, R_p + R_s ≈ R_s. So the probability is roughly (R_s) / a.

But wait, no, that's not right. The actual formula for the probability is (2 * R_s) / a. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star. The area where the planet can be in line is a circle with diameter 2R_s, so the probability is (2 R_s) / (a), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think it's more about the orbital distance compared to the star's size. The transit probability is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet << R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. But wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the ratio between the size of the star and the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, but considering the orbital distance. The formula I remember is:

P ≈ (R_s) / a

But no, I think that's not quite accurate. Another thought: the transit occurs when the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on relative to us. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital distance. So the chance is proportional to (R_s / a) multiplied by the fraction of the orbit where the planet is in front of the star.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is P ≈ (R_p + R_s) / a. But since R_p is much smaller, it's approximately (R_s) / a. So the probability is proportional to R_s / a.

Wait, but another source I recall says that the transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (something else), perhaps the density or the inclination. But inclination is something else, but in this problem, the question is about the probability, which depends on the geometry, so perhaps inclination is a separate factor and for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the planets have the same inclination distribution, which would mean that the transit probability depends only on R_s and a.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. The probability is given by (R_*/ a) * (1 + (R_p/R_*) ), but again, because R_p is much smaller, it's approximately (R_*)/(a). So P ∝ R_*/a.

Wait, but wait. No, I think the actual formula is P = (R_*/a) * (1/(1 - e²)^0.5), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that factor is 1. So P ∝ R_*/a.

But wait, another thought: the probability that a planet transits is the fraction of its orbit where it is in front of the star. Since the planet's orbit is circular, the probability is given by the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital distance. So:

P ≈ (2 R_*) / (2a) )? Or wait, no. Because the planet's orbital plane has a certain size, and the chance that it passes in front is when the planet's path crosses our line of sight. The formula is:

P = (R_* + R_p) / a

But since R_p << R_*, it's approximately R_* / a.

So for each planet, the probability is proportional to R_* / a.

Wait, but the question says that both host stars have the same radius. So R_*1 = R_*2 = R.

So, the probability for each planet is (R/a1) and (R/a2), respectively.

Therefore, P1 ∝ 1/a1, P2 ∝ 1/a2.

So which planet has a smaller a?

Wait, Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the star's mass M. The formula is P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ * (4π² a³)/(G M). So P² = (4 π² a³) / (G M). Wait, the exact formula is P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M), where M is the star's mass.

So for each planet, their a can be determined based on their period and the star's mass.

Given that both planets have known periods. Let me write down the details.

Planet_1: period P1 = P2 / 3. Because "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2."

Star_1 mass M1 = 2 * M2, since "the star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2."

Both have circular orbits, so a^3 ∝ P² * M.

So for Planet_1, a1^3 = (G M1) (P1²)/(4 π²). Similarly for Planet_2, a2^3 = (G M2) (P2²)/(4 π²).

But since both have the same G and 4π², we can write:

a1^3 = (M1) (P1²)
a2^3 = (M2) (P2²)

But a1 and a2 are in different units, but since we are looking for the ratio, let's compute a1/a2.

Let me compute a1 in terms of a2.

We know that M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = (1/3) P2.

So a1^3 = M1 P1² = (2 M2) * ( (P2/3) )² = 2 M2 * P2² /9 = (2/9) M2 P2².

But a2^3 = M2 P2².

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

Thus, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3): 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approx 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but how does the transit probability compare?

Earlier, we thought P ∝ R_*/a. Since both stars have the same R, the probability is P1 = R / a1, P2 = R / a2.

So P1 / P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 = 0.606 a2,

a2 / a1 = 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, that suggests that Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times, which seems higher. What did I miss?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

We have a1^3 = (2 M2) * (P1^2) = 2 M2 * (P2^2/9) = (2/9) M2 P2^2.

a2^3 = M2 P2^2.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) M2 P2^2 / (M2 P2^2) ) = 2/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3):

Let me compute it more accurately.

2/9 = 0.222222...

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So P1 = R / a1 = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R / a2) ) = approx 1.65 * (R/a2).

P2 = R/a2.

So P1 = 1.65 P2.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

Which means, Planet_1 is more likely to transit. So the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D is 2.7 times, which is higher than what I calculated.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the formula? Let me think again about the transit probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the transit probability is (R_p + R_*)² / a².

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Wait, the transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star. The area of the star is π R_*². The area of the 'target' area from which the planet can transit is π (R_* + R_p)^2. So the probability is the ratio of the planet's cross-section to the star's cross-section, but I think that's not the case because the planet's orbital distance is much larger than the star's size.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me recall the correct formula.

The transit probability is given by:

P = (R_* + R_p) / a,

where R_* is the star's radius, R_p the planet's radius, and a the semi-major axis.

But since R_p << R_*, this simplifies to P ≈ R_* / a.

But wait, is it (R_* + R_p) or 2 R_* or something else?

Actually, I think the correct formula is:

P = (R_* / a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^0.5 )

But since e=0 for both, it's just R_* / a.

So my original approach holds. So back to that.

So with that, the probability is higher for Planet_1.

So the correct answer is option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but what if the transit probability formula is (R_* / a) * (something else)?

Another thought: the transit probability is actually the fraction of the orbit where the planet is in the line of sight. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_*/a) * (1/(1 - e^2))^0.5 ), but e=0, so it's just R_*/a.

But I'm confident now that the calculation is correct.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given information and apply the formula for transit probability. The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's Third Law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M \) is the mass of the host star, we can relate the semi-major axes of the two planets. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1's period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (three times shorter than Planet_2's period).
- Planet_1's host star mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (twice the mass of Planet_2's host star).

From Kepler's Third Law:
\[
a_1^3 \propto M_1 P_1^2 = (2M_2) \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2
\]
\[
a_2^3 \propto M_2 P_2^2
\]
Taking the ratio:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{\frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606 a_2} \approx 1.65
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion
The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability (~1.65 times) compared to Planet_2. This matches option C.
