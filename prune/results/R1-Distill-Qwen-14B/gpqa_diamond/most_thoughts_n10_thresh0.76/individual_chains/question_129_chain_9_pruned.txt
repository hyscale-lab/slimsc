Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions leading from compound A to E. There are also some hints provided, and we're given four options to choose from. Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are about the structure of compound A and the IR spectra of A and E. Let's look at the hints.

Hint a says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ylides, but I remember that they are typically used in alkylation reactions, especially in the formation of rings, like in the formation of epoxides or in some cyclopropanation reactions. Wait, but more importantly, I think that when a carbonyl group reacts with a ylide, like in the case of the Wittig reaction, the carbonyl is converted into an alkene. Oh right! The Wittig reaction involves a ylide reacting with a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde) to form an alkene.

So if reacting A with a phosphorus ylide gives that cyclopentane compound, that suggests that A contains a carbonyl group which is being converted into an alkene via a Wittig reaction. So A must be a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. The product after the Wittig is a cyclopentane with substituents. Let me visualize that structure.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The substituents are methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is like a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the cyclopentane ring. So the cyclopentane ring has a double bond (the ylidene part) connected via position 4.

Let me think: when a Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with a ketone, it forms an alkene. So the starting ketone would have been in a position where the ylide can attack.

Wait, perhaps the structure of A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Because cyclopentanone has a ketone group. So if compound A is a cyclopentanone, and upon Wittig reaction, it would form a cyclopentane with an adjacent double bond.

Wait, but the product after Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has a double bond as part of the substituent. So perhaps the starting material A is a cyclopentanone with substituents that, after the Wittig, would form the structure described.

Wait, maybe the carbonyl in A is at position 4 of the cyclopentane ring. Because the Wittig would attack the carbonyl, converting it into a double bond. So in the product, the position where the carbonyl was becomes a CH2 group, and the adjacent positions get the substituents from the ylide.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentane ring in the product comes from the Wittig attacking a ketone that was part of a larger ring. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to imagine the reaction.

Another approach: The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the cyclopentane
