Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He did serial dilutions and ran three technical replicates each. The efficiency was 100%, R2 is 1, which means the curve is perfect. The slope is -3.3. Wait, what does the slope mean again? Oh right, in qPCR, the slope of the standard curve is used to calculate the efficiency. The formula is Efficiency = 10^(-1/slope). So here, 10^(-1/(-3.3)) = 10^(0.303) ≈ 2. So a slope of -3.3 would imply 100% efficiency because 2^(-1) is 0.5, but wait, no. Wait, the efficiency is calculated as 100% when the slope is -3.32193, right? Because for a 100% efficient PCR, each cycle doubles the DNA. So the formula would be log2(copy number) = slope * Ct + intercept. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh, right, the standard curve equation is usually Ct = slope * log(target) + intercept. Wait, no, I think I get confused. Let me think: when the target amount increases, the Ct should decrease because you reach the threshold sooner. So in the equation, Ct = (slope) * log(copy number) + intercept. Wait, that's not right because higher copy numbers would mean lower Ct. So if the copy number is increasing, log would be increasing, so if Ct is decreasing, the slope should be negative. So the equation is Ct = (negative slope) * log(copy number) + intercept. So yeah, the slope is negative.

In this case, the slope is -3.3. So for each tenfold increase in target, how much does Ct change? Because a tenfold increase in target would be a log10 change of 1. So the change in Ct would be slope * 1. So -3.3, which means a decrease of 3.3 cycles per tenfold increase. Wait, but the data shows more than that.

Looking at the data: when the copies go from 100000 to 10000 (tenfold dilution), the Ct goes from about 34 to 31. So the difference is 3.0 cycles. Similarly, from 10000 to 1000, Ct goes from ~31 to 27.3, which is a change of about 3.7 cycles. Hmm, wait, that's more than the expected 3.3 cycles. Hmm, but the efficiency is 100%, so each cycle should double the product. Wait, a tenfold dilution should require about 3.32 cycles more to reach the same Ct, right? Because 2^3.32 ≈ 10. So if you have a tenfold higher concentration, the Ct should be 3.32 cycles lower.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. The first sample is 100000 copies, Ct ~34. The next is 10000, which is a tenfold lower concentration, so the Ct should be about 3.32 cycles higher. So 34 + 3.32 is around 37.32. But in the data, the Ct at 10000 is 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Wait, that's lower than 34. Oh wait, no, higher concentration should have lower Ct. Oh right, because more starting material reaches the threshold sooner. So when you dilute, you have fewer copies, so Ct increases. So from 100000 to 10000 (tenfold
