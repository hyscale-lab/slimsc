Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I remember that in fission, a heavy nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of energy. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact calculations, so let me try to think this through.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh wait, so let me note that down.

So, initial mass is M, rest mass energy E_initial = 300 GeV.

After fission, two fragments: let's call their rest masses m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2 m2. So m1 is more massive than m2.

And m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because the sum is 99% of M.

Wait, M is the initial mass. So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum: 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, no, because 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M /3 → which is 0.33 M each? Wait, no, 0.99 M divided by 3 is 0.33 M? Wait, 0.99/3 is 0.33, yes. So m2 is 0.33 M, m1 is 0.66 M.

But wait, the sum is 0.99 M. So M_initial is larger than the sum of the two fragments. So the mass difference must be the mass converted into energy, right? So the mass defect is delta m = M - (m1 + m2) = M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M.

So the energy released would be delta E = delta m c². But since E_initial is given as 300 GeV, which is M c², right? Because rest mass energy is Mc². So E_initial = M c
