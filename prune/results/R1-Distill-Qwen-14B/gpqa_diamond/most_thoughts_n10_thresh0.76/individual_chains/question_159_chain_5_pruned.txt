Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at around 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. Hmm, I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and sometimes in the optical or near-infrared. But wait, what's the context here? Oh right, it's about the flux dropping at shorter wavelengths, which I think is related to the Lyman break. Oh wait, the Lyman series is for hydrogen, right? The Lyman break is when the continuum drops because of absorption by neutral hydrogen. Lyman series is in the UV, but if the quasar's emission is being observed in the optical and near-IR, maybe it's redshifted.

So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is near-infrared, but the flux drops below that, perhaps the Lyman limit is at 912 Angstroms (which is 91.2 nm), so when that's redshifted beyond the observed wavelength, it would cause a drop in flux. Wait, but wait, the observed peak is 790 nm, which is in the near IR. Let me think.

Wait, the Lyman series has transitions ending at n=1, so the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So if the quasar's rest frame emission line is at 121.6 nm, but when observed, the wavelength is longer because of redshift. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm,
