Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The question is about a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, which probably simplifies things a bit. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when a particle at rest decays, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the decay products should cancel each other out. That means the magnitudes of their momenta are equal but opposite. But since I'm looking for kinetic energy, I probably need to use conservation of energy and momentum.

The given particles are Pi(+) which decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, and mu is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino? I think neutrinos are almost massless, so their rest mass is negligible. So I can approximate the neutrino's mass as zero. That should make the calculations easier.

So, the decay equation is π+ → μ+ + ν. The π is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After decay, the momentum vectors of μ and ν must be equal and opposite. So their magnitudes are the same.

Let me denote the kinetic energies as K_mu and K_nu. But wait, neutrino's kinetic energy would be its total energy because its rest mass is negligible. So E_nu ≈ p_nu * c, where p is the magnitude of momentum.

For the muon, its total energy is its rest energy plus kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy: E_initial = m_pi c².

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's and neutrino's energies. So:

m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu
m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + (p_nu c)

But because of conservation of momentum, p_mu = p_nu. So E_nu = p_mu c. And since E_mu² = (p_mu c)² c² + (m_mu c²)². Wait, that's the relativistic energy equation.

Hmm,
