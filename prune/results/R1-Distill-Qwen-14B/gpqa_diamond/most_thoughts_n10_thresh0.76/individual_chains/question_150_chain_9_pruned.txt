Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO, C is 8, H is 9, X is 0 (assuming no halogens), N is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (3 DoU), a double bond (1), and an amine or something else (another 1? Or another ring? Not sure yet.)

The NMR data is given. Let me look at that. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Breaking down the NMR:

- 9.72 ppm triplet (t, 1H): That's a high chemical shift. Aldehydic protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe an aldehyde group. But it's a triplet, which is interesting because aldehydes are typically split into doublets or singlets depending on neighboring protons. Wait, but maybe it's adjacent to something else. Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system?

- 6.98 (d, 2H): This looks like aromatic protons. A doublet suggests they're attached to adjacent carbons, perhaps para-substituted rings. Since it's 2H, maybe two equivalent protons in a para position.

- 6.51 (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons. Also a doublet. Could this be another aromatic ring with substituents? Or perhaps part of a conjugated system. For example, maybe an ortho or para substitution.

- 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet. Two protons. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group nearby. Or an aromatic ring with some substituent causing broadening. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl proton in a conjugated system, like adjacent to an oxygen.

- 3.66 (d, 2H): This is around the region for CH2 groups attached to oxygen, like OCH2. The doublet suggests each of the two protons is next to one another on adjacent carbons. So maybe an -O-CH2-CH2- group? Or perhaps a CH2 attached to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Putting this together, let's think about the structure. The presence of an aldehyde (9.72 ppm) suggests the molecule has a formyl group. The two aromatic systems (from 6.98 and 6.51) might mean two benzene rings attached to the molecule. Wait, but how? Maybe each benzene ring is attached to a carbon chain that includes the aldehyde group.

Wait, another thought: The molecular formula C8H9NO has 8 carbons. Let's count. A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so if there are two benzene rings, that's 12, which is more than 8. So that can't be. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the formula is C8H9NO. So it's 8 carbons in total. So if there's a benzene ring (6 carbons), that leaves 2 more. So perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring and two other carbons.

Wait, but the NMR shows two sets of aromatic protons, so maybe two benzene rings? Hmm, but that would require 12 carbons, which is more than the 8 we have. So I must be thinking wrong. Maybe it's a single benzene ring but with substituents that have additional aromatic systems or maybe not. Wait, another thought: Maybe the NMR peaks for the aromatic regions are from different substituents on the same ring. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring and another aromatic fragment, but that doesn't make much sense. Or maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with two different substituents each contributing to the aromatic protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't a benzene ring but another type of ring, like a furan or something else. But furan protons are usually around 6.5-7.5 ppm, which fits. However, the molecular formula C8H9NO: if it's a furan, that's five-membered, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the molecule is a substituted benzaldehyde. Let's think: a benzaldehyde would have the formula C7H6O. But our compound is C8H9NO, which is one more carbon (maybe a substituent?), plus N. So perhaps a benzaldehyde with a side chain that includes an amine or other group.

Wait, the molecular formula includes an N. So maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde with an amine substituent or an oxygen-based substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with an amine substituent.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure. Suppose we have a benzene ring with substituents. One substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO), which explains the 9.72 peak. Another substituent might be a CH2- group attached to something else.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm peak (d, 2H): OCH2 could be part of an ether or something. But perhaps it's attached to an oxygen, like a methylene group next to an oxygen. So maybe the structure is something like OCH2CH2... attached to the benzene.

Wait, but molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons. Benzene (6 C) + CHO (1 C) + OCH2 (another 2 C? No, OCH2 is part of a chain.) Wait, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a CH2 group attached to another part.

Let me think about the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 is a 1H. That's the aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons usually don't have neighboring protons because they're at the end. So a triplet would imply that the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group. Hmm, maybe it's a propargyl aldehyde or something. Wait, no, that's triple bond. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond.

Wait, for the aldehyde proton to be a triplet, it must be adjacent to a CH2 group that's split into a triplet. So the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2 group. So maybe the structure is like R-CH2-CHO. Then the aldehyde proton would be next to a CH2, which would split it into a triplet. So that would explain the 9.72 triplet.

So the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2 group. Then, the 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be the CH2-O, perhaps connected to another part of the molecule.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a d (doublet) with 2H. So each H is next to another H on the adjacent carbon. So maybe it's a CH2 connected to another CH2, but that's for a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like O-CH2-CH2-O or something, but I'm not sure.

Another peak in the NMR is 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet. Two protons. Maybe these are aromatic protons, but perhaps in a para-substituted ring, or maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, they could be part of a conjugated
