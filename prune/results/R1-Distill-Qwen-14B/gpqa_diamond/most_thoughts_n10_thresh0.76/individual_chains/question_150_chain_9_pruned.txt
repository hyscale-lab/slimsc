Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about the possible degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. So, the degrees of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Oh wait, right, the formula is C8H9NO. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Let's plug the numbers in.

DOU = (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2. Wait, because O is a heteroatom, but for DOU I think it's (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is halogens, which there are none here. So, DOU = (18 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That can be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring, which is 4 DOU (three double bonds, but since it's a ring, each contributes one). So that leaves one more DOU. Which could be a double bond or a ring. So maybe a double bond elsewhere.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet, 1H. High ppm like 9.7 suggests an aldehyde proton, maybe? Or something deshielded like an acidic proton. If it's an aldehyde, that would be an aldehyde group. But wait, the triplet? Aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they don't have neighboring protons. Hmm, unless it's part of some coupling... Wait, maybe it's an enol or something else? Or maybe a conjugated system.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) – these look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 is probably the protons ortho to substituents, and 6.51 could be para or meta. Wait, but 6.98 is more downfield than 6.51, which suggests maybe the 6.98 is para to an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro or something else. Or perhaps it's part of a substituted benzene ring.
