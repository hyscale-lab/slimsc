Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each. Then, I'll choose the correct option from A to D.

First reaction:
1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH (which I think is potassium hydride), and then H+ to give product A.

Second reaction:
(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacts with acetyl bromide (which is CH3COBr) in the presence of a base, LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), to give product B.

I need to figure out what A and B are. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction 1:

The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which is the spiro atom here. The structure of spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol would have a five-membered ring and a three-membered ring connected at the first carbon. But wait, non is nine carbons, so maybe the rings are 3 and 5 carbons each? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on spiro compounds, but I'll try to visualize it.

The starting alcohol is 1-vinyl, meaning there's a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the spiro carbon, which is the first carbon. So the structure has a spiro system, and the alcohol is on the same carbon as the vinyl group.

The reagents are THF (a solvent, probably for the reaction), KH (a strong base, which is potassium hydride, a deprotonating agent), then H+ is added, which suggests an acid workup.

So, what happens when a cyclic enol ether is treated with a strong base like KH? Wait, wait, the starting material is an enol. Wait, no. The starting material is a spiro compound with an alcohol and a double bond. So maybe it's an enol ether? Or perhaps it's a conjugated dienol or something else.

Wait, wait. The structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro system has two rings: a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring. The 5-en-1-ol part suggests a double bond at position 5 and an alcohol at position 1. The 1-vinyl group is attached to the spiro carbon, which is position 1.

When an alcohol is treated with a strong base like KH, I think it deprotonates to form an alkoxide. But wait, in THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions. Then, when H+ is added, perhaps it's an acid workup, maybe to protonate something.

But wait, another possibility: when you have a dienol or an enol, and you deprotonate, you can form a conjugate base, which could lead to some
