Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Okay, let's start reading through the question carefully and try to unpack each part.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Five of these compounds are known. Let me break down the information given for each compound.

First, substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine gas. The oF of A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, oF usually stands for oxygen fugacity or something else? Wait, no, maybe it's the oxidation state of fluorine? Or perhaps it's the oxygen-free energy? Wait, I think in this context, oF might represent the oxidation number of fluorine in the compound. Because when fluorine is in a compound, it usually has a negative charge. But wait, fluorine is more electronegative, so it tends to have a negative oxidation state. So if A2 has oF of 31.96%, that might mean that the oxidation state is around -1.333? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, maybe oF is the oxygen or fluorine content, but that's not making sense here. Alternatively, perhaps it's the percentage of fluorine by mass? So in A2, fluorine makes up 31.96% by mass.

Wait, that makes more sense. So A2 is a compound where F is 31.96% by mass. Let's calculate the molar mass of A2 based on that. Let's think: suppose the formula is YF_x. The mass of F is 31.96% of the total. So (x * 19)/(M) = 0.3196, where M is the molar mass of A2, which is Y's atomic weight plus x *19.

Wait, but I don't know what Y is yet. Let me think. The problem says there are five binary compounds of fluorine with Y. So Y is some element that forms five different fluorides. Common elements with multiple fluorides include carbon (CF4, CF3Cl, etc.—no, wait, carbon has only a few, maybe more). Or perhaps nitrogen? Or maybe something else. Maybe Y is a Group 17 element? Hmm, not sure yet.

But let's go back. A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So A1 → A2 + F2. Wait, no, because fluorine is a diatomic molecule, so the reaction would be A1 → A2 + F2. But wait, A1 is a compound, so perhaps it's a polyatomic fluoride that breaks down into another fluoride and F2. For example, maybe A1 is a higher fluoride which splits into a lower one and releases F2.

Wait, but let's think about the fluorine percentages. If A2 has F at 31.96%, let's calculate what that implies for the formula. Let's say A2 is YF_x. So the mass of F is x * 19 g/mol. The molar mass of A2 is Y + 19x. So (19
