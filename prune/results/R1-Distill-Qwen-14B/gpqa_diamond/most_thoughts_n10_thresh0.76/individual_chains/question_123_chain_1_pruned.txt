Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a supernova in our Galaxy. Part of the ejecta is moving towards the center. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, so there's no acceleration involved. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play. Oh wait, but in this case, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me think about how that compares to the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light, or 20% of c. That's a significant fraction, so relativistic effects might matter here.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So it's a question of time dilation and length contraction, perhaps? No, wait, maybe it's more straightforward. Let me think about the frames involved.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at a certain velocity. Let me denote the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame as v. But according to the problem, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that's the relative velocity between the two frames.

Wait, but the two frames are moving towards each other. So the velocity u of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is the same as the velocity of the Galaxy in the ejecta frame, but opposite in direction. Because if the Galaxy is moving at u towards the ejecta, then from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at u, so the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy moves towards it at u. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at u towards the Galaxy.

Wait, no, maybe that's getting confused. Let me think of it more carefully. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at
