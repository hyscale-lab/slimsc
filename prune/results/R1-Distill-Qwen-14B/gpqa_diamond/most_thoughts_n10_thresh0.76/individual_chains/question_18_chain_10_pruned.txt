Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll think through it step by step.

First, I'll read the question again to make sure I get all the details right. The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, the masses might not be directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances. So maybe I can skip that part, unless it affects the method used, but the problem says to assume LTE and use the EW method, so perhaps mass isn't a factor in the calculation itself.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2.

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. That means nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5. So nMg/nH = 10^-5 ≈ 1e-5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The notation is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Or is it? Oh, right, the standard notation is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - [X/Y]_sun. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me double-check. Oh no, [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log (nX/nY / nX_sun/nY_sun) ) = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) ). So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means for Star_1, the ratio Fe/H is the same as in the Sun. Similarly for [Mg/H]_2 being 0. So let me process that.

So for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun → so nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun. Which means [Fe/H] is 0, which matches the given.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg/nH is same as Sun for Star_2.

Wait, but for the other abundances:
Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Which is log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3. So nSi/nFe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

And Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0.3 → nMg/nSi in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

The question asks for the ratio of
