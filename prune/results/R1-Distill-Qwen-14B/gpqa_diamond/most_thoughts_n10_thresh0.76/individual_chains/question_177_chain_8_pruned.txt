Okay, so I have this problem about two stars and their luminosities. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, okay, so the question gives me some information about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me jot down the key points.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. But wait, the problem is about luminosity, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here. I remember that for stars, luminosity relates to radius and temperature, not mass directly, unless we're considering other factors like the mass-luminosity relation. But the question says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so I think I can ignore the mass for the luminosity calculation unless it affects the temperature somehow.

The spectroscopy part says the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9e-3 m·K) and T is the temperature. If both λ_max are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. Wait, no, because λ_max is the same, so T1 = T2. So they have the same temperature. That's an important point.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right, the Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength λ' = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, that's the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, it's approximately λ' ≈ λ0 (1 + v_r / c), but I'm not sure which one to use here. Wait, but wait a second, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps this is the observed wavelength, which would be different from their rest wavelengths.

Wait, but the calculation of luminosity as a black
