Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question gives me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance from the options provided.

Wait, what's the mean decay distance again? Oh right, it's the average distance a particle travels before decaying. I remember that the mean lifetime is related to the decay width, and then using that to find the distance.

The formula for the mean lifetime τ is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the total decay width. Oh, but wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has to be in compatible units. So I'll need to convert everything properly.

First, let's write down the known constants. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh, right, because ħ is about 197 MeV·fm, but maybe it's easier to use the GeV version here.

So Γ is 320 MeV, but wait E_X is in GeV. Oh, but actually, Γ is given as 320 MeV, so I should convert that to GeV for consistency. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = let's compute that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.

Let me calculate that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ is approximately 2.057e-24 seconds.

But wait, that's the lifetime. Now, how about the decay distance? The mean decay distance (L) is given by L = v * τ, where v is the velocity of the particle.

Hmm, I need to find the velocity. The particle is a meson, so it's a composite of quarks, but to find its velocity, I can use the energy and mass.

Energy E is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E = gamma * m c². Since E is given, and m is 1.2 GeV/c², perhaps I can find the gamma factor.

Wait, wait. E = gamma * m c². So gamma = E / (m c²). But since E and m are both in GeV units, and c is the speed of light, but when using units where c=1, E (GeV) = gamma * m (GeV/c²) * c². So in natural units, E = gamma * m. So gamma = E / m.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is 6.6667. Gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can solve for v/c.

Let me rearrange that. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) → sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/gamma → 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So substituting gamma=6.6667, which is 20/3. Let's compute 1/gamma^2: (1/(20/3))² = (3/20)^2 = 9/400=0.0225.

So v²/c² = 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. So v = sqrt(0.9775) * c ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let me approximate that. 0.9887^2 is about (0.98^2 is 0.9604, 0.988^2: 0.988*0.988 = (0.98 +0.008)^2) = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064= ~0.976144. Hmm, but 0.9887 squared is about 0.9775? Let me double-check. 0.9887^2 = ?

0.9887 * 0.9887: Let me compute 0.98^2=0.9604. Then 0.0087^2≈0.00007569. The cross terms: 2*(0.98)(0.0087)=2*0.008526=0.017052. So total is approximately 0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569 = 0.9775. Yes, so v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So the velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light. But maybe I can be more precise. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the exact expression without approximating too early.

But maybe I should proceed with the approximation for now. So v≈0.9887c.

Now, the distance L is velocity multiplied by the lifetime τ.

So L = v * τ.

v is 0.9887c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, but let me compute v in m/s. c is approx 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

τ is 2.057e-24 seconds.

So L ≈ (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.057e-24 s) = let's compute that.

2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = let's calculate the exponent: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.966 * 2.057 ≈ approximately 6.098.

So L ≈ 6.098e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, that's about 6e-16 meters. But looking at the options, they are in 1e-15 or 1e-16.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C) 5.0223e-15 m

D) 4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, my calculation got about 6e-16 meters, but none of the options is exactly that. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the velocity. Let me re-express gamma and velocity more accurately.

Wait, another approach: for high-energy particles, gamma is much larger than 1, but in this case, gamma is about 6.6667, which is manageable.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta (β = v/c) more accurately using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Wait, 1/gamma^2 is 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = (1.2/8)^2 → (3/20)^2=9/400=0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. So β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So previous calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime. Wait, the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute that again.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32: 0.32 = 32e-2.

So 6.582e-25 / 32e-2 = (6.582/32) * 1e-23.

6.582 /32 is approximately 0.2056875.

So τ ≈ 0.2056875e-23 s = 2.056875e-24 s. So that part is correct.

So L = v * τ = beta * c * tau.

So, beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.10e-16 m.

But the options don't have anything near 6e-16. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, wait! The decay width is Γ, which is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma. But wait, in particle physics, the total width Γ is related to the lifetime by Gamma = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma. So that's
