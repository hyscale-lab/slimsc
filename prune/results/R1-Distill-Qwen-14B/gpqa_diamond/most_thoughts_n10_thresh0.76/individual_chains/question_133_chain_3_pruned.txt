Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, I think. Wait, no, orthophosphate is actually H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates into different forms. Wait, wait, the phosphate ion can exist in different forms depending on the pH. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can lose three protons. So the species in solution could be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate usually refers to H3PO4, but sometimes it might refer to HPO4^2-? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh wait, in this context, the orthophosphate ion is probably HPO4^2- because when you have Na2HPO4, that's the sodium salt of HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, wait. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- (so the hydrogen phosphate ion). Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (the dihydrate), which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Oh, right! So in this solution, we have
