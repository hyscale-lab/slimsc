Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Michael addition question. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, which then tautomerizes or something.

Looking at the problem, there are three reactions and three products: A, B, and C. The question gives me some starting materials and conditions, and I have to match them with the options provided.

Let me take them one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, NaOEt is a strong base, probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester with two ester groups. The structure of dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. It's a malonate ester, which is a good nucleophile for the Michael reaction because it can form an enolate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. Wait, no, wait. Structure is CH2-CH2-CO2Me, but with a substituent. Wait, no. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, but in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be CH2CH2... wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOMe, but 3-(p-tolyl) would mean that the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Or perhaps it's another arrangement. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize it.

Wait, the starting
