Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I remember that optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, specifically when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light because of its asymmetrical structure. But let me think through each option carefully.

The question lists four compounds: 1, 2, 3, 4. And the options are combinations of these. Let me go one by one.

Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, okay, so biphenyl rings connected with substituents. The structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and each has a nitro group at 6 and 6'. Wait, but the substituents are at 2 and 2', so both are on the same side of their respective rings? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, so what's the structure here. The main chain is a biphenyl, which is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the rings at positions 2 and 2', so that's the ortho position relative to the connecting bond. Additionally, each has a nitro group at 6, which is the meta position relative to the connecting bond. So each benzene ring has a nitro group in the meta position, and a carboxylate group as part of the ester.

Wait, but the molecule is an ester: it's the dimethyl ester of the diacid. So the structure is a central biphenyl with two ester groups attached. Each ester is on the same position (2 and 2') but on each respective ring. 

Wait, but biphenyls can have different conformations, but the question is about isomerism. So I'm thinking about whether this compound has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it could have optical isomers.

Wait, in the case of biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are symmetrical, the molecule might not have a chiral center. Alternatively, if the substituents make the molecule asymmetrical, it could have a chiral center or a center of
