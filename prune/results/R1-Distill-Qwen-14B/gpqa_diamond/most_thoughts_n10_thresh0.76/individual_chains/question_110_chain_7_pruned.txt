Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about detecting stars using two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars can be seen by both. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth (apparent magnitude) determines whether a telescope can observe it. The question gives the V magnitude limits for each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V magnitude ≤17. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V ≤16. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be seen by both, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, and ESPRESSO can't either if it's beyond 17. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag (so apparent V ≤17) can be observed, and with HIRES, brighter than 16 mag (apparent V ≤16). So, the star's apparent V must be ≤16 for both to observe it. Because if it's 17, HIRES can't see it. So the apparent magnitude has to be ≤16.

So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are ≤16. Then, those would be the stars detectable by both.

Wait, but not all stars have their apparent magnitudes given. Some have absolute magnitudes and distances, so I need to calculate their apparent V mag using the distance modulus formula.

Let me list the stars:

Star1: Absolute V = 15.5 mag, distance 10 pc. So apparent V = M + 5 log10(d/10) + extinction? Wait, but the question mentions extinction only for Star3 and Star4. Hmm.

Wait, for Star1, the problem doesn't mention any extinction (E(B-V)), so I assume no extinction, so no absorption. So apparent V is M + 5 log (d/10). M is 15.5, d is 10 pc. d/10 is 1, log10(1)=0. So apparent V is 15.5. That's within both telescopes' limits because it's ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5 mag, distance 5 pc. Since it's already given as apparent magnitude, I don't need to calculate. But wait, can I observe it? Because HIRES can go up to 16, but Star2 is 16.5 which is brighter than 16? Wait, wait, no: magnitude scale is inverted. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So if Star2 is at 16.5 mag, which is fainter than 16. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (apparent V ≤16). So 16.5 is too faint for HIRES. So Star2 can't be observed by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO
