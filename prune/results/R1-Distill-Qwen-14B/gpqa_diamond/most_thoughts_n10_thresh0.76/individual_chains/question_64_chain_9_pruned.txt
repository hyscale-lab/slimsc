Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Okay, let's read the problem again.

We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200Â°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases is formed. Without cooling, these gases pass through three tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper.

The results are: tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g (forming CuO), and tube 2 doesn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down. First, the setup. The salts are heated without air, which suggests a decomposition reaction. So, A and B are decomposing when heated. Since they're equimolar, maybe the molar ratio is 1:1.

The gases pass through these tubes. Let's think about what each of these tubes does. 

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, but it's anhydrous here. Wait, no, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent. It's used for drying gases by reacting with water. So any water vapor in the gas mixture would be absorbed here. The tube gains 3.60g, which suggests that 3.60g of water was absorbed. So the gas mixture has water vapor, which is captured here.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. When a gas is passed through a basic solution, it can react if the gas is acidic. If tube 2's weight didn't change, that means no gas reacted with the solution. So any acidic gases like CO2 or HCl must have reacted here. Since the solution didn't change, perhaps those gases weren't present, or maybe they didn't react because the solution was saturated or something else.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. The gas passed through it caused the copper to gain 0.80g, forming CuO. Wait, when a gas reacts with hot copper, what happens? Oh, I remember that CO can react with hot copper to form CO2. Alternatively, maybe H2S could react, but H2S is a gas that wouldn't pass through Mg(ClO4)2 without reacting. Hmm. Wait, but the tube is red-hot copper. So what's going on here.

Wait, in the presence of red-hot copper, maybe the gas is reacting via oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2, which would react to form H2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, when a gas is passed over hot copper, it's often a reaction involving CO. For example, CO could be oxidized to CO2. So, maybe the gas in the mixture contains CO. The reaction would be 2CO + O2 (but wait, no O2 is involved here?), or perhaps the copper is acting as a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's another reaction.

Wait, but in this setup, the copper is probably in a tube, and the gas is moving through it. So, what could cause the copper to gain mass? If the gas is H2S, then maybe it reacts with copper, but I'm not sure under what conditions. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a reducing gas, like H2, which could cause the copper to gain mass as it's oxidized. Let me think. If H2 is present, it could reduce CuO to Cu, but here the copper is gaining mass, so perhaps the opposite is happening.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the gases that could pass through each tube. The first tube captures water, so the initial gas after this would be dry. Then, in tube 2, since no change, any acidic gases like CO2 or HCl must have been removed. Wait, but the
