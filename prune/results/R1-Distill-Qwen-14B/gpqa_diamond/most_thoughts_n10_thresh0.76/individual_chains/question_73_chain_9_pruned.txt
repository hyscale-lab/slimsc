Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical velocity addition. Oh right, I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but wait—what's the scenario here? The two astronauts are moving in the same direction, both in the positive x-direction. So their velocities are u and v, and I want to find the relative speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

Wait, no, the question is asking for the relative speed between them. So let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. From A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or vice versa. Wait, but actually, since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds corrected by the relativistic formula.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Let me get that right. So u is the velocity of B relative to A, or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no—wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of B as seen from the stationary frame, and v is A's velocity in that frame. So from A's frame, what's B's
