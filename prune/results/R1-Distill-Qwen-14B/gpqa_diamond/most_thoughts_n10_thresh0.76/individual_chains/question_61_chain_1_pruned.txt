Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a series of organic reactions starting with benzene and ending up with a final product. I need to figure out each step and identify the final product from the options given.

First, let me break down each reaction step.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1. I remember that nitrating mixture (HNO3 and H2SO4) is used for nitration. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution here. The nitration of benzene typically occurs at the meta position if there's a directing group, but wait, benzene is just benzene. Oh right, benzene without any substituents would undergo nitration at the meta position when using a strong nitrating agent, but wait, no, benzene's first nitration actually forms nitrotoluene at the meta position? Wait, no, wait. Benzene is symmetric, so the first nitration can go in any position, but in reality, the first step for nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene, which is a meta director. Wait, no, wait. No. Wait, benzene when nitrated gives nitrobenzene, which has the nitro group as a meta director. But wait, wait, no. The nitration of benzene is a meta-directing group? No, wait. Nitro groups are meta directors, but when benzene is nitrated for the first time, the nitro group is placed in the meta position? Or para?

Wait no, I think I'm getting confused. When benzene is nitrated, the nitro group is a meta director, but the initial substitution can occur at any position because benzene is symmetric. So the product is nitrobenzene, which has a nitro group attached. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: maybe the first nitration is under certain conditions. Like, if it's a mixture with H2SO4, it's a strong nitrating condition, but for benzene, the nitration occurs to give nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.

Wait, Br2 with Fe is a brominating agent. But wait, when using Fe as a catalyst, bromine can act as a brominating
