Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step. 

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for mass. Oh wait, but wait, the question is about luminosity, which I think depends more on radius and temperature rather than mass. So the mass part might be a red herring, or maybe it's there for another reason. Not sure yet.

The stars' wavelengths of maximum brightness are the same, which means they have the same temperature. Because, you know, according to Wien's Law, lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So if lambda_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. That's a key point.

The radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us much. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh right, Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light gets blueshifted, and moving away causes redshift. But the question said the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is the same. So, the Doppler effect must have adjusted Star_2's emitted wavelength to match Star_1's. 

Wait, so Star_2 is moving, so its emitted wavelength would be shifted. But from the question, the observed wavelengths are the same. That means we have to correct for radial velocity when considering their temperatures. 

Let me think. The original lambda_max for each star is determined by their temperature. But because Star_2 is moving, its observed lambda_max is shifted. So the actual emitted lambda_max would be different. 

So, let's model this. The Doppler shift formula is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), or something like that. Wait, the exact formula for relativistic Doppler effect is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ). But wait, v here is the radial velocity. But wait, in the case where the velocity is towards the observer, v would be positive if moving towards, negative moving away.

Wait, but Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 isn't moving, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But what direction? The velocity doesn't specify direction, but I think in Doppler shift, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift), and moving towards, shorter (blueshift).

But in the problem, the observed lambda_max is the same for both. So Star_2 must have a higher temperature, but due to Doppler shift, the observed lambda_max is the same as Star_1.

Wait, let me think again. Let me denote:

For Star_1: lambda_max1_obs = lambda_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + 0)/(1 - 0) ) = lambda_emit1.

Because Star_1's radial velocity is 0, so no Doppler shift. So observed lambda is same as emitted.

For Star_2: lambda_max2_obs = lambda_emit2 * Doppler factor.

But lambda_max1_obs = lambda_max2_obs = same value, call it lambda_max.

So, lambda_emit2 = lambda_max / Doppler factor.

The Doppler factor for Star_2 is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but wait, v is the radial velocity. But is Star_2 moving towards or away? Since the observed lambda_max is same as Star_1, but Star_2 has a different emitted lambda.

Wait, let's compute the Doppler shift for Star_2. The radial velocity is 700 km/s, but the direction isn't specified. Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. But I think the radial velocity is the component along the line of sight. So if the star is moving towards us, v is positive, away negative.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify direction, just the velocities. So I have to assume that the observed lambda_max for Star_2 has been adjusted because of its velocity. So maybe Star_2 is moving away, which would cause a redshift, so its observed lambda_max would be longer than emitted. But then, since the observed is same as Star_1, its emitted must be shorter (so higher temperature). Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed lambda_max would be shorter, so actual emitted would be longer, implying lower temperature. But since the question says both have same observed lambda_max, perhaps I need to compute the actual emitted temperatures.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me approach it methodically.

Let me denote:

For Star_1:

v1 = 0 km/s.

So, lambda_max1_obs = lambda_emit1 (since no Doppler shift).

For Star_2:

v2 = 700 km/s. The direction is not specified, so I need to figure out whether it's moving towards or away. But regardless, the Doppler effect will adjust the observed wavelength. Let me assume that Star_2 is moving away from us. So, the observed lambda_max2_obs would be longer than the emitted. 

So, according to Wien's law: lambda_max = (constant) / T. So, if lambda_emit2 is the emitted lambda_max for Star_2, and Star_2's observed is lambda_emit2 * Doppler factor. But this must equal lambda_max1_obs.

So let me write the equations.

Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K).

So Star_1: lambda_max1 = b / T1.

Star_2: lambda_emit2 = b / T2.

But the observed lambda_max2 is lambda_emit2 multiplied by the Doppler factor. Because when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer.

The Doppler factor for a source moving away at velocity v is sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), but wait, I think the correct formula when the source is moving away is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) * (1 + v/c) ), but maybe I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Alternatively, for small velocities (v << c), the Doppler shift can be approximated as 1 + v/c.

Wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so 7e5 / 3e8 is about 0.0023, so 0.23% the speed of light. So non-relativistic, so perhaps the approximation is good enough.

The Doppler shift formula for small velocities is approximately:

lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit * (1 + v/c) when moving away.

Wait, no, wait. When the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So, for a source moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_emit multiplied by (1 + v/c). But for a source moving towards, it's (1 - v/c).

Wait, no, that's when the source is moving away, the observed frequency is lower, so wavelength is longer. So lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c) for source moving away.

Alternatively, using the relativistic formula:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But for small v, sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ≈ (1 + x) when x is small (since (1 + x)^2 ≈ 1 + 2x for small x). So in that case, sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ≈ (1 + x). Therefore, the approximation is valid.

So, let's proceed with this.

So, for Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, the observed lambda_max is:

lambda_emit2 * (1 + v/c) = lambda_emit2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e8).

Wait, 700e3 is 700,000 m/s. 700000 / 3e8 = 0.0023333... So approximately 0.233%.

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333.

So, lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * 1.002333.

But according to the question, lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

So,

lambda_emit2 * 1.002333 = lambda_emit1.

But from Wien's law, lambda_emit1 = b / T1, and lambda_emit2 = b / T2.

So,

(b / T2) * (1 + v/c) = (b / T1).

We can cancel b:

1/(T2) * (1 + v/c) = 1/(T1).

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

Which implies that T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

So, T2 is higher than T1, because (1 + v/c) is greater than 1.

Wait, that makes sense. Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer than emitted, which would mean it's hotter than it appears.

Wait, no. Wait, Star
