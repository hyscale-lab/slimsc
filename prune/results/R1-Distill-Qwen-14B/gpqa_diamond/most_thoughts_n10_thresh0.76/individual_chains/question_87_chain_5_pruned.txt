Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about an aromatic compound and its NMR spectrum. Hmm.

So, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbons. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring, right? So the benzene ring has two substituents attached. And the molecular formula? Let's see, benzene is C6H6. If there are two substituents, say each is a group that adds more carbons. But wait, the total carbons are 8, so the substituents must add 2 carbons each because 6 (from benzene) plus 2 substituents (each with 1 carbon) would make 8. Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. Wait, the ring is 6 carbons. The substituents: each substituent is a group. So if the substituents are, say, two groups like -OCH3, each with 1 carbon, that would add 2 carbons, making the total 8. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and another is a halogen. Wait, but the problem says peaks indicate a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So that would be groups like -CO- and -X (like Cl or Br). Wait, but let's think: the substituents on the ring would be a carbonyl-bearing group and a halogen.

Wait, but the carbonyl group is probably a ketone or aldehyde or something. Oh, but wait, aromatic rings with carbonyl groups could be like acetophenone (where the substituent is a ketone), but that's a single substituent. But this is di-substituted. So perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Wait, but let me think again. The molecular formula: number of carbons is 8. Benzene is 6, so the two
