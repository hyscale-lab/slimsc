Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think.

The question is asking about the energy at which high-energy gamma rays' lifetimes in the universe are limited by the process gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, which is super high energy.

I remember that for processes like this, the cross-section (which is a measure of the probability of interaction) plays a role. The cross-section for pair production (like gamma-gamma → e+ e-) depends on the energy of the gamma rays. I think there's a specific energy threshold where this process becomes significant.

Wait, the cross-section for pair production by two photons is given by some formula. I think it's proportional to (E_gamma)^2 * (E_CMB)^2 divided by (m_e^4 c^4), where m_e is the electron mass. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact expression.

Alternatively, I've heard about the photon-photon cross-section being something like sigma ≈ (8π/3) * (α²/(4E²)) * (m_e^2 c^4), but I might be mixing up the variables here. Or maybe it's sigma ∝ (E^2) * (E_photon)^2 / (m_e^4). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the interaction rate. The mean lifetime of a gamma-ray photon would be determined by the rate at which it interacts with CMB photons. The higher the energy, the more likely it is to annihilate, so beyond a certain energy, the lifetime becomes too short for the photon to travel across the universe, hence limiting the observable energy.

The interaction rate, or the mean free path, depends on the cross-section and the density of target photons. The CMB has a lot of photons, but their energy is low.

The formula for the interaction rate (gamma) is Gamma = n_target * sigma * v_rel, where n_target is the number density of target photons, sigma is the cross-section, and v_rel is the relative velocity.

But since the CMB photons are isotropic, the relative velocity can be approximated, maybe using the fact that the speed is close to c, so v_rel ≈ c.

Wait, the cross-section for
