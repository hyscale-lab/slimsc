Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Got it. And phi is -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure del_b.

Wait, what's the relative entropy measure again? The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Oh right, so rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. How do I compute this? I think the first step is to find the density matrix rho for the given state. Since it's a pure state, rho is |psi><psi|. But I'm not sure about the reference Gaussian state here. Oh, wait—maybe the reference Gaussian state is the thermal state or some coherent state? Or perhaps it's the closest Gaussian state to the given state?

Wait, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated between the non-Gaussian state and the closest Gaussian state. So, tau is the density matrix of the best Gaussian approximation to rho. But how do I find that?

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is a coherent state? Because coherent states are Gaussian and often used as reference points in such measures.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is just the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau. But I'm not entirely certain about the specifics.

Wait, let's start with the basics. The state is a superposition of two coherent states: |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). So, when phi is -pi/4, let's compute the coefficients.

Phi is -pi/4, so sin(2phi) would be sin(-pi/2) = -1. Wait, wait. Let me compute cos(phi) and sin(phi) for phi = -pi/4.

cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈
