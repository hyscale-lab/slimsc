Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the setup is that they did an experiment with white lupine to find genes that contribute to anthracnose resistance. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. Then they made knock-out mutants for each, and some double mutants. 

The question says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors usually regulate other genes by binding to their promoters. They tested the mutants for resistance and got these results.

The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (which is 100%). So a lower percentage means more susceptibility. Let me list the data:

- g1: 75% → so more susceptible than wild type, but not as bad as others.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible, same as wild type? Wait no, wait. Wait, the resistance is 0% of control. So the mutant can't resist at all—so it's more susceptible. So wild-type is 100%, g2 is 0%, meaning it's completely susceptible. That's a big effect.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance, so more susceptible than wild type.
- g1g3: 10% → very susceptible. Like, almost no resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone. So even when combined with g3, nothing changes.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone. So when g1 is knocked out along with g2, they're still 0%.

Wait, so what can we infer here? Let's think about the genetics. So when a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it suggests that the other gene is epistatic. Because if gene B is epistatic to gene A, then in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as the one where B is knocked out.

So looking at the data, g2 knockout is 0% resistance. Both the g2g3 and g1g2 double mutants are also 0%. So when g2 is knocked out, adding another mutation (g3 or g1) doesn't change the resistance. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G3 and to G1. Because in the double mutants, the resistance is the same as when G2 is knocked out alone.

Wait, but what about the other way? Suppose G2 is epistatic to G1. That would mean that if G2 is non-functional, the pathway is blocked, regardless of G1's status. So in the double mutant g1g2, the phenotype is the same as g2. That's what's happening here.

So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So in terms of hierarchy, G2 is upstream. Because the epistatic gene is usually downstream. Wait, wait. No, wait. Epistasis can be a bit tricky. When gene B is epistatic to gene A, it means that B is downstream. Because if B is non-functional, the pathway is blocked regardless of A. So in this case, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream of or equal to G1 and G3.

Wait, but let's think about the single mutants. G2 is the most severe, with 0% resistance. G1 is 75%, G3 is 50%. So the presence of G2 is crucial. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, like G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes can't function properly.

But let's think about the double mutants. The g1g2 mutant has 0% resistance, same as g2. So knocking out G1 in addition to G2 doesn't make it worse or
