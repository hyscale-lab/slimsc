Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are in MeV, so it's a small difference, which suggests that maybe relativistic effects are significant here.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since momentum is conserved, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me assign variables. Let the mass of the less massive fragment be m. Then the more massive one is 2m. So the total mass after fission is m + 2m = 3m. But wait, the problem states that the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M. That makes m = (0.99 M)/3. Wait, no, wait: 3m = 0.99 M? Wait, the initial nucleus has mass M, and the sum is 99% of M. So yes, 3m = 0.99 M, so m= (0.99 M) /3, so m = 0.33 M approximately. Then the more massive fragment is 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is the initial rest mass. Let me think, perhaps I should write m1 = 2m, m2 = m. So m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M, yeah. So m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M.

Wait, but then the initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. So the rest mass energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. But when it splits, the rest mass of the two fragments is 0.99 M, so their rest mass energy is 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the mass defect is 3 GeV, which would be converted into kinetic energy and other forms like binding energy or radiation, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe the kinetic energy of the fragments is from that 3 GeV? Hmm, but wait, the problem mentions rest-mass energy, so perhaps the kinetic energy is due to the mass defect.

But wait, the problem is about the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment. So let's model this.

In a classical (non-relativistic) approximation, we can use the concept of conservation of momentum and kinetic energy.
