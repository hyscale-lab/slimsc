Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the distance its ejecta travels. Hmm, I need to figure out the right approach. Let me read it again.

The question says that a supernova occurred in our Galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so I'm dealing with two different reference frames hereâ€”Galaxy and ejecta. The key here is probably to use the concept of relative velocity and maybe time dilation or length contraction from special relativity.

But wait, since the problem states that both are inertial frames, I can probably use the velocity addition formula from relativity. Oh, right, because velocities don't just add linearly in relativity; you have to consider the speed of light limitations.

Wait, the supernova ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center as per the Galaxy's frame, but from the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center is moving towards it. So, perhaps I should first find the actual velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no. Let's think about it. Let me denote the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy as u. From the problem, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy (in particular, the center) is
