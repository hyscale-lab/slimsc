Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that a chemist is performing two reactions and then analyzing the combined products using HPLC. The reactions involve (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Both reactions go to completion.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are typically used in epoxidation reactions. So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. But wait, the configuration of the double bond (E or Z) will affect the product, right?

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA. Epoxidation occurs. Since (E) is trans, the epoxide will form in a certain configuration. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed ring opening. 

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA. Again, epoxidation, but with a cis double bond. Then acid workup.

Wait, but what happens to the epoxide upon acid treatment? Epoxides usually open in acid via a two-step process. First, protonation of the oxygen, which makes the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Then, a nucleophilic attack by water (or another nucleophile) occurs. 

But in the case of symmetric epoxides, like those formed from oct-4-ene, the epoxide will have two identical substituents on each carbon. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end, so the epoxide would be like O connecting two CH2CH2 groups. So for both E and Z, the epoxide is the same? Because the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), but the epoxide would have the same structure? Or does the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affect the epoxide structure?

Wait, no. Wait, the starting alkenes are (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Wait, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let's see: the structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me think. Octane is C8H18. Oct-4-ene would have a double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, actually, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me correct that. No, for oct-4-ene, it's actually:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3:
