Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says that a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other to produce two A+ and two A- particles. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, so maybe we can assume its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy? Or wait, no, because when particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other forms. 

Wait, the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. Each A has a mass energy of 300 MeV. So, the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. Let me think about their rest mass energies. The proton mass is about 938 MeV/c², and the same for the antiproton. So, the total rest mass energy of the system is 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV. 

But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means that its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate the total energy as just the sum of the rest energies. But wait, what about the proton? The problem says the antiproton is moving, but it doesn't specify the proton's state. Oh, wait, in the initial state, it's p and p̄ colliding. So I think the proton is at rest, or perhaps moving with some velocity, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, maybe it's that the antiproton's speed is low, so v ≈ 0, but that's probably not the case. Or perhaps the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass.

Wait, but when particles annihilate, energy and momentum must be conserved. So the initial momentum comes from the moving antiproton. The proton is at rest, so initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. The final products, the two A+ and two A- particles, must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum.

But wait, the problem is asking for the velocity of particle A, so all the A particles must be moving in the same direction or perhaps opposite? Not sure, but maybe they are moving in the same direction since the initial momentum is from the antiproton.

Hmm, let me think about the conservation of energy and
