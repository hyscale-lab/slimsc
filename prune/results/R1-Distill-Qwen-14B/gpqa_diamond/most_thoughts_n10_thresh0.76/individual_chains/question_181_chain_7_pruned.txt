Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Let's see what the problem says. 

The question is about the Sun's neutrino production. Normally, the Sun produces neutrinos through various reactions, and one of them is the pp-III branch. The pp-III branch stops hypothetically about 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth. So if the pp-III branch stops, the effects on Earth would be felt after that time delay.

The question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1. 

Wait, I remember that the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core. In the standard model, the pp chain is the dominant source of solar energy. The pp-III branch involves the fusion of a proton with a helium-3 ion. And the neutrinos from this process are the high-energy ones, right?

If the pp-III branch stops, the production of those high-energy neutrinos would stop. But other reactions, like the pp-I and pp-II branches, continue. Wait, no, actually, the pp chain has several branches. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing a significant amount of high-energy neutrinos, I think.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the number of high-energy neutrinos would drop. But how does that affect the flux in these two bands?

Let me think about the neutrino energy spectrum. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with higher energies, around a few MeV, maybe 800 keV and up. So band 2 is 800-900 keV. If pp-III stops, band 2's flux would decrease because that's where those neutrinos are. 

But what about band 1, 700-800 keV? Are those primarily from other processes? I think the pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos. Wait, no. Let me recall: the pp chain has different steps. The dominant process is the pp-I branch where a proton captures a proton to form deuterium, then another proton, and so on. Alternatively, the pp chain can go through the pp-II and pp-III branches, which involve helium-3.

The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, around 0.5 MeV and below. The pp-II and pp-III branches produce higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps above 1 MeV. So, the pp-III branch is a major contributor to the higher-energy neutrinos.

So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like those in band 2) would drop. But the lower energy neutrinos (band 1) are still being produced by the other branches.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between band 1 and band 2. Before the pp-
