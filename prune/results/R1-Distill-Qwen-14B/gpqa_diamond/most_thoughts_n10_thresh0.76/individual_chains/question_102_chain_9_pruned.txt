Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. 

So, the question is about a genetic construct in a mouse model and why a certain fluorescent signal isn't showing up. The setup involves a bicistronic vector with a ligand and receptor, and using Cre-lox systems for expression.

First, let me understand the components. The construct is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) under a single promoter. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. Wait, no, the question says the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after IRES. So the vector is probably designed so that the CBA promoter drives the expression of the ligand, and then the IRES allows for the expression of the receptor. But I'm a bit unclear on how the IRES works here.

Looking at the vector structure: the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and there's a stop cassette with loxP. Then comes the IRES, followed by the receptor ORF fused to eGFP with a lox2272 stop cassette. So when the vector is introduced, the CBA promoter should drive the transcription of the entire bicistronic mRNA. The mRNA would have the ligand ORF followed by the IRES, which then allows the receptor ORF to be translated. But wait, the stop cassettes are between ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP. Hmm, I think the stop cassettes are designed to prevent read-through into the other reporter. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

Wait, but wait. The vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So I think that in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes are present, so the ligand is expressed (since it's under the CBA promoter) but the stop prevents mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed but the eGFP would not, unless Cre is present to excise the stops. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, the ligand is at 5', fused to mCherry, but there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between them. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassette is in place, so the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry would not be, because the stop is in between. Similarly, the receptor is at 3', with a lox2272 stop cassette before eGFP. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't, unless Cre excises the stops.

But the setup is such that when Cre is introduced, it would recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stops. So, in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry would be co-expressed (lig
