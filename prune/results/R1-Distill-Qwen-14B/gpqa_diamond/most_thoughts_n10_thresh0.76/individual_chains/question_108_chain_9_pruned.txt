Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the problem states that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Oh wait, m is usually the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum, right? And for hydrogen, the energy levels split due to the Zeeman effect when an external magnetic field is applied.

So the question is comparing two terms: the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE. The paramagnetic coupling is probably the Zeeman term, which perturbs the energy levels. The transition energy is the energy difference between two states, like the Balmer series in hydrogen, maybe the H-alpha line with wavelength 0.4861 micrometers.

I think the paramagnetic coupling term here refers to the magnetic interaction energy. The formula for the Zeeman effect is something like ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait, is it linear or quadratic? Oh, right, for the normal Zeeman effect, it's linear in B, so yeah, ΔE is proportional to B times m.

The transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength. I can find the energy using E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = Let me compute that step by step. 6.626e-34 *3e8 is 1.9878e-25. Divide by 486.1e-9: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.089e-19 J. Wait, that's Joules. To convert to electron volts, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, but wait, that's way too high. Because the Balmer series is in the visible range, which is about 10-100 nm. Wait, wait, wait, 0.486 micrometers is 486 nm, which is in the visible range, so the energy should be about 2.5 eV? I thought the Balmer series was lower than that. Wait, no, let me think. The Lyman series is higher energy, ionizing photons. Balmer is visible, but the transition from n=6 to n=2, for example, would be about 486 nm. Let me recall, the energy levels of hydrogen are E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E is -13.6/4 = -3.4 eV. For n=1, it's -13.6 eV. So the energy difference between n=2 and n=3 is (13.6/4 - 13.6/9), which is (3.4 - 1.511) = 1.889 eV. Oh wait, but that's the emission line when an electron drops from n=3 to n=2, which is the Balmer-alpha line, but that's 656 nm, the H-alpha line. Hmm, but the given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486 nm, that's the Balmer-beta line, which is from n=4 to n=2. Let me compute that. E_4 = -13.6/(16) = -0.85 eV. E_2 is -3.4 eV. So ΔE = (-3.4) - (-0.85) ) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV. So that matches the calculation I did earlier. So the transition energy is about 2.55 eV.

Now, what about the paramagnetic coupling term, the Zeeman energy? The Zeeman term for each state is proportional to m times the magnetic field. The formula is E_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. But wait, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is about 9.274e-24 J/T. And the magnetic quantum number m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, but for hydrogen, higher orbitals have higher m. Wait, but the problem says m is small, so m could be around 1 or 2. Let's take m=1 for example.

So E_Zeeman = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J. Now, convert that to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So about 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, but the transition energy is 2.55 eV. So the Zeeman term is way smaller. So the paramagnetic term is << transition energy.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the order of magnitude. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy. So the expectation value <H> (which I think refers to the perturbing Hamiltonian) is much less than ΔE.

So the options are:

A) <H> equals ΔE.

B) <H> much greater than ΔE.

C) <H> << ΔE.

D) <H> > ΔE.

So the correct option is C, since 5.8e-5 eV is much less than 2.55 eV.

Wait, but wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. The transition energy is about 2.55 eV, and the Zeeman term is about 5.8e-5 eV. So 5.8e-5 is 5.8 * 1e-5, which is 0.000058 eV. Compared to 2.55 eV, that's 5.8e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5, which is about 0.002% of ΔE. So yes, much smaller.

Another thought: the paramagnetic term is the perturbation. So in perturbation theory, if the perturbation is much smaller than the energy levels, then it's a small effect. So in this case, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, the transition energy is the energy difference between two states, and the param
