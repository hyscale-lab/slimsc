Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's positioned geometrically in the qubits space. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that the density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Oh right, for a qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a vector in a 3-dimensional space, right?

Density matrices for qubits can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has three coordinates corresponding to the Pauli matrices. So, any density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space and σ are the Pauli matrices.

Okay, so let's break it down. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Wait, |0><0| is the outer product, which for a basis state would have 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in (1,1). Adding them together would give a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements as 1. Multiply by 1/2, so the diagonal becomes 0.5 each. So the matrix ρ is diagonal with [0.5, 0; 0, 0.5].

Now, how does this relate to the Bloch vector? The general form is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Wait no, more accurately, it's (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2, where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

So, for a diagonal density matrix like this, the off-diagonal terms are zero. Let me write the matrix ρ:

ρ = [[0.5, 0],
     [0, 0.5]]

The Pauli matrices are:
X = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

If I expand the Bloch sphere representation: (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2.

Let me compute this. I is the identity matrix, so (I) is [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then, r_x X is r_x * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is [[0, r_x],[r_x, 0]]. Similarly, r_y Y is [[0, -i r_y],[i r_y, 0]], and r_z Z is [[r_z, 0],[0, -r_z]].

So when you sum all these, including I and each Pauli term, and divide by 2, you get:

(1/2) * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y ],
            [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z ] ]

Wait, let me compute each part
