Okay, so I have this question about planets and the probability of them transiting. Hmm, I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter periodâ€”three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because a shorter orbital period means it's orbiting more quickly, and probably in a tighter orbit.

The host stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh wait, but the star's radius is the same. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not any bigger in size.

I think the transit probability formula is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, I think it's more about the orbital distance. Oh right, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / R_star), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. Oh right, the probability P is approximately
