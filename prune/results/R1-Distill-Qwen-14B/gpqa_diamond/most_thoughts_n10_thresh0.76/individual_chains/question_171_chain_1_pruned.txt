Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the problem states that substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are A, B, C, D.

First off, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. The substituents can be either activating or deactivating, and they can be ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.

Wait, each substituent will influence where the bromine adds. For para-substituted products to form, the substituent must direct the incoming bromine to the para position. So the more the substituent directs to para, the higher the yield of the para-isomer, right?

But wait, the question is about the "weight fraction" of the para-isomer. So I think that para might be one of the possible products, and when a substituent is a strong director, more para product is formed, making its weight fraction higher. But for some substituents, the product might not have a para isomerâ€”like if the substituent is meta-directing, then the bromine would add meta, and para isn't an option. So for those, the para fraction would be zero.

Wait, no. Because the substituent directs, some substituents can lead to multiple products. Wait, but in this question, each substance gives only one monobromo derivative. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe each substituent leads to a single major product because of strong directing. So for example, nitro groups are meta directors, so the bromine would add meta to them, leading to only one product. Whereas something like a methyl group is an ortho/para director, leading to a mixture of ortho and para products, but when the substituent is strongly activating, para is favored more. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, so each substituent leads to only one product. That means the substituents are such that the electrophile attacks only in one position, either ortho, meta, or para, but only one is possible. So for example, if a substituent is meta directing, bromine adds meta, but in that case, there's only one possible position, so para isn't an option. So the para fraction would be zero for such substituents.

So the para fraction is the percentage of the product that is para-substituted. But wait, if the substituent is such that only para is possible, then the para fraction is 100%. But if the substituent is ortho/para directing but mono-substituted, and there are two possible positions (ortho and para), the product would be a mixture. But the question says only one monobromo product is formed. Hmm, maybe the substituents are such that only one position is possible. For example, when there are two substituents that block other positions, but that's probably not the case here.
