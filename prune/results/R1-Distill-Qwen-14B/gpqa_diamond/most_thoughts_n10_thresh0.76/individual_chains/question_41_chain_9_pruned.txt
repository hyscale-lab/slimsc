Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? And the speed of light in vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, so the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light beam. Wait, wait. No, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well, but in the same direction as the beam. That might mean that the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is towards the observer. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me visualize it.

Imagine the observer is on one side, and the glass is moving towards them. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's movement. So both the light and the glass are moving towards the observer, but the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is inside the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n, since the index of refraction n is the ratio of c to the speed in the medium.

But the question is about the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame, where the glass is moving. So I think I need to consider how the motion of the glass affects the speed of the light in the lab's frame. Wait, but in reality, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Because of the postulate of special relativity. Wait, but this is a problem about the speed in the medium, and the medium is moving. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving through the glass. So the speed of the light relative to the lab would be the speed of light in the glass plus the speed of the glass? But wait, that's using Galilean addition, which is only valid at non-relativistic speeds. At high speeds, we need to use Lorentz transformations. But since the problem gives c=1, perhaps we're to consider relativistic effects.

Wait, but the options don't look like they're using Lorentz factor terms. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the speed of light in the glass is c/n, and then adding the velocity of the glass using classical addition. Let me think.

Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. So when the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction (towards the observer), the speed of the light as seen from the lab would be the speed of the light in the glass plus the speed of the glass. But wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v, so the light's speed would be (c/n) + v? But wait, that's if the velocities add
