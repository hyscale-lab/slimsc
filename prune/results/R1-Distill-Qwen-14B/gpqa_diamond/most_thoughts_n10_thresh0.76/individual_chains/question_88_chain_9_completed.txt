Okay, so I've got this science question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

So the question says that the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they noticed some issues: some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. But then they identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene showed high variability. And the question is asking which process is taking place.

Alright, let's start by recalling what each part means. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, and its capsid proteins are important for infection. The inner capsid proteins are probably the ones that help in the immune response, maybe as antigens.

GFP tagging would help visualize where these proteins go in the body. Oral gavage means they're introducing them into the stomach. The problems observed—like destruction by stomach acid and entanglement in mucus—probably mean that not all the proteins made it to where they were supposed to go. But some did reach the Peyer's patches, which are specialized areas in the gut associated with immune responses. Peyer's patches are part of the secondary lymphoid organs, which include places like lymph nodes and the spleen.

In the Peyer's patches, the fluorescent proteins would be taken up by immune cells, probably antigen-presenting cells. Then, these cells would interact with other immune cells, perhaps leading to an immune response. The proliferating cell population they isolated—those cells are likely B cells that are activated and dividing. When B cells proliferate, they undergo processes that diversify their antibodies, right?

The variable heavy chain gene's high variability suggests that something is causing the genes to change. So, what processes cause variability in B cell receptors? I remember a few key processes: VDJ recombination (which happens during B cell development in the bone marrow), somatic hypermutation (which happens after activation, leading to affinity maturation), and class switching recombination (which changes the class of antibody, like from IgM to IgG).

VDJ recombination occurs early, when the B cell is forming, and it's the process where the variable, diversity, and joining gene segments are combined. This creates the initial diversity of the B cell receptor. But if the cells are already in the Peyer's patches and proliferating, that might be after the initial stages, so VDJ might not be happening there. 

Somatic hypermutation is a process that happens after the B cell is activated. It introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. This helps the immune system respond more effectively to antigens. So if they're seeing high variability in the variable heavy chain, it could be due to somatic hypermutation.

Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces, like moving from producing IgM to IgG. This process doesn't change the variable regions, just the constant region. So sequencing the variable region wouldn't show much change from class switching.

So putting it all together: the rotavirus proteins were ingested, some reached the Peyer's patches and were taken up by B cells. These B cells then started proliferating, which would involve activation. During this proliferation, the B cells undergo somatic hypermutation to diversify their antibodies, which explains the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Therefore, the process happening is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Despite some fluorescence being destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus, some proteins reached the Peyer's patches, which are specialized secondary lymphoid tissues in the gut. In these patches, the fluorescent proteins were taken up by immune cells, likely activating B cells, which then proliferated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating cells revealed high variability.

This variability is indicative of a process that diversifies the B cell receptor after activation. Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs after B cell activation and introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing antibody diversity. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.
- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves the complement system targeting pathogens and is unrelated to the observed variability in the variable heavy chain gene.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable region, so it does not explain the observed variability.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes initial diversity. It is unlikely to be occurring in the Peyer's patches after antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during B cell proliferation in response to antigenic stimulation. 

Answer: A
