Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says there's an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also determine the form of f.

The options given are A to D, each with different fractions and lambda dependencies.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated depends on the frequency and the direction θ. For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern has a specific dependence on θ.

Wait, the dipole radiation pattern is something like proportional to (1 + cos²θ) divided by something, or maybe it's sin²θ. Oh wait, no, the radiation pattern for a dipole is I think proportional to sin²θ. Let me think: in the dipole approximation, the power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation pattern) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So maximum at θ=90 degrees, and zero at θ=0 and 180. But wait, no, wait. Wait, for a dipole, the radiation is maximum perpendicular to the dipole direction. So for a dipole aligned along z, maximum at θ=90 degrees. So the pattern might be (sinθ)^2 or maybe (1 + cos²θ). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should recall the exact formula.

The radiated power per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) for a dipole is given by (something like) (μ_0/(4π)) * (e² sin²θ)/(something with c and the frequency). Oh wait, more precisely, the formula for the power is ( ( (e^2) (ω^4) ) / (6πε₀ c^3) ) * sin²θ. So the function f depends on sinθ squared.

So in this case, the function f would include sin²θ. But wait, the function f is a function of λ and θ. Also, since λ is related to ω (since λ = 2π c / ω), maybe the dependence on λ comes in as λ^4 or something else.

Wait, the power formula I remember is P = ( ( ( e^2 ω^4 ) / (6πε₀ c^3) ) * (1/4π) ) * (something). Alternatively, another version: the average power is ( ( e^2 ω^4 ) / (6πε₀ c^3 ) ) * ( (1/(4π)) ), but I'm not sure about the exact constants.

Wait, perhaps the key here is the dependence on λ. Since ω = 2π c / λ, so ω^4 is proportional to (1/λ^4). So the function f would have a dependence of 1/λ^4, multiplied
