Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but I'll think this through.

So, the scenario is that they've tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and given them to mice orally. Through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, the stomach is acidic, so maybe the proteins got broken down there. But some made it through and got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Oh, wait, the secondary lymphoid organs in the gut are like Peyer's patches, right? So they isolated those and took the proliferating cells, then sequenced their variable heavy chain genes, finding high variability.

The question is about which process is happening here.

Let me look at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation
B) Complement activation
C) Class switching recombination
D) VDJ recombination

Hmm. So, what's each process about?

VDJ recombination is during the formation of B cell receptors in the bone marrow. It's the process where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to create the diverse B cell receptors. This happens during the early stages of B cell development.

Somatic hypermutation occurs after the B cells have been activated, typically in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. This process introduces mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing the diversity of the antibodies produced. It's a way to fine-tune the immune response.

Class switching recombination, also known as isotype switching, is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG). This doesn't change the variable region but the constant region. It's guided by signals from other immune cells.

Complement activation is part of the innate immune response, involving a series of proteins that attack pathogens. It's more about the complement system's role in killing pathogens rather than generating diversity in B cell receptors.

Now, back to the experiment. The GFP-tagged proteins were given orally, so they're antigens. They ended up in the Peyer's patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). In Peyer's patches, B cells are activated by these antigens, leading to an immune response. 

The cells isolated are proliferating, which means they are probably activated B cells. Sequencing their variable heavy chains shows high variability. So what process increases the variability in the variable regions? That's where somatic hypermutation comes in. Because the VDJ recombination is already done when the B cells are formed; that's the initial diversity. But within the same antigen, the B cells in the germinal centers undergo somatic hypermutation to increase affinity and diversity further.

Wait, but when the B cells are activated, they go through the germinal centers where somatic hypermutation occurs. So in this case, the Peyer's patches would have germinal centers where this process is active, leading to the high variability in the variable regions.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.

Wait, but could it be VDJ recombination? No, because VDJ happens earlier during B cell development. The cells here are already mature and undergoing activation, so it's more about hypermutation than initial recombination.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescent proteins were partially destroyed by stomach acid but some reached the intestinal mucus and eventually the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut. The proliferating cells in these patches were isolated, and sequencing their variable heavy chain genes revealed high variability.

To determine the process responsible for this variability, the key options are analyzed:

- **VDJ recombination** occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to form the initial diversity of B cell receptors. This process is not relevant here, as the B cells in the Peyer's patches are already mature.

- **Somatic hypermutation** is a process that occurs in germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, including Peyer's patches. It introduces mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing diversity and affinity for antigens. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

- **Class switching recombination** changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variable region. This is unrelated to the observed variability in the variable heavy chains.

- **Complement activation** is part of the innate immune response and does not involve generating diversity in B cell receptors.

Given that the experiment involves mature B cells in the Peyer's patches undergoing activation and proliferation, the process responsible for the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
