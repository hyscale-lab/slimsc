Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. The researcher uses TLC to check the reaction progress and sees that the reactant spot has diminished, meaning the reaction is proceeding. Two new spots have formed, so two products are formed. I need to figure out which option correctly represents these products.

The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure. The benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The ether's other side is a but-3-en-1-yl group, which is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 3. Wait, no: but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, butenyl groups: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, but but is four carbons. Let me number them: 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait no, because the substituent starts at 1, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond from C3 to C4? That doesn't make sense because but-3-en-1-yl would imply the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- (but wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would actually be CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. But-3-en-1-yl group: the parent chain is butene, four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C4. But wait, that would make it 1-propenyl or something else? Alternatively, maybe I should imagine the structure.

Wait, but the structure given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the substituent is on the benzene's oxygen. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 3. So, the structure would be:

O

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me count the positions.

But-3-en-1-yl: the substituent starts at carbon 1 (the point of attachment), then carbons 2, 3, 4. So, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that's not possible because that would be a terminal double bond. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, another approach: but-3-en-1-yl group structure. So the structure is CH2=CH-
