Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a specific matrix. The matrix S has first row [0, -i] and second row [i, 0]. So S looks like this:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

Wait, right, S is similar to the Pauli matrices. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Oh wait, S here looks like the Pauli y matrix multiplied by i or something? Let me think. The Pauli y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, no, actually, the Pauli y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. Oh wait, yes, so S is σ_y. So the operator A_y is c multiplied by σ_y, where c is h/(4π).

I remember that the angular momentum operators are related to the Pauli matrices. For spin-½ particles like the muon, the spin matrices are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. But in this case, the operator A is given as c multiplied by S, which is σ_y. So c is h/(4π), so let me write A_y as (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, it's a 2-level system. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

But wait, let's write down the matrix A_y. Since σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], multiplying by c gives:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix is:

[ 0          -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)      0
