Okay, so I have this genetics question about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about gene interactions, specifically focusing on transcription factors and epistasis, I think.

So, the setup: there are three genes, G1, G2, and G3. They knocked out each gene, creating mutants g1, g2, g3, and also made double mutants g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. The experiment tested resistance to anthracnose. The wild-type has 100% resistance, so lower percentages mean more susceptibility.

Looking at the results:
- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild type)
- g2: 0% (super susceptible, same as being completely infected)
- g3: 50% (moderately susceptible)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Hmm. The question tells us that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, the TF probably regulates other genes involved in resistance.

Let me think about what each result tells us.

First, the single mutants:
- g2 is completely susceptible. So knocking out G2 completely removes resistance. That suggests G2 might be a key gene, possibly the transcription factor. Because if the TF is gone, then the downstream genes it regulates wouldn't be expressed, leading to no resistance.

g1 has 75% resistance. So it's somewhat resistant, but less than wild type. Maybe G1 is part of the pathway but not the master regulator.

g3 has 50% resistance. So it's even more susceptible than g1.

Now the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's as bad as g2. Hmm. Since g2 alone is 0%, maybe G1 is part of the same pathway as G2, but when G2 is gone, G1 doesn't matter. Or maybe G1 is upstream of G2?

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, maybe G1 is another transcription factor, but not the main one. Or perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Let me think about epistasis here.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of B depends on A. For example, if a plant requires both A and B to function, but A is upstream, then knocking out A would make B irrelevant.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So, when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's as bad as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2's function is downstream of G1, and G1 is epistatic to G2. Wait, no. Because when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, and when both are knocked out, it's still 0%. So perhaps G2 is necessary, but G1 is not. Or maybe G1 is in a parallel pathway.

Wait, another angle: if the double mutant g1g2 doesn't have worse resistance than either single mutant, that suggests that the two genes are in the same pathway. Because if they were in separate pathways, you might see additive effects (like 25% instead of 50% if each single mutant is 50% resistant, but that's not the case here).

Alternatively, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1, then knocking out G2 would also knock out G1's expression. So, in that case, g1g2 would be the same as g2 because G2 is upstream. But
