Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, specifically Cope and Claisen rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond with the movement of pi bonds. The general idea is that a part of the molecule moves along a conjugated system. 

The question has three parts, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C from the given reactions. There are four options, each giving different possibilities for A, B, and C. Let me take each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form A.

Wait, so the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure would have two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So, it's like (CH3O)2CHNH2. The other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, wait. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2OHCH2CH3? No, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure properly.

But-3-en-2-ol: the butenol. But has four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C2 (since it's 3-en), and the OH is on C2. So structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Because the positions are numbered so that the double bond starts at carbon 2. No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH
