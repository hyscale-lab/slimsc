Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism has to do with the magnetic properties of materials due to the electrons' spin. But wait, let me think this through step by step.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz and has a value of 1 Tesla. Oh right, Tesla is the unit for magnetic field strength. And m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which usually has small values. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum, right? It can be -l, -l+1, ..., 0, ..., l-1, l. So for a given orbital, m can be up to l, but in this case, the values are small. Maybe like m=0 or 1 or something like that.

The problem is asking to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Hamiltonian term due to the magnetic field interacting with the electron's spin) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition is associated with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about the wavelength of the Balmer series in hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line. So that transition energy ΔE would correspond to the energy difference between two energy levels in hydrogen.

So I need to find the magnitude of the paramagnetic term and compare it to this ΔE. Let me break it down.

First, the paramagnetic term. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect
