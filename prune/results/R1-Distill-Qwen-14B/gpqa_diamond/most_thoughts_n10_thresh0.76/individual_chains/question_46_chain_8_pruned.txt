Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, probably Ruthenium-based, which helps in these reactions.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a monoene, so why is it racemic? Oh, wait noâ€”maybe it's because the molecule has a stereocenter. Wait, no, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me draw the structure.

Actually, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH2? Wait, wait, pent-1-ene is five carbons with a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, pent is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me count:

Pent has five carbons. So 1 2 3 4 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that would be six carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? No, that would be 3-m
