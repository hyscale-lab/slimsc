Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So, the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. Norbornene derivatives are common in some reactions, like Diels-Alder maybe?

Then, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile. The diene has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So, each of those has a Br attached to a CH2 group.

Wait, when you have dibromomethyl groups next to a diene, maybe this is a case for a Diels-Alder reaction? Or perhaps some kind of elimination or substitution?

Alternatively, sodium iodide is often used in elimination reactions, like the E2 mechanism, where a base abstracts a proton and a leaving group departs, forming a double bond. But with two equivalents of that compound, maybe it's a di-elimination? Or maybe a substitution?

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each dibromomethyl is Br-CH2- attached to the cyclohexene. So, each Br is a good leaving group. So, perhaps the starting material (the norbornene) reacts with this in some way. Wait, maybe it's an example of a ring-opening metathesis? Or perhaps a Diels-Alder, but norbornene is a diene itself. Oh wait, but norbornene has two double bondsâ€”no, actually, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has one double bond, right? Because the numbering is 2 and 5, so it's a conjugated diene? Or is it two separate double bonds?

Wait, the structure of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a nor
