Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. After that, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to make product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C to give product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4, with options A to D.

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to track each reaction step and figure out the structure of each product, especially product 4, and then determine the number of distinct hydrogens.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That structure sounds familiar. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane, right? So the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So it's like norbornene with two double bonds? Wait, the molecule is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which means there are two double bonds at positions 2 and 5 in the norbornane system.

So the structure would have two double bonds, making it a bicyclic diene. Now, combining this with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I think this might be a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the starting diene is a diene, and the other compound has two dibromomethyl groups, which are probably dienophiles.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene structure: cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two double bonds, right? So in positions 1 and 3, and then each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group attached. So each of those is a CH2Br2 substituent.

But wait, the dienophile in Diels-Alder is usually something like a dienophile with a good electron-deficient double bond. The diene here would be the bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So perhaps it's acting as a diene, and the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the dienophile.

Wait, but each of the substituents on the cyclohexene might have their own reactivity. Alternatively, maybe the 5,6 positions have methyl groups with two bromines attached. So each of those is a CH2Br2 group.

If the starting diene (norbornadiene) reacts with the dienophile, which is this cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups. Since two equivalents are used, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur.

Wait, but the norbornene has two double bonds. So maybe each dienophile can add in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is the diene, and each of the two dienophiles (two equivalents) will each add across each double bond? Hmm, but norbornadiene has conjugated double bonds, so maybe each of the two dienophiles adds to each of the two double bonds.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: Diels-Alder requires a diene (conjugated double bonds) and a dienophile (like a single double bond). So if the starting material is a diene (norbornadiene), then each equivalent of dienophile would react in a Diels-Alder fashion, perhaps leading to a bicyclic structure with two adducts.

But let me think about the structure. The dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, but if each of the 5 and 6 positions has a CH2Br2 group, perhaps those are electron-withdrawing groups, activating the double bond as a dienophile.

Wait, but Diels-Alder typically uses a diene (like butadiene) and a dienophile (like a carbonyl or another electron-deficient dienophile). So maybe the dienophile in this case is the cyclohexadiene with the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is cyclohexa-1,3-diene itself, but that seems unlikely because it's a conjugated diene and may not be a good dienophile. Alternatively, the substituents (dibromomethyl) could activate the double bonds as dienophiles.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the norbornadiene (diene) and each of the two dienophiles.

Wait, but each dienophile has two substituents, so maybe each dienophile will add to each of the two double bonds in the norbornadiene? Or perhaps the norbornadiene has two double bonds, and each dienophile molecule reacts with each double bond.

Wait, wait. Let me think: the starting molecule is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So positions 2 and 5 have double bonds. So it's a norbornene with two double bonds, perhaps conjugated.

So the first reaction is with two equivalents of the dienophile. So maybe two Diels-Alder reactions occur, each adding across each of the double bonds in the norbornadiene. Each dienophile would add to each double bond, and since there are two dienophiles, perhaps each dienophile adds to each double bond. Or perhaps each dienophile adds to each diene.

Wait, but each dienophile has two dienophilic sites? No, wait, the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So it's a conjugated diene with two substituents. So perhaps each dienophile can act as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, perhaps each dienophile molecule (which has two double bonds) could react with the norbornadiene in a Diels-Alder fashion. But since the starting material is a bicyclic diene, maybe each of the two dienophiles adds to the two double bonds present.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the cyclohexa-1,3-diene part, and the substituents are activating groups. So the diene (norbornadiene) reacts with each of the two dienophiles (each dienophile being the cyclohexene part) in separate Diels-Alder reactions.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Another possibility is that the reaction is a ring-opening. Since the norbornadiene is a bicyclic compound, perhaps the dienophiles are opening it.

Wait, but sodium iodide (NaI) is present. Sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which can act as a nucleophile. So perhaps this is a ring-opening via an elimination or substitution reaction.

Wait, another thought: the starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which is a good leaving group under certain conditions. But when combined with NaI, perhaps an SN2 reaction occurs. But the structure is a bicyclic ether; perhaps the tert-butoxy group is at a bridgehead, making it difficult for SN2 attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about what the product after the first step would look like.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction between the norbornadiene and each of the dienophiles. Each dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups. So when they react in a Diels-Alder, the dienophile's double bond would form a six-membered ring with the diene.

So the diene (norbornadiene) would combine with each dienophile in a Diels-Alder to form a bicyclic structure with substituents.

Wait, but each dienophile has two substituents. So perhaps each dienophile would add to one of the dienes in the norbornadiene. So two Diels-Alder reactions would occur, each adding a dienophile's substituents to the norbornadiene structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophiles are adding in such a way that the norbornadiene's rings are expanded.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should move to the next step and see if that gives any clues.

Product 1 is then treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, often used in acid-catalyzed reactions, like protonation of certain groups or in elimination reactions. Maybe the first product has some leaving groups, and under acidic conditions, they are eliminated.

Looking back, the dienophiles had dibromomethyl groups (CH2Br2). So after the Diels-Alder, perhaps the substituents are attached as CH2Br groups. Then, under acidic conditions, perhaps elimination occurs to form rings or double bonds.

Wait, for example, if in product 1, the substituents are CH2Br groups, then in H2SO4, they could undergo elimination, forming a double bond. Because in such conditions, HBr is removed, and double bonds form.

So if product 1 has CH2Br groups attached to a bicyclic structure, treating with H2SO4 (acid) would cause the CH2Br groups to lose HBr and form double bonds. So we might get new rings or alkenes formed.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, often used for sulfonation. Pyridine is a base and can act as a catalyst or as a base to absorb H+.

DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent, often used in oxidation reactions. Wait, or maybe in the presence of SO3 and pyridine, it's a sulfonation reaction. SO3 is used for sulfonation of alcohols, amines, or other nucleophilic groups. So perhaps product 2 has some hydroxyl groups or other nucleophilic sites.

Wait, but product 2 came from treating product 1 with H2SO4. If product 1 resulted from Diels-Alder, and then elimination occurred to form double bonds, maybe product 2 is a more conjugated or aromatic system. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms some rings, leading to a structure with more double bonds.

Alternatively, maybe in product 1, the substituents are CH2Br groups attached to the norbornane structure. Then, under acidic conditions, they eliminate HBr, leading to the formation of new double bonds.

Wait, if a CH2Br group is adjacent to another CH2Br group, then upon acid treatment, they could lose two HBr molecules and form a double bond. For example, CH2Br-CH2Br could lose 2 HBr to become CH2=CH2. But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br group is attached to a ring, and elimination leads to a ring expansion or the formation of a new ring.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the next step. After product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, then product 3 is heated to form product 4.

SO3 in DMSO and pyridine is a common condition for the sulfonylation of alcohols, amines, or other nucleophilic groups. So, product 2 must have a nucleophilic group, like an -OH or an amine. Wait, but the starting materials don't have OH groups, unless they were formed in the previous steps.

Wait, maybe during the acid treatment, a ring is opened, leading to an alcohol or some other functional group. Alternatively, perhaps elimination forms an epoxide, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, if product 1 has some brominated substituents, and product 2 has those converted to double bonds, perhaps product 2 contains an alkene that can undergo some further reaction.

Wait, but when product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine, perhaps in a sulfonation reaction, any available hydroxyl groups are being sulfonated. So product 2 might have hydroxyl groups that become sulfonated in product 3.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has aromatic rings, and the SO3 is sulfonating those rings.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think of this as a series of reactions leading to a polycyclic structure with certain functional groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial Diels-Alder reaction forms a bridged bicyclic structure with substituents, which are then modified in each step.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me try to imagine the structures.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's norbornadiene with a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the structure has two double bonds at positions 2 and 5.

When it reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. NaI is a source of iodide ions, which can be a good nucleophile. So perhaps this is an iodide substitution reaction.

Wait, but the starting material has an ether group, which is a good leaving group under certain conditions. The tert-butoxy group is a very good leaving group, but typically requires acidic conditions for substitution. But in this case, perhaps the reaction is an SN2 substitution at the bridgehead, which is sterically hindered, so maybe that's unlikely. Or perhaps it's an elimination reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophiles are adding across the double bonds of norbornadiene via Diels-Alder. Each dienophile has two substituents, so perhaps each dienophile adds across one double bond, leading to a diadduct.

Wait, but the starting material has two double bonds, so each dienophile could add to each double bond. So with two equivalents, two Diels-Alder adducts would form. So product 1 would have two new rings added from the dienophiles.

Then, treating with H2SO4 (aqueous) would perhaps cause elimination of some groups, maybe the bromides. So if product 1 has CH2Br substituents, perhaps they lose HBr and form double bonds, leading to more conjugated structures.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. SO3 is a sulfonating agent. So product 2 must have a nucleophilic group, like an -OH, which would react with SO3 to form a sulfonic acid group.

Alternatively, perhaps during the acid treatment (H2SO4), some epoxide formation occurs, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps in the first step, the Diels-Alder reaction adds the dienophiles across the double bonds, resulting in substituents that are CH2Br groups attached to the norbornane structure.

Then, in the acid treatment, these CH2Br groups undergo elimination, losing HBr and forming double bonds. So product 2 would have new double bonds where the CH2Br groups were.

Then, product 2, which now has double bonds, is treated with SO3, which might not react directly with double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has some hydroxyl groups. Wait, where would the -OH groups come from? Maybe during the elimination, some hydroxyl groups are formed.

Wait, when CH2Br groups are eliminated, perhaps the adjacent C-H bonds break, and OH groups are formed. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to formation of alkenes without any OH groups.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on that. Let me try to think about the next step. Product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. SO3 is a sulfonic acid group donor. So if product 2 has an -OH group, it would react with SO3 to form a sulfonate ester or sulfonic acid.

Then, heating product 3 at 150°C forms product 4. Heating often leads to elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation or other eliminations, or possibly rearrangements.

But perhaps product 4 is the result of some cyclization or ring formation. Alternatively, maybe the sulfonate group is removed or undergoes some reaction.

But I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should try to draw a possible structure for product 4 and then count the distinct H's.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the overall reaction is leading towards the formation of a compound with multiple rings and substituents, and the number of chemically distinct H's is determined by symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is a highly symmetric structure, leading to a smaller number of distinct H's.

Wait, let me think about the steps again. The first step is Diels-Alder reactions, adding two dienophiles with CH2Br groups. Then, acid treatment causes elimination of HBr, forming double bonds. Then, sulfonation adds a SO3 group. Finally, heating might cause some cyclization or elimination.

Wait, another thought: after Diels-Alder, product 1 has two CH2Br substituents from each dienophile. Then, in acidic conditions, each CH2Br might lose HBr, forming a double bond. So if you have two CH2Br groups adjacent, you might get a double bond between them.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2Br groups are at positions that, upon elimination, form new rings. For example, in a bicyclic system, elimination could bridge two parts, forming a new ring.

Then, product 2 would have new rings or double bonds from the elimination. Then, treating with SO3 would sulfonate any -OH groups, but if product 2 has -OH groups in specific positions, product 3 would have those as sulfonate groups.

Then, heating product 3 could cause sulfonate groups to leave, leading to new ring formation or elimination.

Hmm, perhaps the final product is a highly bridged bicyclic or polycyclic compound with several rings, leading to a structure where the number of distinct H's is limited.

Wait, let me think about the options given. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7. So the answer is one of these.

I think the final product might be a norbornene derivative with several substituents, but the structure is such that many H's are equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, another angle. The initial compound is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene with two double bonds. After the Diels-Alder, perhaps each double bond is converted into a six-membered ring, adding substituents.

Wait, perhaps each dienophile adds across each double bond of the norbornadiene. So each dienophile's double bond reacts with one double bond of the norbornadiene, leading to two new six-membered rings attached to the norbornane structure.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the norbornadiene is the diene, and each dienophile's double bond is the dienophile, leading to two Diels-Alder adducts.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is a compound where each of the two dienophiles has added across the norbornadiene's double bonds, leading to two new six-membered rings attached.

Then, in product 2, the CH2Br groups are eliminated to form double bonds, perhaps leading to a structure with more aromatic or conjugated double bonds.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3, which might sulfonate any available -OH groups, leading to a sulfonated product 3.

Finally, heating product 3 could lead to the loss of the sulfonate group and form a new ring, resulting in a highly bridged structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is part of a ring that, upon heating, undergoes elimination to form a double bond or a new ring.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's challenging. Let me think about the possible number of distinct H's.

In norbornene derivatives, the number of distinct H's can vary based on substitution. For example, in norbornene itself, there are 7 distinct H's, but with substituents, this can change.

Wait, but the final product after all these reactions might have multiple rings and substituents, leading to a structure where some H's are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cubane-like structure, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the final product is a compound with two bridged rings and some symmetry, leading to a limited number of distinct H's.

If the structure is symmetric, the number of distinct H's can be low. For example, if there are two equivalent rings, each with the same substituents, the H's on each ring would be equivalent.

Wait, but considering the options, the answer is likely D)7.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think: if the final structure is a norbornane system with several substituents arranged symmetrically, each substituent contributing a certain number of H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final structure is a compound like adamantane, which has multiple equivalent H's. But adamantane typically has 12 equivalent H's, so that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a structure with several fused rings, each with a certain number of unique H environments.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress. Let me try to think about each step again.

1. First reaction: Diels-Alder between norbornadiene and two dienophiles, each with CH2Br substituents.

This would add two dienophiles across the two double bonds of the norbornadiene, leading to a structure where each dienophile has added to each double bond, creating two new rings with CH2Br groups.

2. Acid treatment (H2SO4): This would protonate any leaving groups and cause elimination, probably of HBr from the CH2Br groups, leading to the formation of double bonds.

So product 2 would have two new double bonds where the CH2Br groups were, perhaps leading to a more conjugated system.

3. Treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO: This would sulfonate any available -OH groups. But where would the -OH groups come from? Maybe during the elimination in step 2, some -OH groups are formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to formation of epoxides, but more likely, it's a dehydrohalogenation, forming alkenes.

Wait, perhaps during step 2, the CH2Br groups are eliminated, forming double bonds, but without any -OH groups. Then, where does the -OH come from for sulfonation in step 3?

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 has some hydroxyl groups that are present after the Diels-Alder. But that seems less likely.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the sequence leading to the final product. 

After all steps, including heating, the product 4 would be the result of all these modifications. The number of chemically distinct H's would depend on the symmetry of the molecule.

If the final structure is highly symmetric, like having mirror planes or multiple planes of symmetry, the number of distinct H's would be low.

Perhaps the final product is a compound with several equivalent environments for the H's. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, some H's on either side would be equivalent.

Wait, considering that the starting material and the dienophiles are symmetric in some way, the final product might inherit that symmetry, leading to a limited number of distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final structure is similar to cubane, but cubane's H's are all equivalent, which would give a count of 1. But that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a norbornene derivative with several substituents arranged symmetrically, leading to a certain number of distinct H's.

Wait, perhaps the final product has two bridges, leading to a structure where each bridge has equivalent H's, thus reducing the total count.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Given the options, and considering the steps, I'm going to make an educated guess.

The starting material has a certain number of H's. After each step, some H's are lost (due to elimination or substitution), and new H's may be formed or changed.

But perhaps the final product has multiple equivalent H environments. For instance, if the structure has several identical substituents arranged symmetrically, each substituent's H's would be equivalent.

Wait, the options are 8,4,10,7. I'm thinking that the answer is likely D)7. Because norbornene derivatives often have 7 distinct H's. But if substituents are added symmetrically, that number could change.

Alternatively, perhaps the final structure is a compound with 7 distinct H's.

Another angle: the final product is a compound with two identical substituents, each contributing three equivalent H's, and the main structure contributing four more unique H's. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the final product has a structure where each substituent contributes some equivalent H's, and the main rings contribute others. Maybe the total is 7.

I think the answer is D)7.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which undergoes Diels-Alder reactions with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene in the presence of sodium iodide. The norbornadiene acts as a diene, and the cyclohexadiene derivatives act as dienophiles, leading to a bicyclic structure with substituents. The reaction conditions suggest that two Diels-Alder adducts form, each attaching to one of the double bonds in the norbornadiene system.

In the next step, the product is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, which likely causes elimination of HBr from the CH2Br groups, forming new double bonds and potentially altering the structure to create a more conjugated or aromatic system. This step likely results in a product with new double bonds or rings.

The third step involves treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, which is a sulfonation reaction. This suggests that product 2 contains nucleophilic groups, such as hydroxyl (-OH) groups, which react with SO3 to form sulfonic acid groups. The sulfonation modifies the structure further, introducing new functional groups.

Finally, heating product 3 at 150°C leads to the formation of product 4. This step likely involves rearrangement, elimination, or cyclization, resulting in a final structure with a specific arrangement of rings and substituents. The symmetry and arrangement of the substituents in the final product determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

Given the sequence of reactions and the transformations described, the final product is likely a highly symmetric polycyclic compound. The symmetry reduces the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Based on the reasoning and the options provided, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product is most consistent with **7**.

Answer: D
