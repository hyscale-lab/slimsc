Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about determining the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives me some data about their elemental abundances and their masses relative to the Sun. Let me try to break down the information.

First, the stars' masses: Star_1 is 1.5 times the Sun's mass, and Star_2 is 1.2 times. But wait, does the mass matter here? The problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe they're just extra info. Or perhaps they're relevant in the context of the methods used, but I'm not sure yet. Let me focus on the abundance data.

The abundances given are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, I need to remember what these notation mean. The square brackets mean logarithmic abundance ratios. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, is it? Actually, the general formula is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, it's the logarithm of (X/Y ratio in the star) divided by the same ratio in the Sun. So, for example, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H in star) divided by (Fe/H in Sun). 

Wait, but in the Sun, [Fe/H] would be zero because it's the reference. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is zero. That makes sense. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which means the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's. And for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0, so Mg is same as Sun.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5
12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think
