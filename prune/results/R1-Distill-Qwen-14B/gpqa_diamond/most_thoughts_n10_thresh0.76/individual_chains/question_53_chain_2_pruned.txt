Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for this compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so it's probably something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that's a key clue. Esters have carbonyl groups, which typically show a strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹. So the compound must have an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum data: there are six signals. Let's categorize them. The first two are aromatic protons, which suggests that the ring isn't a simple para-substituted benzene because that would have fewer signals. Wait, di-substituted can be ortho, meta, or para. For para, you'd have two equivalent protons on each ring position, leading to two sets, each as a doublet perhaps. But the NMR shows two aromatic signals, which might mean that each substituent is in such a position that the ring has two distinct environments for the aromatic protons. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is ortho to the other, leading to different environments.

Then, two signals are from vinyl-H. A vinyl group is like CH₂=CH-, so the protons on the double bond. The fact that one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets suggests some coupling. Maybe the vinyl group is part of an ester, like an acyl group. For example, in an ester like CH₂CH₂COO-, but wait, esters can have structures like R-O-CO-O-R? No, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So maybe the substituent is something like an ester where one part is a vinyl group, like maybe a vinyl ester. Wait, could it be something like CH₂CH₂COO-R attached to the ring?

Wait, another thought: the presence of vinyl protons (i.e., double bond protons) in the NMR. So perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group. Or maybe the substituent is a group that has a double bond, like an ester where the R group has a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methoxyl group attached to a vinyl group, but I'm not sure.

The other two signals are for -CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. Or perhaps two equivalent methyl groups? Wait, the question says two signals corresponding to –CH3. So they're not equivalent, meaning maybe they're in different environments. So maybe two different methyl groups attached somewhere.

And importantly, there are no signals for –CH₂ groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups (CH₂). So any part of the structure that would have CH₂ must be absent.

Let me think about the possible structure. Since there's an ester group, the substituents on the benzene ring are likely an ester group and something else. Wait, no, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents. One of them is an ester group, perhaps. Or maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a different group.

Wait, the aromatic ring with two substituents could be like an o-, m-, p- disubstituted benzene. Let's consider the substituents. One is an ester group, which would have the structure R-O-CO- attached to the ring. The other substituent might be something else, perhaps a vinyl group or another group that would account for the NMR signals.

Wait, the NMR has six signals in total. Let's think about each part:

1. Two aromatic H signals: So the ring has two sets of aromatic protons. That would happen if the substituents are in the meta or para positions. For example, if substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be in two sets (each substituent's adjacent Hs). Alternatively, if the substituents are in ortho positions, maybe the aromatic Hs are in two environments.

2. Two vinyl H signals
