Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition between states. Hmm, let's see what it's all about. The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, selection rules. Right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but for hydrogen, the main ones are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh wait, no, more precisely, for dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l changes by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m changes by 0, ±1. Also, the principal quantum number n can change, but with certain constraints based on the energy levels.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (which is an s orbital), m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So we're going from a 3s state to a 1s state. Since the transition is via two dipole steps, that means it's a two-photon process, right? So the electron would make two transitions, each involving a dipole (so each step must follow the selection rules).

Let's think about the possible intermediate states. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. For a dipole transition, from l=0, the next possible l is l=1, since Δl=±1. So first transition could go from l=0 to l=1. So the first step could be |3,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but in the options, the first step goes to either |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. Wait, but wait, n changes as well. So the first transition can't just change l but also n. So when the electron drops from n=3, it can go to a lower n. But the final state is n=1. So if it's two transitions, the first step must go from
