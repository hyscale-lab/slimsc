Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe some constants are at their usual values.

I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can lose three protons, each with their own Ka values. The given Ka values are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12. So the main species in solution would depend on the pH, but since we're mixing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, I think this is a buffer solution.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K+ H2PO4^-. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium phosphate. Its formula is Na+ HPO4^2- · 2H2O. When it dissolves, it gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton) to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can act as an acid to become PO4^3- but that's a much weaker acid. So the buffer here is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2- or maybe PO4^3-? No, wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's deprotonated once, it's H2PO4^-, twice is HPO4^2-, thrice is PO4^3-. So orthophosphate might refer to H3PO4, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe in this context, it's referring to the HPO4^2- ion because that's the main species in a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Let me think. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. The phosphate ion is PO4^3-, but maybe that's not relevant here. Alternatively, orthophosphate might be referring to the HPO4^2- ion as the orthophosphate ion. I think that's more likely because in the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the HPO4^2- is a conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

So the buffer system is H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). So the concentration of HPO4^2- would be part of the solution.

But wait, the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Maybe that's HPO4^2-? Because H2PO4^- is the hydrogen phosphate ion, and HPO4^2- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. But 'orthophosphate' usually refers to the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-, but that's not the case here. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'orthophosphate' in this context refers to the H3PO4 molecules. But in the solution, we don't have much H3PO4 because the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Let's look at the problem
