Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me see if I can work through it step by step. 

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are A to D, each with different r values. 

Wait, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, the state can be represented in a three-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere. Each qubit state corresponds to a point on this sphere.

So, what's the structure of the density matrix given here? Let me write it out. 

The density matrix ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). If I compute that, expanding each term:

|0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 at position (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 at (2,2). So adding them together gives a 2x2 diagonal matrix with [1,0; 0,1]. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the matrix becomes [0.5, 0; 0, 0.5]. 

Wait, but that's the identity matrix scaled by 1/2. That looks familiar. I think this state is a completely mixed state. Because a completely mixed state for a qubit is indeed (I + 0)/2, where I is the identity matrix. Or wait, no, wait, the general form for a density matrix of a mixed state which is maximally mixed is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) / 2. Oh right, that's exactly what this is. So this is the maximally mixed state.

Now, for a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture. The maximally mixed state for a qubit is the completely mixed state, which lies at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere has a radius of 1, the center is at (0,0,0). 

Wait, but how does the Bloch vector come into play here? The Bloch vector r represents a qubit state. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, when ρ is a mixed state, the Bloch vector has a certain magnitude. 

For a completely mixed state, the density matrix is (I)/2, because the identity is the sum of the projectors, each scaled by 1/2. But wait, the identity matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|), so when you have ρ = (I)/2, that's the maximally mixed state. 

In terms of the Bloch vector, the density matrix ρ can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in R^
