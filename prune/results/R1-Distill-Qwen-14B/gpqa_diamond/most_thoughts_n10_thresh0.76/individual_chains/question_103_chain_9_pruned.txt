Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl ring has a bromo group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5. The ethan-1-one part means that there's a ketone (C=O) attached to the benzene ring at position 1, right? Wait, no, the numberingâ€”actually, ethan-1-one would have the ketone at the first carbon of the ethane. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are on the benzene ring, so perhaps the structure is more like phenyl with substituents at positions 3 and 5, and the ketone is attached to the ring.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one is a two-carbon chain with the ketone on the first carbon. So the structure would be:

O
||
C - (Ph group: benzene with substituents at 3 and 5 positions)

So, the benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the benzene has substituents at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro).

So the target molecule is a ketone where the carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring that has bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5.

Now, the goal is to figure out the correct reaction steps to get there from benzene.

I remember that electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions are key here. The substituents' positions (ortho, meta, para) depend on the directing groups.

So, starting with benzene, I need to add substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think about the substituents needed: nitro groups and bromo groups, and then a ketone (which comes from an acetyl group, perhaps via Friedel-Crafts acylation).

But wait, where would each substituent go? Nitro groups are meta directors. Bromine can be either ortho/para or meta, depending on how it's introduced. Acetyl groups are activating and meta directors.

Wait, but the target has two nitro groups? Wait, no: no, target has a nitro (NO2) and a bromo (Br). Wait, no, the target has one nitro and one bromo, along with the ketone.

Wait, wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benzene ring has bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone.

Wait, so the ketone is attached to position 1 of the benzene ring (since the substituents are at 3 and 5). So if the ketone is at position 1, then bromo is at position 3 (which is meta to the ketone, which is an
