Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading through the question and the reaction steps carefully. 

The problem is about a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, no, cyclopropane's formula is C3H6 too. Hmm, but propene is more common in such reaction sequences. I think the first step is bromination in CCl4, which suggests an addition reaction. So, if A is propene, then bromination would add Br2 across the double bond.

So, A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3). When propene undergoes bromination in CCl4, which is a non-polar solvent, it's probably a dibromination via the bromonium ion mechanism. Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, addition across the double bond would give 1,2-dibromopropane, right? So Compound B would be CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? Wait, wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So it would become CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? So structure is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would add across the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane. So the structure would be CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, right? So the structure is CH2=CH-CH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so it would become CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. I remember that in such conditions, elimination reactions happen. So with 1,2-dibromopropane and alcoholic KOH, which is a dehydrohalogenation reaction. But wait, 1,2-dibromopropane would have two adjacent bromines. So when KOH attacks, it would eliminate two HBr molecules. So what's the product? Let's think: when adjacent Br atoms are present, eliminating two HBr's would form an alkene. The structure would be CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it. Starting from CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, when treated with alcoholic KOH, the base would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since both Brs are on adjacent carbons, the elimination would produce 1-propene or 2-propene? Wait, wait. The structure after elimination would be CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, elimination from CH2Br-CHBr-CH3 would lead to the formation of CH2=CH-CH3.
