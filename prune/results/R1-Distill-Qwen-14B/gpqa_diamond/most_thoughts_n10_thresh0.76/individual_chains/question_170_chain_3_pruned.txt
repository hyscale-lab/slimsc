Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I need to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, that's a two-component vector, right? So it's a spinor. I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin states are represented by these two-component vectors, often called spin-up and spin-down states. So the state given is a vector (3i, 4), which I can write as a column vector: [3i; 4].

The question is about the expectation value of S_y. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average you'd measure if you measured S_y many times on identically prepared systems. The formula for expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator S_y, then multiplied by the state vector again. So ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† σ_y ħ/2 ψ, wait, no, wait. Wait, the Pauli matrices are the σ matrices, and the spin operators are (ħ/2) times those matrices. So S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, let me get that right. The spin operator S_y is defined as (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma-y matrix. So σ_y is given as:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

The expectation value is computed as ψ† S_y ψ. So I need to compute ψ† times S_y times ψ.

Let me write down the components. The state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ† would be the conjugate transpose, which for [3i,4], the conjugate is [-3i,4] and the transpose is a row vector, so ψ† is [-3i, 4].

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait: the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 is 4 (since it's real). So ψ† is [-3i, 4].

So putting it all together, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ψ† * S_y * ψ. Let's compute each part.

First, S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -
