Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that means the benzene ring has two substituents attached. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption bands, usually around 1730-1750 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Also, esters have an absorption around 1250-1050 cm^-1 for the C-O stretch. So that's confirmed; the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break down what each part means. 

The first part says two signals correspond to aromatic-H. A benzene ring with two substituents can have different substitution patterns. If it's para-substituted, the aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving a singlet. But if it's ortho or meta, the protons would split into different signals. Wait, but if it's di-substituted, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring might have two equivalent protons or maybe more. Alternatively, if it's para, the ring could have two sets of equivalent protons. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here, maybe I need to think more.

Wait, the question says two signals for aromatic-H. Let's think about possible substitution patterns. If the substituents are para, then the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons. For example, if it's two substituents opposite each other, the ring would have two equivalent H's on each adjacent carbon, but wait, no. Wait, in para substitution, the ring would have two substituents opposite. The aromatic H's would be in two sets of two each. So for example, maybe two doublets or something else. But then, what would the splitting look like?

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the ortho positions, the aromatic protons would not be equivalent. Let me think: in ortho substitution, the substituents are adjacent. So the ring would have two substituents next to each other, leading to three different types of H's? No, wait, in a di-substituted benzene with substituents in ortho, the ring would have two protons adjacent to substituents, and two on the other side. Wait, maybe it's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are in a para substitution, leading to two sets of equivalent H's. So in that case, two signals for aromatic H would make sense.

But wait, the aromatic H's are two signals, which could mean two distinct environments. So if the substituents are in the meta positions, maybe the ring has two types of aromatic H's. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2,3,5-tetra substitution or something else. Hmm, maybe I should think about the other parts of the NMR first.

The NMR also shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl Hs are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Also
