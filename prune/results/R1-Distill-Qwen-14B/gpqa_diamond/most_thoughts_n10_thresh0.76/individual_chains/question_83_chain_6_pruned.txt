Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details about titrations. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm. I think I should start by figuring out what the diluted solution's concentration is. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Oh right, the dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2.

So, initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration (M2) should be (M1 * V1) / (V1 + V2) = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04.

Calculating that: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M. Okay, that makes sense.

Wait, the next step is the titration with NaOH. So, the initial solution we're titrating is 0.025 M acetic acid. The titrant is 0.1 M NaOH. So, I need to find two pH values: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

I think I should first calculate the equivalence point. Because at equivalence, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH. So, let's find out how much NaOH is needed to reach that point.

The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. So, the mole ratio is 1:1.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles. So, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the first part of the question is about 25% titration. So, 25% of the equivalence volume is 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So, at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Now, I need to calculate the pH at this point and at the equivalence point.

Let's tackle the equivalence point first because that's often a simpler calculation. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted into its conjugate base, acetate ions. So, the solution will be a buffer solution of acetate ions in water, which makes it basic. But wait, since we have a weak base, the solution will be basic, but we'll have to calculate the pH using the Kb of acetate.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the concentration of the acetate ions at the equivalence point. Let's see: the volume of the solution at equivalence is the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³), so that's 50 cm³ (0
