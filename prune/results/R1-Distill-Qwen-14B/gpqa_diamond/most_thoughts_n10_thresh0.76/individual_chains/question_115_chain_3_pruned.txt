Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Hmm, let me read it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, okay. So the setup is that an electron and a positron are moving towards each other on a straight line. They collide and annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, which probably means they have the same frequency and wavelength since energy of a photon is E = hf. 

Since they produce two photons, and the total energy and momentum must be conserved, I'll have to think about conservation laws here. The initial momentum comes from the electron and positron, and the final momentum comes from the two photons.

But wait, what's the rest mass of the electron and positron? Oh right, they are the same because a positron is just the antimatter counterpart of an electron. The rest mass energy is mc², which for electrons is about 0.511 MeV each. But since they annihilate, their rest mass energy will contribute to the photons.

Wait, but the Lorentz factor affects the total energy. Lorentz factor gamma is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy of each particle before collision is gamma * m_e c².

So let me compute the energies of the electron and positron.

Electron: gamma is 4, so energy E_e = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV.

Positron: gamma is 2, so E_p = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

Wait, but positron is moving in the opposite direction. So the electron is moving left to right, and the positron right to left? Or wait, no. Wait, the question says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So the electron is moving to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so also to the left? Or perhaps I got that wrong.
