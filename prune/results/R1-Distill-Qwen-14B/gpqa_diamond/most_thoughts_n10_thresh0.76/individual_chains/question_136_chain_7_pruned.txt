Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything from my classes. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, right. So I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is spreading out or converging at a point. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. Oh wait, yes, the Divergence Theorem! It says that the volume integral of ∇·f is equal to the surface integral of f·n over the surface, where n is the outward normal vector.

Wait, but in this case, the field f(r) is radial and only has a radial component. So f(r) = (F_r) er, where er is the unit radial vector. Since the magnitude is 1/r², F_r must be 1/r².

So the divergence of f in spherical coordinates. I think the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) [d(r² F_r)/dr] + (1/(r sinθ)) [d(F_θ sinθ)/dθ] + (1/(r sinθ)) [d F_φ/dφ]. But since f has only radial component, the other components F_θ and F_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d(r² F_r)/dr.

Let me compute that. F_r is 1/r², so r² F_r is r² * (1/r²) = 1. Then the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = 0? Wait, that can't be right because if the divergence is zero everywhere inside except maybe at the origin.

Wait, but wait, the divergence is zero except at r=0. Because when r is not zero, the divergence is zero. But at r=0, the field isn't defined since f would be infinite there.

So if the divergence is zero in the volume except at the origin, then the integral over the volume would be zero except maybe at the origin. But wait
