Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem involves a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 could be propene or cyclopropane. But wait, propene is more common and typically has that formula. Let's think about each step.

Step 1: Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of CCl4 to form B. Bromination in CCl4 usually refers to an addition reaction, probably with alkenes. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add bromine across the double bond. So B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe 1-bromo-1-propene? No, wait. Propene has a structure CH2=CH2CH3. When bromine adds across the double bond, it would form 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3). So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Step 2: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base. When a dibromide reacts with a strong base, it's likely an elimination reaction. So B, which is 1,2-dibromopropane, would eliminate HBr twice. Wait, but the structure of B is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When KOH is present, each Br could deprotonate, leading to elimination. Wait, elimination usually forms alkenes. So two eliminations would happen, but wait, 1,2-dibromide would eliminate two HBr molecules, right? So the product would be propene again? Or maybe a different structure. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. When 1,2-dibromide reacts with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules to form an alkene. So 1,2-dibromopropane â†’ CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3. How would elimination proceed?

Elimination typically occurs when a base abstracts a proton adjacent to a leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond. So in 1,2-dibromide, each Br is on adjacent carbons. So when KOH attacks, the first elimination would
