Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think it through. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such configurations often involves considering induced charges and how they affect the potential.

Alright, let's break it down. The setup is a conducting sphere of radius R that's grounded. So, when the charge q is placed a distance d from the center, the sphere must respond by inducing charges on its surface. Because it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface should be zero. Wait, right, because grounding allows charges to flow until the potential is the same as the Earth (which is considered zero).

So, the sphere being a conductor means the charges will be on the surface. The charge q will induce an opposite charge on the sphere's surface. But wait, no. Wait, if the sphere is neutral to begin with, placing a positive charge q nearby would cause the side closer to q to have negative charges (attracted by q), and the opposite side would have positive charges. But since the sphere is grounded, electrons can flow in or out. Let me think: if q is positive, the sphere's nearby electrons are attracted to that side, so that side becomes negative. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can leave, but in this case, since the sphere is neutral, the induced charges must balance.

Wait, no. If the sphere is neutral, the induced charges consist of equal + and - charges. But when it's grounded, the net charge on
