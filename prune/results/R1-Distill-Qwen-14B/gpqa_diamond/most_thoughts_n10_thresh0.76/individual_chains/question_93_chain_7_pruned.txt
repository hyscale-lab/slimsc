Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this qPCR question. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He used serially diluted controls and ran three technical replicates each. The qPCR efficiency was 100%, which I think means it's perfect, right? The R² was 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3. 

Looking at the results, each concentration has three Ct values. For example, 100,000 copies have Cts around 34, then it goes down by about 4 when the concentration drops tenfold each time. Wait, but wait, in qPCR, lower Ct means more copies because you reach the threshold faster. So higher concentrations should have lower Ct values. Oh wait wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, higher starting quantity should lead to reaching threshold sooner, so lower Ct. So the Ct values should decrease as the concentration increases. But looking at the data given, the Ct is higher for higher concentrations. Wait, that can't be right. Because when you have more copies, you hit the threshold earlier, so Ct should be lower.

Wait hold on, the concentrations go from 100000 down to 10, and the Cts go from 33.9 up to 20.7. So when the concentration is higher (100000), the Ct is higher. That's the opposite of what I expected. That's a problem. Because higher starting quantity should mean lower Ct. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the data. Let me read again. The first line says at 100,000 copies per µl, the triplicates are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. Then at 10,000, the Cts are 30.6, etc., which are lower. So they're lower Ct for lower concentrations? That's the reverse of how it's supposed to be. Because when you have more copies, you reach the threshold faster, so lower Ct. So if the higher concentration (100,000) has Ct ~34, but lower concentration (10,000) has Ct ~30, that's the opposite of the expected trend. 

So why would that happen? Because the Ct values are higher when there's a higher concentration, that's not right. So that suggests that maybe the data is inverted. But wait, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. So the question is asking why these results don't align as expected.

The options are:

A) qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples. No, that's not right. qPCR is used for quantification, so A is incorrect.

B) Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples. That sounds possible. Because in this case, higher concentrations are giving higher Ct values, which is opposite. So the Ct isn't reflecting the quantity.

C) Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, what does
