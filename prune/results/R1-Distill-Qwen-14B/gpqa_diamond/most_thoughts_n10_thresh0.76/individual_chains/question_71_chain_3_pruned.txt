Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets using the TTV method. Wait, TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? I remember that's a technique used to detect exoplanets by looking at the variations in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But wait, I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. The question is more about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets, so maybe I can set that aside for now.

The problem states that there are five exoplanets designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5. They are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, the periods are in proportion 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, and 5. Let me think about how that translates to actual periods. Like, if Planet_1 has a period P, then Planet_2 has 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. Okay, that makes sense.

The question is asking about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, so albedo shouldn't affect the ratio. Equilibrium temperature is governed by the energy balance, so I think the formula involves the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), where L is luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star. But since all planets orbit the same star, L and σ are constants. So the temperature depends on the distance d.

But wait, how do the orbital periods relate to the distance? Oh, right! Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. Mathematically, P² ∝ a³. So, a³ = (G*M*S)/(4π²) * (P²), but since the star's mass (M) is the same for all these planets, the radius a is proportional to (P)^(2/3). So a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, the distance a of each planet is proportional to P^(2/3). Therefore, when comparing two planets, the ratio of their distances would be (P_i / P_j)^(2/3). But since the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the distance, the temperature ratio would be (a_j / a_i) = ( (P_j / P_i)^(2/3) )^(-1) ) = (P_i / P_j)^(2/3). Wait, wait, let me think again. Because T is inversely proportional to a^(1/2). Wait no, wait: Let me go back.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)} ), where R_star is the star's radius. But if we ignore R_star and focus on the a term, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So, T ∝ a^(-½). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T4 / T2 would be (a2 / a4)^(1/2).

But a is proportional to P^(2/3), right? Because a^3 ∝ P^2, so a ∝ P^(2/3). So a2 = (P2)^(2/3) and a4 = (P4)^(2/3). Therefore, a2 / a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So putting it together: T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(½) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(½) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, let me recheck that step. If a ∝ P^(2/3), then a2 = k * P2^(2/3), a4 = k * P4^(2/3), where k is a constant. So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

Then T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, perhaps I should write this more carefully. Let me define:

T ∝ 1/sqrt(a) → T = C / sqrt(a), where C is a constant.

So, T4 = C / sqrt(a4), T2 = C / sqrt(a2).

So T4 / T2 = sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a4) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

Since a2 = (P2)^(2/3) * k, a4 = (P4)^(2/3) *k.

So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

Thus, sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, no, because T4 is the temperature of Planet_4. Wait, no, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if a4 is larger than a2, then T4 is smaller than T2. So T4 is lower than T2, which makes sense if Planet_4 is further out.

Wait, but let me get back. The ratio T4 / T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). Wait, in the problem, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_2's period is 2, Planet_4 is 3.5. So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714. So (4/7)^(1/3) is the cube root of 4/7.

What's that approximately? Let me compute that.

4/7 is approximately 0.5714.

The cube root of 0.5714. Let's think: cube of 0.8 is 0.512, cube of
