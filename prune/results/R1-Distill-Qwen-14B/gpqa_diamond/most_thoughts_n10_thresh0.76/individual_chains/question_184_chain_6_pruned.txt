Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about figuring out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, A through D, each with a series of steps. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break that down. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. 

Wait, numbering: in benzene, the positions are relative. The substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Wait, that's a meta arrangement? Or maybe ortho? Let me think. If ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2 (which is adjacent), and nitro at 3 (which is next to 2), then the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern, which is a meta arrangement around the ring. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact numbering, but the main thing is the substituents are in three adjacent positions.

So, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let me list them: substituents are -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) at position X, tert-butyl at position Y, nitro at position Z. The goal is to get all three groups attached to the benzene ring in the correct positions.

Now, the starting material is benzene. So, we'll need to perform substitution reactions to add these groups. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions, and each step will add a substituent.

But wait, the order of adding substituents can matter because each substituent can direct the next substitution. So, the directing effects of each group will influence where the next substituent is added.

Let me think about the directing effects of each functional group:

- Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3): This is an activating group (since it's an ether, O- is electron-donating through resonance), and it's an ortho/para director. So, it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.

- tert-Butyl group: This is a bulky alkyl group which is a deactivating (through inductive effect, since it's a +I group but can't donate electrons via resonance) but activating because alkyl groups are electron-releasing. Wait, no: alkyl groups are deactivating by inductive effect (since they're electron-donating through sigma bonds, but aren't as strong as activating groups like -OCH3). Wait, actually, alkyl groups are activating because they donate electrons through sigma bonds, which makes the ring more reactive. So tert-butyl is an activating group, but being bulky, it's a strong activating group. It's an ortho/para director because of its steric hindrance. Wait, no, steric hindrance actually makes meta substitution more favorable sometimes, but for tert-butyl, which is bulky, the main effect is that it's a strong activating group, but due to steric hindrance, it directs incoming groups to the para position. Wait, no, I think that bulky substituents can lead to para preference because the ortho positions are crowded. So, tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director but tends to favor para due to steric reasons.

- Nitro group (-NO2): This is a strong deactivating group (due to -I effect), making the ring less reactive. It's a meta director because the nitro group withdraws electrons through resonance and inductive effects, so the next substitution occurs meta to it.

So, the substituents have different directing effects. The key is to plan the order of substitution such that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing substituents.

Let me sketch the structure. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Wait, numbering in benzene is such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, maybe I should assign the positions correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the substituents being added in a certain order. Let me think about the best order to add these groups.

I think the best approach is to add the nitro group last because it's a meta director, which could complicate the addition of other groups. Alternatively, maybe adding the nitro group first, then the ethoxy, then the tert-butyl. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, let's consider the substituents and their activating or deactivating nature. Benzene can be nitrated, which is a deactivating step. Once a nitro group is present, the ring becomes less reactive, so the next substitution would be harder. So perhaps nitration should be done after adding an activating group.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So perhaps we can add it after another substituent that directs the nitro group to the correct position.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the tert-butyl group first. Because it's a strong activating group. Then, adding the ethoxy group, which is also activating. Then, adding nitro, which is deactivating, but in the correct position.

Wait, but adding nitro as the last step
