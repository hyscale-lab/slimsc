Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking down the information given.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, and the melting point of B is near 277 K. 

Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question is about finding the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

Hmm. Let me try to piece this together.

First, let's think about the reaction and the products. Violent reaction with a liquid... what liquids react violently? Maybe something like water or an acid. Let's think about what could cause a violent reaction. Oh, like metals reacting with acids. For example, sodium reacting with water. But that's a thought.

Wait, gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecule must be an isotope of a noble gas where each atom has equal p and n. Let's think: for example, Helium is He, with 2 protons and 2 neutrons in He-4. Or maybe Carbon-12, but that's not a noble gas. Alternatively, Argon-40? Wait, but a molecule of W, so perhaps a diatomic gas like O2, N2, but wait, the molecule would have same number of protons and neutrons per atom. Wait, but the question says the gas's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So each molecule is made of atoms where each atom has p = n. So like He (He has 2 protons, 2 neutrons in He-4). So the gas is helium? But He is monoatomic. So if it's a molecule, maybe O2? No, because O has 8 protons each. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO2? No, that's not a monoatomic gas. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.

Wait, the molecule of gas W has same number of protons and neut
