Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting quasars with large clouds of neutral hydrogen. Hmm, I remember something about the Lyman alpha wavelength. Let me think.

The question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The Lyman alpha wavelength is around 1216 Angstroms. Oh right, that's in the ultraviolet range because I remember the Lyman series is for hydrogen transitions in the UV.

Wait, but wait. Ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV light because Earth's atmosphere absorbs it. So if the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, but our telescopes can't observe UV, what can we do? Oh, right! When the quasar is at a high redshift, the absorbed light from the hydrogen clouds might shift into the visible spectrum, which telescopes can detect.

So the Lyman alpha line is at about 121.6 nm (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm). But in the rest frame of the quasar, it's emitted at this UV wavelength. If the quasar is moving away (high redshift), this wavelength stretches. So we can detect the absorption line only if it's shifted into the visible range.

So the visible spectrum for us starts roughly around 400 nm (violet) up to about 700 nm (red). So the Lyman alpha needs to be redshifted into this range. Let's think about what redshift would cause 121.6 nm to reach 400 nm.

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. So z = (λ_obs - λ_emit) / λ_emit.

We want λ_obs to be at least 400 nm, because anything below that is UV which we can't see from the ground. So plugging in, z = (400 - 121.6) / 121.6.

Calculating that: 400 - 121.6 is 278.4. Divide by 121.6: 278.4 / 121.6 ≈ 2.2857. So z is about 2.286. So the minimum redshift is about 2.286. But wait, what if the quasar's own light is in the visible? Hmm, no, because the question is about the absorption from hydrogen clouds. So the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms, but when it's redshifted, that's when we see the absorption.

Wait, no. The quasars themselves emit light across the spectrum, but the question is about the clouds absorbing at Lyman alpha. So the background quasar's Lyman alpha photon is absorbed by the cloud, and the absorption line is observed. So, for the absorption to be in the optical, the redshift must bring the 1216 Angstrom line into optical wavelengths.

But wait, quasars themselves have a lot of emission, but in this case, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so we see
