Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. So, a supernova occurs in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames, which I think means they're not accelerating and can be considered as non-accelerating reference points.

The question is about finding the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, wait. No, actually, the wording says "when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame." So, from the ejecta's perspective, 50 seconds have gone by. But we need to find how much distance the ejecta has moved according to the galaxy's frame during that time.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. So, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Since they're both inertial frames, we can probably use the concept of relative velocity and time dilation, but wait, what's the exact setup here?

Wait, no, because the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So we're only dealing with their relative velocities and special relativity effects, perhaps. Let me think.

So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some velocity. Let's call that velocity 'v' in the galaxy's frame. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, this is a problem involving relative velocity. Oh right, because if two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed isn't just a simple addition if we're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light. But wait, 60,000 km/s is 0.06c (since c is about 300,000 km/s). So that's much less than the speed of light, so maybe we can treat it with classical mechanics for simplicity.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that it's non-relativistic, but perhaps since 60,000 km/s is 2% of c, maybe relativistic effects are negligible for this question. So maybe we can just use the classical velocity addition formula.

Wait, the correct way to relate the two velocities is using the
