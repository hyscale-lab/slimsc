Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for a given electron spin state.

The state is given as (3i, 4). Hmm, wait, I think that notation represents a two-component column vector. So in Dirac notation, it's probably |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. Right, because in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-element vectors since electrons have spin-1/2.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator. So for S_y, I need the operator for spin in the y-direction. Oh, right, the Pauli matrices come into play here. The spin operator for y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma_y matrix. Oh wait, the note in the question gives σ_y as a matrix:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ].

So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y. That matrix would then be:
(ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

To compute the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ, where † denotes the conjugate transpose.

So let's write out ψ and its conjugate transpose. ψ is [3i, 4]^T. The conjugate transpose, ψ†, would be [ -3, 4* ]? Wait, no, let's see. The components are 3i and 4. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4. But wait, in the conjugate transpose, each component is the conjugate and then transposed. So ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector [ -3, 4 ].

Wait, no. Wait, ψ is [3i; 4]. So ψ† is [3i*, 4* ] as a row vector. Since 3i* is -3i, and 4 is 4, so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait, no. 3i is 3 multiplied by i. Its complex conjugate is 3*(-i) = -3i. Oh wait, no! Wait, 3i is a purely imaginary number. So the conjugate is -3i. So yes, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So now, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

Let me write this as:

⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† * ( (ħ/2) * σ_y ) * ψ.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, let's compute σ_y * ψ. σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. When I multiply this matrix by the vector [3i; 4], I get:

First component: (0)*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = -4i.
Second component: (i)*(3i) + (0)*(4) = 3i². Since i² is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, multiply this by (ħ/2) to get the S_y * ψ, but actually, no. Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y, so when we compute S_y acting on ψ, it's (ħ/2) * σ_y * ψ, which is (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, but in the expectation value calculation, the order is ψ† (S_y) ψ, which is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ. Alternatively, since S_y is an operator, it's (S_y ψ) acting on ψ†.

Wait, no, the matrix multiplication is: ψ† is a row vector, S_y is a 2x2 matrix, and ψ is a column vector. So ψ† * S_y is a row vector, and then multiplied by ψ gives a scalar.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it as (ψ†) (S_y ψ) = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the product ψ† S_y ψ as the sum over the components.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute S_y multiplied by ψ first, then multiply by ψ†.

Let me compute S_y ψ:

S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
