Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about binary star systems and determining which one is more massive. 

Alright, the problem says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods. The periods are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. So the period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think is the orbital period of the binary system.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. In system_1, the RV variations have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. 

Wait, so each binary system has two stars orbiting around a common center of mass. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shifts of the stars as they move toward and away from us. The amplitude of the velocity is related to the mass of the companion. The more massive a star is, the smaller its velocity amplitude because it's moving less due to the gravitational pull of the other star. 

I remember that in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. Their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, velocity amplitude (K) is inversely related to the mass. The formula I think is something like K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because if one star is more massive, the other moves more, so higher K for the less massive star.

But wait, what about the masses and the period? I think the mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the observed velocities and the period to the masses of the stars. The formula I remember is: 

f(M) = ( (K1 * K2) / (P * (K1 + K2)^2) ) )^3 ) / (1 - e^2)^1.5 

But wait, for circular orbits, which I think we can assume here because the problem doesn't mention eccentricity. So the term (1-e²) becomes 1, and the mass function simplifies. 

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the formulas. Maybe a better approach is to think about the relationship between the velocities, masses, and the orbital period.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit each other with a certain period P. The center of mass requires that M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a1 and a2 are the orbital radii. So M1/M2 = a2/a1.

The velocity of each star is v1 = 2πa1 / P and v2 = 2πa2 / P. Since a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a, where a is the separation between the stars.

So substituting a1 and a2 into the velocity equations, we get:

v1 = (2π) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a / P 
v2 = (2π) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a / P 

But wait, the sum of the
