Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in a system, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes after each measurement. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a 3x1 matrix, right? So it's a three-dimensional vector. But wait, quantum states are usually represented as unit vectors, but this one doesn't look normalized. Let me check: the components are -1, 2, and 1. The square of the magnitude would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the state vector has a magnitude of sqrt(6). So to normalize it, I guess it's divided by sqrt(6), but the problem might not require that if the operators are given in a certain way. Hmm, maybe I should proceed without worrying about normalization because the operators might handle that.

Next, the operators for P and Q are given as 3x3 matrices. Let's write them out.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix. The eigenvalues of Q would be 1, 0, and -1. So when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The question is: if we first measure P and get 0, then measure Q and get -1, what's the probability of that happening?

Wait, no, the question says, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, noâ€”the order is measure P first, then Q. And we want the probability that P=0 and Q=-1.
