Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that spectrographs have different capabilities based on their design and the telescopes they're attached to.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. I need to figure out which ones are observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

Wait, the first thing I should note is the V magnitude limits. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V. But wait, wait—wait, when it says "brighter than," does that mean lower magnitudes (since lower magnitudes are brighter)? So anything with V mag ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag ≤16.

Oh wait, no, wait. The way it's phrased: "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Since higher magnitudes mean fainter, then if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would mean it's magnitude is less than or equal to 17? Or wait, no, the magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V magnitude 17 is fainter than one with 16, which is fainter than 15, etc. So the phrasing is a bit tricky.

Wait, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." But wait, the way magnitudes work is that lower numbers are brighter. So "brighter than 17 mag" would mean apparent V magnitude less than 17. Because if a star is brighter, its magnitude is smaller. So if a star has V mag 16, that's brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V ≤17.

Similarly, for HIRES, "brighter than 16 mag" means V ≤16. Because a star with V=16 is exactly at the limit, right? Or does it mean strictly brighter than 16, so V <16?

Wait, the question says "brighter than 17
