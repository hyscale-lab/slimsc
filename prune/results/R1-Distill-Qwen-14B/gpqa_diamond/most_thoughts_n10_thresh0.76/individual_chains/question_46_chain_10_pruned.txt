Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. It's about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I'm supposed to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups between alkenes. So, in this case, the starting material is an alkene, and Grubbs catalyst would facilitate the breaking and reforming of the double bonds.

The compound given is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but it's 3-methylpent-1-ene. Oh right, the structure should be CH2=CH-C(CH3)(CH2CH3). Wait, no, let me think again. Pent has five carbons. 3-methyl would be on the third carbon.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The formula for pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So, the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, the double bond is between 1 and 2. So, carbon 3 is the third carbon from the left. So adding a methyl group to carbon 3 would give CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, but wait, that would make the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. Alternatively, perhaps it's 3-methyl, so the substituents are arranged as such.

But wait, since the starting compound is racemic, that means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So, the structure must have a chiral center. Let me see:
