Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes under a hypothetical scenario. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, but what's the pp-III branch? I remember that in the Sun's fusion process, there are different branches. The proton-proton chain is the main one, and I think it has a couple of branches. Oh right, the pp-I and pp-II are part of the main proton-proton cycle. Then there's the pp-III branch, which involves heavier elements maybe? Or is it a different part of the fusion process?

So, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos. I'm pretty sure that in the Sun, most of the neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, but I'm not entirely certain. Oh right, the pp-III branch is actually part of the proton-proton chain as well. Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Another thought: the pp-III branch might involve reactions that produce beryllium-7, which then goes on to form lithium and helium. But wait, doesn't the main proton-proton chain produce a lot of high-energy neutrinos through the decay of Beryllium-7?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The pp-I branch is the main one, where two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton, and then a neutron and a positron and two neutrinos. Then, another branch, maybe the pp-II or pp-III, involves capturing a neutron or something else. Or perhaps the pp-III branch is the part where the deuterium captures another proton to form tritium, and then undergoes beta decay to helium-3. Oh wait, but that's the main process, isn't it? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up what the pp-III branch is. Oh wait, in the actual scenario, the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain that involves higher mass states. For example, in the pp-III branch, three protons fuse in a different way, perhaps via the so-called 'low' mass pathway. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the main
