Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D with numbers 1,3,5,0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated based on the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2. But wait, in this case, since the product is formed after a reaction, I need to figure out what the structure looks like after the reaction.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw the structure to visualize it better. So, it's a cyclohexene ring. The numbering is such that the carboxylic acid is at position 3 (since cyclohex-3-ene), but wait, position 3 is where the double bond is. Then, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-).

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is cyclohexene with a formyl group at C2 and a vinyl group at C5.

So the molecule is cyclohexene (so one ring and one double bond). Let me count the rings and double bonds for the initial structure. The cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. Then, the substituents are:

At C2: a formyl group (CHO)
At C5: a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

Wait, so the substituents are substituents on the ring, but the ring itself has a double bond. So the starting compound has one ring (from cyclohexene) and one double bond (since cyclohexene has a
