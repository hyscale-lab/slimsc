Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I need to figure out how long it would take for an astronaut to reach Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud traveling at a very high speed. Let me think about what I know.

First, the problem states that the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast—like, almost the speed of light. So I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play. Oh right, time dilation is a thing. So time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) will be less than the time measured by someone on Earth (coordinate time).

Wait, but I don't know the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh, right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think it's about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance D is around 160,000 light-years. But wait, maybe I should double-check that number. I'm pretty sure it's roughly 160,000 ly, but I'm not 100% certain. Anyway, I'll proceed with that.

So the time from Earth's perspective would be the distance divided by the speed. Let me calculate that. Let's denote the speed as v = 0.99999987c. So the time t_earth is D / v. Since D is in light-years and v is a fraction of c, the units should work out. So t_earth = 160,000 ly / 0.99999987 (because when you divide by a fraction of c, the c cancels out, leaving time in years).

Calculating that: 160,000 / 0.99999987. Let me approximate. 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so 160,000 / ~1 is about 160,000 years. But wait, wait a second. The astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifetime is 150 solar years. Oh, wait, so the astronaut's lifetime is about 150 years. So if it takes 160,000 years from Earth's frame, the astronaut would definitely die before reaching Earth. But wait, that's in Earth's frame. But due to time dilation, the astronaut's own experienced time would be less.

Wait, I'm confused. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the astronaut's experienced time, the proper time. So the proper time τ is given by the time dilation formula: τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because in the astronaut's frame, the Earth and the spacecraft are moving, but the distance would be contracted.

Alternatively, since the spaceship is moving at a high velocity, the distance they need to cover is shorter in their frame. So the time they experience is the contracted distance divided by their speed.

So for the contracted distance, D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So then, the time τ = D'
