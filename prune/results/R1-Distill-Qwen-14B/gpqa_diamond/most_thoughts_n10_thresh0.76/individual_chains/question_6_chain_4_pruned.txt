Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. And there are four options to choose from.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with potentials in two dimensions, especially with cylindrical symmetry (since r and θ are polar coordinates), it's useful to separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. But in this case, the potential doesn't have full rotational symmetry because of the cos²θ term. Oh right, because cos²θ can be expressed in terms of cos(2θ), which means the potential depends on the angle in a specific way—so the symmetry is less than full rotational.

But how does that affect the solution? I think that in cases where the potential has angular dependence, the separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation becomes a bit more involved. Alternatively, sometimes we can still separate into radial and angular parts, but the angular part might have a non-trivial solution.

Wait, another approach: maybe we can rewrite the potential in a way that makes it easier to handle. Let's see. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out (1/2)k r². So that becomes (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. But wait, 3 cos²θ can be written as 3/2 (1 + cos 2θ), right? Because cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes (1/2)k r² [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2].

Wait, let me compute that: 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/2)(1 + cos2θ). So when I add 1, it becomes 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So the potential becomes (1/2)k r
