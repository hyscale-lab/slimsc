Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the value of 'a'. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

We have a large number of identical systems—10,000 of them, each with a particle in the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is the x-axis direction. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, 'i' is the square root of -1, so that's the imaginary unit. 

The important thing here is when they measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So all the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3. 

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, especially when the particle is confined to a specific region. The wave function must be normalizable, which means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Also, the wave function should be zero outside the region where the particle exists because the probability of finding the particle there is zero.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex wave function. Oh, right, wave functions can be complex, but when we take the modulus squared (which is the probability density), the imaginary parts should cancel out correctly. 

But let's focus on the normalization condition. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. Because outside this range, the wave function is zero (since the particles aren't found there), the integral from -infinity to infinity is just the integral from 1 to 3.

So, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - (0.5)i.

The modulus squared is ψ*(x) ψ(x), which is [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i ].

Multiplying that out: (a^2)/(1 + x) + ( (0.5i)(a / sqrt(1 +x)) ) - (0.5i)(a / sqrt(1 +x)) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it as (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B².

So A is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5, since the second term is 0.5i. So |ψ|² = A² + B² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, no. Because the terms are (a/sqrt(1+x)) and 0.5i. So when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (a/sqrt(1+x)) you get a²/(1+x). Then, (a/sqrt(1+x))*(-0.5i) is the second term, and then (0.5i)*(a/sqrt(1+x)) is another term, and the last term is (0.5i)*(-0.5i) = -0.25i² = -0.25*(-1) = 0.25. 

But the cross terms (the second and third terms when you multiply out) would be (a/sqrt(1+x))*(-0.5i) + (0.5i)*(a/sqrt(1+x)) = (-0.5i a / sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i a / sqrt(1+x)) ) which equals zero. So the cross terms cancel each other out. So |ψ|^2 is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. So, integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me split this integral into two parts: integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx + integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

The first integral is a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3, it's [ln(4) - ln(2)] = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3, which is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² [ln(2)] + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the first integral is a² * ln(2), and the second is 0.5. So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 → 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.721.

Wait, wait, 0.5 divided by 0.693 is around 0.720.

So a is sqrt(0.720) ≈ 0.8485. Let me compute that. sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485. So approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Let me recheck:

The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

The modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2 → [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

The integral from x=1 to x=3 is ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

Which is a² ln(4/2) (because 1+3=4 and 1+1=2) → a² ln(2) plus 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Yes, ln(2) is about 0.6931, so 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.720.

So a is sqrt(0.720) ≈ 0.8485, which is ~0.85. So option B.


To determine the value of \(a\), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is confined between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx\)
2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx\)

For the first term, the integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln|1+x|\). Evaluating from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second term:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.720
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.720} \approx 0.8485 \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
