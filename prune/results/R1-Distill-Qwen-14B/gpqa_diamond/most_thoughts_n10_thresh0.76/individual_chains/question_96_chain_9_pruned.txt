Okay, so I have this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which is related to their area. Oh right, the black hole entropy formula! I think it's something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, the question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. Oh right, so I need to find the radius of the event horizon first, and then calculate the area from that.

The event horizon radius R is given by R = 2 G M / c^2. But wait, I don't have the mass M directly. Instead, I have the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh, right! The angular size θ relates the radius R and the distance d through the formula θ ≈ R / d, assuming θ is small, which it is here (1e-17 degrees).

So first, I can find R by R = θ * d. But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me think about the units. θ is in degrees, and d is in parsecs. I should convert θ to radians because the formula R = θ * d (in radians) gives R in the same units as d, which is parsecs. Oh, and then I can convert parsecs to meters to work with SI units.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Convert θ from degrees to radians.
2. Calculate R = θ (radians) * d (parsecs). Then convert R to meters.
3. Find the area A = 4 π R^2.
4. Plug A into the entropy formula to find S.

Wait, but maybe I can find a shortcut or use some known relations. Let me think about the entropy formula again. The entropy S is proportional to the area A, right? So S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Alternatively, I've heard that S is also given by (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) multiplied by (R^2 / (something)). Not sure, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Let me start with the angular size. θ is 1e-17 degrees. To convert to radians: 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ = 1e-17 * (π/1
