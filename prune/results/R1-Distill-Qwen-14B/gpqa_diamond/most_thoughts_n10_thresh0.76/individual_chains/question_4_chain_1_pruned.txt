Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a different universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles, like how you can't have a single pole by itself. That's probably because of the way the magnetic field lines work—they start at the north and end at the south, so they can't be isolated. 

Wait, Maxwell's equations! Right, there are four of them. Let me think about each one. The first equation is about the divergence of the electric field. Oh, right, Gauss's law for electricity. That says that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed. I don't think that would change because it's about electric fields and charge, not magnetism.

The second equation is about the curl of the electric field. Oh, Faraday's law of induction. It says that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field. So the curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. Hmm, not sure if this would change unless magnetism is behaving differently, but let's see.

The third equation is Gauss's law for magnetism. Oh, right, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. That's because in our universe, there are no isolated magnetic charges—so the field lines don't start or end anywhere. So if in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that would imply magnetic monopoles exist. So Gauss's law for magnetism would change. Instead of the divergence being zero, it would be some function of magnetic charge density. So that equation would definitely be different.

The fourth equation is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition. It's about the curl of the magnetic field being proportional to the current plus the displacement current. That equation deals with how magnetic fields are generated by currents and changing electric fields. I don't think this would change because it's more about how fields relate to currents and charges, not the existence of monopoles.

So the question is, which equations would look different if magnetic monopoles exist? Well, the third equation definitely changes because that's the one that states the divergence of B is zero. But wait, the question says which equations are different. Wait a second, I thought Maxwell's equations also have the part about the curl of B. Let me think again.

Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, what happens to Maxwell's equations? I remember that introducing monopoles would require modifying two of Maxwell's equations. Because in the standard equations, the divergence of B is zero, and the curl of E is related to the time derivative of B.

If magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. It would be something like rho_m (magnetic charge density) times a constant. That's one equation changed.

What about Faraday's law? In standard physics, the curl of E is -dB/dt. If there are magnetic currents, then perhaps there's an additional term. Wait, no—Faraday's law is about how changing B fields create E fields. But if magnetic monopoles exist, maybe the other equation would change too. Oh wait, the equation for the curl of B in Ampère's law involves the current density plus the displacement current. If there's a magnetic current, like a current made of monop
