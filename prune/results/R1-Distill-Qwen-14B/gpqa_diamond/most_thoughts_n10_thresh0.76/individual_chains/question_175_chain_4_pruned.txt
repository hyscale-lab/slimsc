Okay, so I have this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. They tell us that the maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also what form f has.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since the charge is spheroidal with z-axis symmetry, maybe it's like a dipole? Or perhaps a quadrupole? Wait, a dipole would have a certain radiation pattern, and higher multipoles have different ones.

Dipole radiation is a common case. If the charge distribution is oscillating in such a way that it behaves like a dipole, then the radiation would have specific characteristics. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is directional. The power radiated per unit solid angle (directivity) depends on the angle θ.

I think the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by something like (sinθ)^2. Because for a dipole, the radiation is stronger perpendicular to the axis, so the maximum is at θ=90 degrees. So the maximum power A would occur at θ=90, and at θ=0 (along the axis) there's minimum or zero power.

Wait, but if the maximum is at θ=90, then what's the power at θ=30 degrees? Let's see. The function f(θ) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So when θ is 30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5, so sin^2θ is 0.25. So the power at θ=30 is a quarter of the maximum. But wait, the maximum is at 90, which would be sin^2(90) = 1. So if the maximum is A, then the power at θ=30 is A * (0.25) = A/4.

Wait, but the question says the maximum power is A. So the power at θ=30 is 1/4 of A. So the fraction is 1/4.

But wait, the options have fractions like 1/2, 1/4, 3/4. So if it's 1/4, that's one of the options. Let's look at the options.

Looking at the options, options B and C have 1/4 as the first part. So the fraction of A is 1/4.

Now the second part is about the form of f, which is the function of λ and θ. So f is the power per unit solid angle, right? And in the radiation zone, the far field, the radiated power per unit solid angle (directivity) for a
