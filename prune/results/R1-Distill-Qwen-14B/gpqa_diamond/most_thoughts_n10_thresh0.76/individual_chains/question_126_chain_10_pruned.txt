Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, both involving different starting materials and reagents. After the reactions are completed, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, I'll break down each reaction.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone group in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one will be reduced. Let me imagine the structure. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3 of a six-carbon chain. The 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So, the structure is something like CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait: hexan-3-one would be CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh no, wait, the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the carbonyl is at C3, and C5 has the methoxy group.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me count: hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-... Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-but that's not right. Wait, maybe it's CH3CH2C(=O)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3-CH3. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it as:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So, 3 is the carbonyl. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's 6 carbons. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think: Hexan-3-one has a carbonyl group on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Hmm. Oh wait, hexan-3-one
