Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen signals are in the NMR of product 4. Let me go through each step carefully.

The question starts with acetic acid treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride while heated. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid has a -COOH group. When you treat it with bromine and pyridine, which is a base, I think it's undergoing some kind of substitution reaction. Oh wait, bromine with acetic acid under these conditions—maybe it's a bromination. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. Oh right, when acetic acid reacts with bromine in presence of a base like pyridine, which can absorb HBr, it probably forms the acetyl bromide. So product 1 is acetyl bromide, which is CH3COBr.

Next, product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. So, acetyl bromide reacting with ethanol. That sounds like an SN2 substitution. The bromide leaves, and the ethanol's oxygen attacks. So the product 2 would be ethyl acetate. Because when an acyl bromide reacts with an alcohol, you get an ester. So structure is CH3COOCH2CH3.

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide is a strong nucleophile. So, reacting with ethyl acetate. Wait, ethyl acetate is an ester. How does CN- react with esters? I think under certain conditions, like in acidic or basic conditions, esters can undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution. Sodium cyanide is a strong base, but maybe in this case, the conditions are such that the ester is being hydrolyzed or substituted. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the OCH2CH3 is replaced by CN. Wait, no—CN- is a nucleophile. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution on the ester. The ester oxygen is a good leaving group if activated. Wait, but esters typically undergo hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the alkoxide attacks. Wait, ethyl acetate plus NaCN—maybe it's a substitution at the oxygen. So the OCH2CH3 group is replaced by OCN-? Or perhaps it's a substitution where the CN replaces the ester group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another possibility is that the ester undergoes hydrolysis under basic conditions to form a carboxylate, but with NaCN, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack. Let me think again. Oh wait, no—ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3) reacting with NaCN in a nucleophilic substitution. The leaving group in the ester is the OR group. So the CN- would attack the carbonyl, but the carbonyl isn't very electrophilic without activation. Alternatively, maybe the ester group can undergo substitution if the OR group leaves as an alcohol. But that's not straightforward because OR- is a poor leaving group. Maybe the reaction is under acidic conditions, but the question says product 2 is treated with NaCN. Oh wait, product 2 is ethyl acetate, and then it's treated with NaCN. So maybe the reaction is a substitution where the ethoxide is replaced by cyanide.

Wait, wait. Another thought: perhaps the ester is undergoing a transesterification, but that would require another alcohol. Or maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. Wait, in the presence of a strong nucleophile like CN-, the ester could undergo substitution. The mechanism would be: CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, pushing the double bond to the oxygen, which then gets a negative charge. Then, the leaving group (the OR-) departs. So the product would be CH3CN with the ester group substituted. Wait no, that can't be right. Wait, if the ester is CH3COOEt, and CN- attacks, then the product would be CH3C(O)CN, with Et-O- as the leaving group. But wait, that doesn't quite make sense because the leaving group would be RO- which isn't a good
