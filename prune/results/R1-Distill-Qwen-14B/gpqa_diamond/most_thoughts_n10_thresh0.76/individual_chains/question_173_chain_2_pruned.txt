Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what I remember. The question says that an electron is moving at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE, of the electron. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of 10.

Hmm, right, I think this has to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. From what I remember, that principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) with the equation Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, sometimes I see it written as Δx ≈ ħ/(2Δp), but maybe I should just stick with the inequality for this.

So the first step is to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Once I have that, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy because energy is related to momentum via kinetic energy formulas, right?

Wait, but actually, for an electron, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum. So if I have an uncertainty in p, Δp, then the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to that. Let me think: since E = p²/(2m), taking the derivative, dE/dp = p/(m). So the uncertainty in E, ΔE ≈ (p/(m)) * Δp. But wait, since p is the average, maybe I should use the average p here. Alternatively, since we're dealing with uncertainties, perhaps ΔE is approximately (p * Δp)/m. But I'm not entirely sure about that, perhaps I should think more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle directly to get Δp, then using the momentum-energy relation. Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate Δp from Δx. The Heisenberg principle tells us that Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). I remember that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

The given Δx is 0.1 nm. Wait, a nanometer is 1e-
