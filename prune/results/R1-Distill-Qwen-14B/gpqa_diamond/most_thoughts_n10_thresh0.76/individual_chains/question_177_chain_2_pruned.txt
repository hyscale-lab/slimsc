Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They observed the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, and those wavelengths are the same. The radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. We need to find the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So the first thing I remember is that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, how does the mass come into play here? Oh right, maybe it's about the relation between mass and temperature for main-sequence stars. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the problem might be using the radial velocity to find the Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelength.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, because the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same, but adjusted for any Doppler shifts.

Wait, but the stars themselves might have different temperatures, but because of their velocities, their observed wavelengths are shifted. So the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual λ_max for each star (before shift) would be different. Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength changes due to the Doppler effect.

So let's think: the astronomers found the same observed λ_peak for both stars. Let me denote Star_1's actual emission peak as λ1, and Star_2's as λ2.

But due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelengths are λ1_observed = λ1 * sqrt( (1 + v1/c) / (1 - v1/c) ) ), assuming non-relativistic speeds. Similarly for Star_2, λ2_observed = λ2 * sqrt( (1
