Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. So, the question says that two planets are orbiting a star, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. 

Alright, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * ( (1 + e cos θ)/ (1 + 3e/2) )^(1/2) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that last part goes away. Also, both planets have the same albedo, so the albedo term cancels out when taking the ratio. 

So the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, the star's radius, and the planet's orbital distance a. The formula simplifies to T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ). 

Wait, but each planet's a (semi-major axis) isn't given directly. Oh, right! The question gives information about the Doppler shifts, which relates to the RV method. The Doppler shift (or the velocity) can help us find the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the question gives the shift in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. 

The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The maximum Doppler shift (v) is related to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K). The formula for K is K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ), but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. 

But wait, in the question, the shifts are given as up to 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for planets 1 and 2, respectively. The shift in wavelength is delta_lambda = lambda * (v/c), where v is the velocity of the star. So, delta_lambda is proportional to v. Therefore, K1 (for Planet1) is proportional to 0.03 Å, and K2 is proportional to 0.04 Å. 

So, K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4. 

But K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ), but since both planets are around the same star, M_star is the same, and perhaps we can assume that the inclination angles are similar or that sin i is similar or even 1 (edge-on orbits, which would maximize the RV signal). So, perhaps K is proportional to M_planet / (P^(1/3)) ). But wait, without knowing the period, how do I find a?

Alternatively, since both planets are detected via transit, which also requires edge-on orbit (so sin i ≈ 1), so we can say that sin i is 1 for both.

Wait, but transit method gives the planet's radius, which affects the depth of the transit. But RV gives the planet's mass. So, since the question gives the RV shifts, which relate to the planet's mass and orbital distance. 

Wait, maybe I should find the ratio of the periods or the semi-major axes to find a1 and a2. Because the equilibrium temperature depends on a. The formula for T is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

So, to find T1/T2, I need (a2/a1)^(1/2), because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). 

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, I need to find the ratio a2/a1.

How can I find a from the RV data? The RV semi-am
