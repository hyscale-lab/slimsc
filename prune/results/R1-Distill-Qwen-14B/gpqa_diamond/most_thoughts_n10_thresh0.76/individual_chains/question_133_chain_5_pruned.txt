Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can remember.

The problem says that there's a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), and the options are given.

Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So I think this has to do with the phosphate buffer system since we're mixing a weak acid and its conjugate base. Because H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, it can donate three protons. But in this case, I'm looking at H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, because those are the species in KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which is H2PO4^- as the anion. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which is HPO4^2- as the anion. So when you mix these, they form a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the relevant Ka is the second dissociation step because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2- and H+. The Ka2 is given as 6.2x10^-8. Oh wait, but wait, what's the exact dissociation?

H3PO4 is the first dissociation: H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-. So that's Ka1 = 7.5e-3.

Then the second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-. Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

Third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-. Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

But wait, the problem is asking about orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. So to get PO4^3-, it comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. Since Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), that's a very weak acid. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be really low because not much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

So the question is, what's the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution? Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let me think again.

Wait, the solution has both KH2PO4 (providing H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (provid
