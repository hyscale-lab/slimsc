Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which of the given compounds show optical isomerism. Let me take it step by step.

The question lists four compounds and asks which among them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, labeled A to D. I remember that optical isomerism is related to the presence of chiral centers, which are atoms with four different substituents. But wait, I should make sure I understand the concept correctly.

Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. This leads to enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These can cause the molecule to rotate plane-polarized light, hence the term optical isomers.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   Hmm, okay. So this is a biphenyl compound, which is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a carboxylate ester group (O-CO-OCH3) and a nitro group (NO2) at the 6 position. Wait, no, I think the numbers might be different. The formula is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

   Now, considering the structure, biphenyls can have different conformations, but unless there's a chiral center, they won't have optical isomerism. Wait, are there any chiral centers here? Let me think. Each ring is connected by a single bond, so rotation is possible. The substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across each other on the ring.

   Wait, but the molecule as a whole might have a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize it. The two substituents on each ring are in symmetrical positions. So, maybe the molecule is symmetrical because the substituents on each ring are mirror images of each other. So if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule might not have a chiral center. Because if it's symmetrical, any potential chiral center would be mirrored, leading to an achiral molecule.

   Alternatively, maybe the substituents create a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, the central single bond connecting the two benzene rings. Does that have any substituents? No, just two benzene rings. So the central bond doesn't have any substituents other than the rings themselves, which are identical. So each ring is symmetric, and the connecting bond doesn't introduce any chiral centers.

   Therefore, this compound probably doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
   Let's break this down. The structure is CH3CO-O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypro
