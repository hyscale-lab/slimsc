Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius. Hmm, I think melting points are important because they can help identify the substance. Also, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's think about the gas W. It has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. So the molecule must have the same number of p and n. Common gases... Let's see, maybe H2O? No, because O has 8 protons, but the molecule can't have equal p and n. Wait, what about CO2? No, same issue. Oh, maybe NH3? No, ammonia has 1 N and 3 H, but that's a molecule, not an atom. Wait, wait, gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Oh, perhaps it's a molecule where each atom has p = n? Or the molecule as a whole has equal p and n?

Wait, the problem says "same number of neutrons and protons". Oh wait, wait, gas W's molecule has same number of each. So the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons.

Hmm, possible gases. Let's think of diatomic gases. For example, O2: each O has 8 protons. So the molecule has 16 protons total, and each O has 8 neutrons (since O is usually O-16). So each O has 8 neutrons, so two O atoms would have 16 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons, so equal. That fits. So perhaps W is O2?

Alternatively, another gas, maybe CO2? No, that's a triatomic. Wait, but O2 is diatomic. That seems to fit.

Wait, so if W is O2, then during the reaction between X and Y, O2 is released. What reactions produce O2? Maybe a decomposition reaction, or perhaps a reaction involving peroxides or something else.

Next, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 3°C. So B is a solid at room temperature but melts just above 0°C. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water (0°C), but that's at 273 K. Wait, 277 K is 3°C. Hmm, perhaps B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl melts much higher. Wait, maybe something like paraffin wax? No, that's higher. Alternatively, maybe a metal that has a low melting point. Let's think of metals. Mercury is a liquid at room temp, but its melting point is about 234 K (-40°C). No, too low. Gallium melts around 30°C, which is 303 K, higher than 277 K. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is sodium bicarbonate? No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's something like a carbonate. Wait, perhaps B is something like a metal oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about what X and Y could be. Since X reacts violently with a liquid Y, and produces gas W (maybe O2), perhaps X is a metal, and Y is an acid. Let's say X is a metal reacting with an acid, producing H2 gas. But earlier I thought W was O2. Hmm, conflicting possibilities.

Wait, maybe I should think of the other clues. The product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. A keto acid is an organic acid with a ketone group. When it reacts with X, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of condensation reaction? Or maybe saponification? Or maybe it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. So the reaction adds one oxygen or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a neutralization reaction. For example, a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) reacting with a base. But the product would have more oxygens? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a strong oxidizing agent. Let's think about possible candidates. Common reagents in organic chemistry include things like KMnO4, K2Cr2O7, or maybe something else. Wait, but X is a substance that has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Maybe it's a halogen? For example, if X is Cl-35, but maybe if it's a compound like Cl2, but that's more about diatomic chlorine.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline what I know.

1. W is a gas with equal protons and neutrons. So, if it's O2, that fits.
2. X is a substance that when reacted with Y, a liquid, gives O2 and precipitate G.
3. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (~3°C).
4. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and is known for a heavier isotope. So, perhaps X is something like H2O2? Because H2O2 is used in organic reactions, and its O is the heavier isotope, like O-18?

Wait, H2O2 reacts with what? Maybe with a metal or acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where H2O2 acts as an oxidizing agent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is a metal. X is a liquid? Or X is a solid that reacts with a liquid Y. Let's see, H2O2 when mixed with a metal like zinc might produce hydrogen gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is Na2O2, which is a strong oxidizing agent. Sodium peroxide reacts with water (Y) to produce O2 gas and sodium hydroxide as a precipitate. Let me check that reaction.

The reaction of Na2O2 with water: 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. Yes, that's correct. So in this case, W is O2, which fits the condition of equal protons and neutrons (each O atom has 8 p and 8 n, so O2 has 16 p and 16 n). So that fits.

So, if X is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), then Y could be water.

The precipitate G would be NaOH, which is a strong base. But NaOH is soluble in water, so maybe it's precipitating as something else? Wait, no, sodium hydroxide is soluble. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the reaction wrong.

Wait, another possibility: X is another peroxide. Wait, what if X is hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, and Y is something else, like an acid or a metal? Let's think. H2O2 reacting with a metal might produce H2 gas. But earlier, I thought W was O2, but if W is H2, then H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since H is 1
