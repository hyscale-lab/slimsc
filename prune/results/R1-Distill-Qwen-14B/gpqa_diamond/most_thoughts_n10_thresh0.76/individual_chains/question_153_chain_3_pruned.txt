Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Let's start with the first part: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl acetoacetate equivalent, right? And the other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor.

So, in a Michael addition, the nucleophile (the enolate in this case) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group replacing one of the CH2 groups. Wait, no, wait. The formula is actually CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but here the substituent is at the 3 position? Hmm, maybe I should visualize the structure. 

Wait, the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but the p-tolyl group is on the alpha carbon. Oh wait, no. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the structure is like CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 2.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. The acceptor is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So the structure is CH2=CH
