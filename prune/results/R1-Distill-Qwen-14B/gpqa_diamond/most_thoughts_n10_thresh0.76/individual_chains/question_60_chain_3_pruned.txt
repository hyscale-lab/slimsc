Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they made a super fast spaceship that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is 150 solar years, which is way longer than humans. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes for them to reach Earth from their point of view.

Wait, right, because in relativity, time experienced by the traveler is different from the time experienced by someone on Earth. Oh, right, that's time dilation. So the astronaut's own clock will measure less time than what an Earth observer would see. But wait, the question is asking about the astronaut's perspective, so I need to calculate the proper time, which is the time experienced by the traveler.

First, I think I need to find out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the actual distance, but perhaps it's not necessary because the question is about the astronaut's lifetime. Let me thinkâ€”oh, wait, the problem probably assumes that the distance is such that without relativistic effects, the trip would take so long that the astronaut would die. But because of the high speed, their experienced time is shorter.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down. The speed is 0.99999987c. That's extremely close to the speed
