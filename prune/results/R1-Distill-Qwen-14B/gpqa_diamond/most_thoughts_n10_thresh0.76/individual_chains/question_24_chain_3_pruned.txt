Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves mixtures X and Y, and a substance Z. The key points are:

1. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, I remember that bromine water is decolorized by alkenes (alkenes cause it to decolorize because they undergo addition reactions with bromine). So, X has two liquids, both of which have alkenes in them.

2. When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. This reaction is a disproportionation. Disproportionation is when one element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, the initial substance is probably in an intermediate oxidation state and breaks down into two substances with different oxidation states.

3. Y doesn't decolorize bromine water anymore. That suggests that Y doesn't have alkenes anymore because alkenes would cause bromine to decolorize. So, maybe the alkenes were hydrogenated or otherwise modified.

4. When X and Y undergo hydrogenation with platinum under severe conditions, they both produce only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Let me calculate that. The mass fraction is mass of H divided by the molar mass. So, H is 14.28% of the molecule.

Wait, the mass fraction of H is (mass of H)/(molar mass of Z) = 0.1428. So, let's compute the molecular formula.

Assuming Z is a hydrocarbon, so CnHm.

The molar mass of Z is (12n + m). The mass of H is m * 1 g/mol. So, (m)/(12n + m) = 0.1428.

Let me rearrange that:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)
m = 1.7136 n + 0.1428 m
m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136 n
0.8572 m ≈ 1.7136 n
Divide both sides by 0.8572:
m ≈ (1.7136 / 0.8572) * n
Calculating that, 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2. So m ≈ 2n.

So the formula is roughly CnH2n. That sounds like an alkene or an alkyne, but wait, but Z is formed by hydrogenation. Oh, wait, hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds. So if Z is a product of hydrogenation, it must be a single bond compound. Wait, but if Z is a hydrocarbon with CnH2n, that would be an alkene. But that can't be, because if you hydrogenate an alkene, you get an alkane. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait no, the question states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and that it doesn't react further with hydrogen. So, Z must be an alkane because alkanes don't react with hydrogen under normal conditions. So, if Z is an alkane, its formula is CnH2n+2.

Wait, but the mass fraction of H is 14.28%. Let me try that again.

If Z is CnH2n+2, the molar mass is 12n + (2n + 2) =14n +2.

Mass of H is 2n+2 grams per mole, so the fraction is (2n+2)/(14n +2) =0.1428.

Let me set up that equation:

(2n + 2)/(14n + 2) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by (14n + 2):

2n + 2 = 0.1428*(14n + 2)

Let me compute the right side:

0.1428 *14n = 2n (since 14 * 0.1428 ≈ 2)
0.1428 * 2 = 0.2856

So right side is approx 2n + 0.2856.

So equation:

2n + 2 = 2n + 0.2856

Subtract 2n from both sides: 2 = 0.2856. Wait, that can't be right. So this approach must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me compute 14.28% as 1/7 approximately. Because 1
