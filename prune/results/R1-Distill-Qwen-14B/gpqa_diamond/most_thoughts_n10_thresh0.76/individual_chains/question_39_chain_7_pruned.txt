Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think this through.

The question is about a particle in a system. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So, I guess the wave function must be zero outside this region because that's where the particles aren't found.

Wait, right! In quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a region is related to the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So, the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3 because the particles aren't found there. But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) ) - 0.5i. So, when x is less than 1 or greater than 3, the wave function must be zero. Hmm, but let me think about that.

Wait, actually, the wave function given is just a part of the entire space. So perhaps this wave function is valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because the wave function must be zero outside those regions where the particles aren't found.

So, the wave function Ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

Now, for a valid wave function, it must satisfy the normalization condition. The integral of |Ψ|^2 dx over all space must equal 1. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1.

So, let's write that out. The integral from x=1 to x=3 of |Ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

What's |Ψ(x)|²? Since Ψ is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i, the absolute square is [ (a / sqrt(1 +x)) )^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

Wait, because when you have a complex number like A + iB, the absolute square is A² + B². So, in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. So, A squared is (
