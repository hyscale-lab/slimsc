Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra.

Okay, starting with what I know. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring—so two substituents on the benzene. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch in IR, which typically appears around 1740 cm^-1. So that's a key point—ester group present.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let me break them down. Two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets), and two -CH3 signals. Also, no -CH2 signals. Hmm, so probably no methylene groups (CH2) in the structure.

So, let me think about the substituents on the benzene. Since it's a di-substituted ring, the substituents could be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But given the NMR, the splitting patterns may give some clues.

The NMR shows two aromatic H signals. For a para-substituted benzene, you usually get two sets of aromatic Hs, each as a doublet. Wait, but wait—if it's para, each substituent is opposite each other, leading to two distinct sets of aromatic protons, each with two H's. But wait, in our case, the two substituents could be different or the same. If they're different, the aromatic Hs could split into more signals.

Wait, but the NMR has two signals for aromatic H. So maybe the substituents are such that the aromatic ring symmetry leads to only two sets. Like, if the substituents are in para positions and are the same, then the aromatic Hs would be equivalent. But in this case, the substituents are different because the NMR shows two signals. Or perhaps one substituent is in a position that creates symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are para and create two sets of equivalent Hs. Hmm, not entirely sure yet.

Next, the vinyl H signals. The NMR shows two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl Hs are typically in an Ester group, maybe part of a substituent like an acetyl group or an ester substituent.

Ester groups have the structure R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, more accurately, an ester is RCOOR'. So if the substituent is an ester, perhaps it's like an aryl ester or maybe an ester attached via an oxygen. Wait, no, esters are usually R-O-CO-R, like maybe something like OCOOR attached to the ring.

But wait, let's think of substituents. Suppose one substituent is an ester group, like OCOOR. Then, the other substituent is something else. Alternatively, both substituents could be ester groups, but that seems less likely because of the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is an alkyl group, but then I'm not sure. Let's think about the possible structure.

Wait, the NMR has two -CH3 signals. So, maybe two different methyl groups. Like, perhaps an ester group with a methyl (like OCOOCH3 is a methyl ester, but that would be one CH3). Alternatively, maybe other groups.

Wait, considering the IR shows an ester, so at least one ester group is present. So, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR), and the other is a vinyl group? Or maybe another substituent.

Wait, the vinyl Hs are showing up as two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests coupling with adjacent Hs. For a vinyl group, like CH2=CH, but in the NMR, the coupling depends on the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a substituent like a
