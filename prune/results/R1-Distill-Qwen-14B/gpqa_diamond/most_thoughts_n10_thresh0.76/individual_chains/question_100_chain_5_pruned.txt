Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. I remember that the molecular formula C3H6 could correspond to a couple of alkenes—like propene (which is CH2=CHCH3) or maybe cyclopropane, but cyclopropane is a ring structure. Wait, but let me think—carbon tetrachloride is mentioned as the solvent for bromination. So maybe it's an addition reaction. Oh wait, C3H6 is probably propene since it's an alkene and would undergo bromination in CCl4 via an addition reaction. Alternatively, it could be another compound, but propene is a common one.

So, Compound A is C3H6, likely propene. When it undergoes bromination in CCl4, that's a typical dibromination for alkenes. So propene would react with bromine water (or in this case, CCl4 as a solvent perhaps? Wait no, bromination in CCl4 is usually a non-polar solvent, so maybe it's bromine in CCl4, which is a solution. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with Br2 in CCl4, which would add across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B would be CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait, no—no, wait. Propene is CH2=
