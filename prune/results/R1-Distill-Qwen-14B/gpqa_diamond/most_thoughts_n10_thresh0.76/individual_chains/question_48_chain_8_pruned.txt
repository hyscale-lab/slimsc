Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through each reaction and what's happening to the molecule.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So, its structure is like a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a carbonyl group (C=O).

The first reaction is cyclohexanone treated with bromine, forming product 1. Hmm, bromine usually adds to carbonyl groups. Oh wait, but wait. Bromine (Br2) in a certain solvent could lead to different reactions. Oh right, when ketones react with bromine, they undergo addition. The mechanism is probably an enolate formation or maybe an electrophilic addition.

Wait, wait. I think when ketones react with Br2, it's a bromohydrin formation. Or maybe it's a diaddition if it's in a different condition. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone. So, adding Br2 would add across the carbonyl. Wait, that's addition of bromine to the carbonyl, but I'm a bit confused about the exact product.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a halohydrin formation. No, that's when you have something like HX and X2. Wait no, in the presence of water, perhaps. But the question doesn't mention any other reagents, just Br
