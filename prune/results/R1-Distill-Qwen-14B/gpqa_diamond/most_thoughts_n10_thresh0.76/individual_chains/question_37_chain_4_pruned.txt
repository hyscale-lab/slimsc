Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of 13C NMR signals for the final product E. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'll start by trying to understand each reaction in the series.

The starting material is propionaldehyde. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO, right? So that's a three-carbon chain with an aldehyde group on the end.

The first reaction is with EDT and BF3. Wait, what's EDT? Oh, right, EDT is ethyl diisopropyl tin. And BF3 is a Lewis acid catalyst. I remember that when aldehydes react with something like that, it's a Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde with an ylide. So in this case, the ylide is generated from EDT and BF3. So the aldehyde (A) will react to form an alkene. So product A would be the alkene formed from propionaldehyde. Since propionaldehyde has an aldehyde group, when the Wittig reaction happens, the O of the aldehyde becomes a double bond. So propionaldehyde (CH2CH2CHO) would become CH2CH2CH2— wait, no, wait. The general Wittig reaction converts RCHO into RCH2CH2– no, wait. Wait, the ylide structure is something like (CH2CH2CH2+), so when it reacts with aldehyde, it would form CH2=CHCH2... Wait, wait. Let me think. The starting aldehyde is propanal: CH3CH2CHO. The Wittig would form an alkene. The reaction is RCHO + (ylide) → RCH=CH2 + oxide. So the aldehyde group (CHO) becomes a CH2 group, and the ylide's R groups (from EDT) adds. Wait, but wait, what's the structure of the ylide here? Since the ylide is from EDT, which is triethyltin. Wait, no, EDT is ethyl diisopropyl tin, so the ylide would have a structure like [CH2CH2CH2]+... Wait, no, maybe I should think of the ylide as (CH2CH2CH2) group where the central carbon is connected to two isopropyl groups and an ethyl group. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is (CH2CH
