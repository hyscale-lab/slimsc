Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's see what it says. 

Alright, the setup: there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters away from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, minimum energy. So I think this is about calculating the electric potential energy of the system in its configuration. Because electric potential energy is a state function, so the minimum would be the configuration where the charges are placed in the most stable way, but in this case, the charges are fixed except for the 13th. Or wait, no: all 12 are at 2m from P, so maybe the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are arranged in a sphere around it? Or maybe all 12 are at the same distance from P, so they form a spherical shell or something.

Wait, the problem states that 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of these 12 is 2 meters away from point P. And the 13th is fixed at P. So, the arrangement is that all 12 are at the same distance from the central charge.

So the system consists of two parts: the potential energy between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait. When calculating the electric potential energy of a system of charges, you have to consider all pairs. So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But in this case, the system comprises a central charge and 12 surrounding charges, and the 12 surrounding charges are all at the same distance from the center.

So, the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential between the central charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energy between each pair of the
