Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically used in conjugate additions or for opening epoxides. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about a disubstituted epoxide reacting with Me2CuLi. Wait, the setup says when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates, the alkyl group from the reagent goes to the less hindered carbon. Oh right, and in the case of disubstituted epoxides, there's inversion of configuration when the nucleophile adds.

The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane... that's a norbornane structure. Norbornane has two rings, a five-membered and a three-membered bridge. The numbering is such that the bridgehead carbons are 1 and 4, I think. So, the 7-oxa means there's an oxygen in place of one bridgehead, making it an epoxide. Wait, in norbornene, the epoxide would be at the bridgehead, so maybe it's a bicyclic epoxide.

So, the molecule has methyl groups at positions 1,3,4, and the epoxide oxygen is at position 6 (since it's 7-oxa, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the numbering here). Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1], but this is [4.1.0], which is a different structure. Maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of it as a bicyclo system with seven atoms in total. The substituents are 1,3,4-trimethyl, and the oxygen is at position 7. Wait, maybe the structure is more like a five-membered ring with an oxygen? I'm a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed.

So when the epoxide reacts with Me2CuLi, the organocuprate will attack the less
