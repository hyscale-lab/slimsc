Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem about nuclear decay. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the original decay converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A into two B, and emits two E and two V particles. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It says the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with an endpoint Q.

Now, the variant changes things. Instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. I need to compare the energy spectrum of E particles in this new case to the original.

Wait, I remember something about decay processes and energy spectra. In beta decay, for example, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the decay involves multiple particles, and the energy is shared. But if the decay emits fewer particles, the spectrum might change.

In the original decay, two E and two V are emitted. So perhaps the energy of E depends on their sharing the available energy. But in the variant, we have two E and one M, which is massless. So M must carry away some energy and momentum.

Wait, but M is massless. That suggests it's like a photon, maybe. So in the original case, the decay emits two E and two V. Let's think about energy and momentum conservation.

In the original, if the E and V are lighter particles, the energy released is Q. The E particles' energy spectrum is continuous because they can share the energy in various ways. The maximum energy they can have (the endpoint) is when all the available energy goes into E. But wait, in the original case, since there are two E and two V, perhaps the maximum energy for each E would be lower than if there were only two E and one M.

Wait, but in the original decay, the endpoint Q is the maximum energy an E can have. So maybe each E can't have more than Q. But when there are more particles emitted, the maximum E for each might be lower.

Wait, but in the variant, they emit M instead of two V. So since M is massless, and in the original case, the two V are probably not massless. Wait, the problem says E and V are much lighter, but M is exotic and
