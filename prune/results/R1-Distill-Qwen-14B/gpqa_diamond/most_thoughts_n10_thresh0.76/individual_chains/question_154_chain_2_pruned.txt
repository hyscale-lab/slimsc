Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which structure the given spectral data corresponds to. Let me see what I can do. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down step by step.

The problem says a chemist found an unnamed white solid and has some spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to match the data to one of them. Let's look at each piece of data one by one.

First, the Mass Spec: The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and there's another peak at 158 (32%). Hmm. The molecular ion is the highest m/z for the molecular formula. So the molecular weight is 156. The other peak is two units higher, which might indicate a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has isotopes at about 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion would have a peak at M and M+2, depending on how many Cls are present. Since the M is 156, and the next peak is 158 (which is +2), maybe there's one Cl in the molecule. Let's see: 156 would be the more abundant isotope (35Cl), and 158 would be 37Cl, but wait, no, wait: 35 is more abundant, so for a molecule with one Cl, the M would be 35Cl at 156 (assuming the rest of the formula adds up to 155?), and the M+2 would be 37Cl at 158, which is less abundant. So the abundance of 32% is a bit confusing because 37Cl is about 25% naturally. Maybe there are two Cls? Wait, but then the M would be higher, but 156 is the molecular ion, so perhaps only one Cl. Let me think. So the molecular weight is 156. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

Let me calculate their molecular weights.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Chlorine adds 35.5. So molecular weight is 12*7 + 1*6 + 16*2 +35.5 = 84 +6 +32 +35.5 = 157.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is 156. Hmm, maybe it's 157? Or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2: 7 carbons, 6 H, 2 O. So 7*12=84, 6*1=6, 2*16=32. Total 84+6=90+32=122. Add Cl (35.5) → 122 +35.5=157.5, which would round to 158. But the molecular ion here is 156. Hmm, so maybe B isn't the right one.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula as B, just the Cl is in a different position. Same molecular weight, 157.5, so same issue.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl and OH. Let's see: Benzaldehyde is C7H6O (wait, no, benzaldehyde is C7H6O: C6H5CHO, which is C7H6O. So adding Cl and OH would change the formula. Wait, the structure is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2? Let me count. The benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding OH would add an O and subtract an H (since replacing a H on the ring with OH). Adding Cl would add Cl and subtract H. So the formula becomes C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5 (Cl)=35.5, 2*16=32. 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. Close enough to 156. So the molecular ion would be around 156, which matches the given data. So that's a possibility.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be ClCO-O-C6H5? Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So phenyl chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-C6H5. The formula is C8H7ClO2. Wait, let me see: The chloroformate group is Cl, COO-. So phenyl is C6H5, so O-C6H5, then Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2? Wait, wait. Let me count:

Phenyl group is C6H5. Then the chloroformate is O=C(O-)Cl. Hmm, wait no. The structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the molecular formula is C7 H5 Cl O2. Molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5 for Cl, 2*16=32. Total 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. So molecular weight about 156, matching the molecular ion. So option C also has a molecular weight of 156.

Wait, so options A and C have molecular weights around 156. So the molecular ion makes sense for both.

Now, looking at the Mass Spec, the molecular ion is 156, and there's a peak at 158, which is 156 +2. So what could cause that? If the molecular formula includes Cl, then the molecular ion would have isotopic peaks. For one Cl, the peak at M is 156 (35Cl), and M+2 is 158 (37Cl), but the abundance would be 3:1 (since 35Cl is about 75% and 37Cl is about 24%, but the exact ratio depends on the number of Cl atoms and their natural abundance). Wait, the problem states the molecular ion is at 100% (probably the base peak), and the 158 is at 32%. Hmm.

Wait, for a molecule with one Cl atom, the M would be 35Cl (75% natural abundance) and M+2 would be 37Cl (25%). So the ratio of M+2 to M would be roughly 25:75=1:3. So the M+2 should be about 33% of the M peak, right? Because (25%)/(75%) = 1/3 ≈ 33%. The data shows M at 100% and M+2 at 32%, which is very close to this 1:3 ratio. So that suggests one Cl atom. So both options A and C have one Cl, so their molecular ion fits. So that doesn't help us choose between A and C.

Wait, but looking at option C, phenyl chloroformate: structure is O=C(OCl)-O-C6H5? No, wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is 156.5, which is about 157. Wait, but the molecular ion is 156. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let me recount: C is 12, so 7 C = 84. H is 5 → 5. Cl is 35.5. O is 2 → 32. So total is 84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So the molecular ion should be at 157? Or is it at 156? Hmm, perhaps the molecular ion is at the integer 156, but the actual molecular weight is 156.5. So in mass spec, the exact mass would be about 156.5, but the m/z is given as 156. So perhaps it's a mistake, or maybe it's the nominal mass. So maybe both are possible.

But let's think about the IR. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is probably O-H stretch. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. The 1720 region is indicative of carbonyl groups. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, but if it's an ester or an aldehyde, maybe higher. Wait, for a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is broad, which fits with the broad peak. The 1720 peak could be an ester or maybe a carbonyl group in another structure.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde has a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. The aldehyde carbonyl is usually around 1720 cm^-1, which fits the IR data. The O-H from the hydroxy group (2-hydroxy) would give a broad peak around 3200-3500, which fits the IR data.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: has a carboxylic acid group. The O-H would be broad, and the carbonyl would be around 1700, perhaps a bit lower than 1720. So the 1720 peak might be a bit higher than expected for a carboxylic acid. But maybe it's possible.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: has a carbonyl group in the chloroformate ester. The ester carbonyl is usually around 1740-1720 cm^-1. So 1720 is right in the middle. Also, this compound is an ester, so no O-H stretch except maybe from any acidic protons, but I don't think so. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is an acyl chloride derivative? No, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So the structure has an ester group (O-CO-O). Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R, so the carbonyl is part of an ester. So IR peak at 1720 fits. However, would there be any O-H in phenyl chloroformate? Probably not, unless it's a different structure. So the broad peak in the IR might
