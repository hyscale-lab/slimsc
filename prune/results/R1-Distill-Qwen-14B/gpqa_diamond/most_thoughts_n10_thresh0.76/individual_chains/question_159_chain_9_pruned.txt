Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's comoving distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

So the question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I remember that when objects are very far away, their light gets redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. So, if something emits light at a certain wavelength, we might observe it at a longer wavelength if it's moving away or if the universe has expanded since the light was emitted.

Wait, quasars are very bright and active galactic nuclei. Their emission lines can be broad and sometimes have specific features. But in this case, the peak is at 790 nm. I think that's in the near-infrared range. But why does the flux drop below that? Oh, maybe because the emission line is only strong at that peak, and there's not much else. Or perhaps it's about dust extinction, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the question is about determining the comoving distance of the quasar. Comoving distance is a way to measure distance in an expanding universe, right? It combines the effects of the expansion over time. The formula I remember is something like comoving distance D_C = (1 + z) times the proper distance at the time of emission.

But wait, the comoving distance when a=1 is a bit confusing. I think a=1 corresponds to the present time, so
