Okay, so I have this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I should think through this carefully.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, right? So the photospheres are in LTE, which probably means I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The formula is n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. In this problem, I think the statistical weights might be the same for both stars because we're comparing iron atoms in the same transition. Oh wait, the problem states it's a specific energy level, so maybe g is the same for both cases. Or does it not matter, because the ratio would take care of that?

The excitation here is given as twice as high for star_1. So if I denote the populations as n1 and n2 for star_1 and star_2 respectively, then n1/n2 = 2. Oh wait, but the question says the atoms are twice as excited, which I think refers to the population ratio. So n1/n2 = 2.

But wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So let's call delta E = 1.38e-23 J.

Let me write the Boltzmann equation for each star. For star 1: n1 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - delta E/(k*T1) ). Similarly for star 2: n2 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - delta E/(k*T2) ). 

Since we're taking the ratio n1/n2, the g terms (assuming same for both) would cancel out. So the ratio is n1/n2 = exp( [ - delta E/(k T1) + delta E/(k T2) ] ), because when you take n1/n2, it's exp( (delta E/(k T2) - delta E/(k T1) ) )? Wait, let me think.

Wait, the exponent in n1 is
