Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid typically has a broad O-H stretch and a strong carbonyl around 1700. That makes sense because carboxylic acids have both.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are several signals, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, the compound doesn't have any double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, which would show up as a vinyl signal. That probably rules out any alkenes or aromatic rings, which the structures given don't seem to have anyway.

Now, the NMR part. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about what kind of splitting that would cause.

In NMR, splitting occurs due to neighboring hydrogens. Each neighboring set of equivalent Hs will split the signal into a multiplet. Let's think about each of the options and see which structure would lead to such splitting patterns.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, structure-wise, this is something like CH2CH2C(C2H5)2CH2COOH. Wait, no, more precisely, the molecule is CH3-C-(C2H5)(H) connected to another CH connected to C2H5 and then a CH2COOH. Hmm. Let me draw it:

The central part is a CH attached to two C2H5 groups. Wait, no, each CH is connected to a (C2H5) and a H. So the structure is CH(CH2CH2CH3)2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Let me parse the formula correctly.

Wait, the formula for option A is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central carbons are two CH groups each attached to a C2H5 (ethyl) group and a H. So the structure around those CHs would have each CH connected to two ethyl groups and a hydrogen. So each CH has two adjacent ethyl groups.

So for the NMR, the hydrogens on those central CHs would be next to each other. Because each CH is next to another CH. So each CH group's H would be adjacent to the Hs on the neighboring CH. So the splitting would be between the two CHs.

Wait, each CH has a hydrogen adjacent to the other CH's hydrogen. So each H is split
