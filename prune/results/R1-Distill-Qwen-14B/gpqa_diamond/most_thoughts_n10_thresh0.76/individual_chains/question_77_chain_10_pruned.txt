Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and some other reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the major products A and B based on the given reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene reacts with BuLi followed by H+. I remember BuLi is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Wait, but in the context of the Cope rearrangement? Oh wait, no, maybe it's a different reaction here. Wait, wait, the question says the Cope rearrangement is when a 1,5-diene rearranges. Oh, but the first reaction here uses BuLi and H+, not heat or light. So maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a substituted benzene with an ether group. The structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl benzene. So the structure would be benzene with a CH2-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2 group attached? Or wait, maybe the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl attached to benzene. So it's benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me draw it. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl.

Wait, butyl groups can be a bit confusing. The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's actually isoprene maybe? Wait, no. The structure is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl: so the butenyl has four carbons, with a double bond starting at position 2. So the structure is CH2-CH(C(CH3))=CH2. Hmm, maybe I should number it. So the butenyl is CH2-CH2-CH(C(CH3))-CH2? Wait, no, wait but the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the chain is 4 carbons long, with a double bond between
