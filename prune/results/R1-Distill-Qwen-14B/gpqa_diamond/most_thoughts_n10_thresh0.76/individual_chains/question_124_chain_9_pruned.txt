Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, let's read the question again.

The setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that move at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls? The options are A) 54, B) 68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, right, Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time dilates and length contracts in special relativity. So for a particle moving at a certain speed, gamma tells us how much slower their clock runs from our perspective. But how does that relate to the particles reaching the detector walls?

I remember that for a particle moving at a high speed, the distance it travels in our frame is contracted. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the detector is of a fixed radius. So the particles are moving at speed v, and their lifetime in their rest frame is tau. Then, in our frame, their lifetime is gamma * tau. Because of time dilation.

The particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel before decaying is v multiplied by gamma tau. Because in our frame, their lifetime is longer, so they can travel further.

Wait, but the problem says that the particles are "fast-decaying". So they decay quickly, so the distance they travel before decaying determines whether they reach the detector walls.

So the detector's radius is 30 meters. So if their lifetime allows them to travel 30 meters, they reach the walls.

Let me think about the original situation. When gamma is 20, how much of the particles reach the walls?

The problem states that on average, one third reach the walls. So the number reaching the walls is the fraction that can travel 30 meters before decaying.

So the average distance they travel is 30 meters when gamma is 20 for one third of them. Wait, no. Because the problem says that one third reach the walls. So in the case of gamma=20, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is 1/3.

Wait, maybe I should model this with the proper time. Each particle has a proper lifetime tau. The time it lives in our lab frame is gamma * tau. The distance it travels is v multiplied
