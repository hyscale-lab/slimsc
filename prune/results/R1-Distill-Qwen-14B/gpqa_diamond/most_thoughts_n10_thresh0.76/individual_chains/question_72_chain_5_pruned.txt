Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. After that, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to make product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C to give product 4. The question is how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A) 8, B) 4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. I need to track all these reactions and figure out the structure of product 4. Let me try to break this down.

First, let me think about the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure, right? So the molecule has a bridge structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So that's like an ether group, O connected to tert-butyl.

Next reaction: combining with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, especially in a substitution reaction. The other compound has two dibromomethyl groups attached to a cyclohexadiene ring. So each of these is probably a good leaving group situation.

Wait, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two substituents at positions 5 and 6, each being a dibromomethyl group. So each is CH2Br2, but wait, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2? No, wait, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2? Wait, no, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2. Wait, but wait, that's impossible because a CH2 can't have two Br atoms—oh wait, no, maybe it's CH2Br2 as a substituent. Maybe each group is -CH2Br attached twice? No, that can't be. Wait, the formula says 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl). Oh, right, so each position 5 and 6 has a -CH2Br group. So each substituent is CH2Br. Wait, no, wait, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2? No, that's impossible because a single carbon can't have two bromines unless it's a geminal dihalide. So each substituent is -CH2Br. Wait, but the molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so each position 5 and 6 has a CH2Br group? So each substituent is a methyl
