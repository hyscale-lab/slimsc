Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues given are from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. I remember that esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), which typically absorbs around 1730-1760 cm⁻¹. So, the compound has an ester functional group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H: So, the aromatic ring has two sets of protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents are probably in positions that cause two different types of aromatic protons. For example, maybe one substituent is para to another, or perhaps they are meta. But wait, di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns. Let's think. If the substituents are para, then each proton set would be equivalent, but wait, no, wait. If it's di-substituted, say, with two substituents in para positions, the aromatic protons would be in two sets. Because each substituent is in para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Like, for example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 3 (meta) or 1 and 4 (para). Wait, no, for a di-substituted benzene, the substitution can be para (two substituents opposite each other) or ortho (adjacent) or meta (with one substituent between them). But in the case of di-substitution, the number of aromatic proton signals would depend on the substitution pattern.

Wait, for a para substituted benzene, if both substituents are the same and in para positions, the molecule would have two equivalent protons on either side. Wait, no, in para substitution, the ring would actually have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 3, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh wait, no.
