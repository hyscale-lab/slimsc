Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. Spin-half particles... I remember those are like electrons or something, with spin up or down. 

The state given is a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh right, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. So σz is the Pauli z-matrix, right? Its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, and the eigenvalues are +1 and -1, respectively.

The operator we're supposed to find the expectation value for is 10σz +5σx. So I think the expectation value is the sum of each term's expectation multiplied by their coefficients. Like, <10σz +5σx> = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, I need to find the expectation values of σz and σx for the given state. Let's start with σz because that's easier since the state is already in σz eigenstates.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me write that as a vector. For spin-½ particles, |↑⟩ is [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So ψ would be [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Wait, but we need to make sure it's normalized. Let's check: 0.5^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. Yep, it's normalized.

Now, for σz, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ minus the probability of being in |↓⟩. Because σz |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So the expectation is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expectation value is the sum of probabilities times their respective eigenvalues. Because for σz, if the state is a linear combination, the expectation is |a|^2 * (eigenvalue for |↑⟩) + |b|^2 * (eigenvalue for |↓⟩).

So |a| is 0.5, so |a|^2 is 0.25, and |b| is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is 3/4. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (3/4)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So that's the σz part. Then, for the operator 10σz, the expectation is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto σx. σx is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So its expectation value is a bit trickier. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Wait, alternatively, I remember that for σx, which represents the spin in the x-direction, the expectation value can also be found using the coefficients of the state. But since the state is not an eigenstate of σx, I can't just take the probabilities. So I need to compute it properly.

Let me write the state ψ as a vector. As I said before, ψ = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Let's compute σx ψ.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you apply it to ψ, you get [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. So σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, the expectation value ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is ψ† σx ψ. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], right? Because it's the conjugate transpose, but since all coefficients are real, it's just the transpose.

So ψ† σx ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, σx is applied to ψ, so σx |ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then, ψ† (which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]) multiplied by σx |ψ⟩.

So the product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me be precise. 

The expectation is ψ† σx ψ. So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So compute the dot product: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5.

So that's (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 0.5 * sqrt(3).

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4.

Second term: sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = (sqrt(3))/4.

So sum is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to use the formula involving the amplitude. I remember that for a spin-½ state in the x direction, the expectation value can be found using the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the state as being in some direction, but maybe it's easier to stick with the calculation I did.

So, the expectation value for σx is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So then, the operator 5σx will have an expectation of 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

Wait, wait. Let me add up the two parts. The total expectation value for the operator 10 σz +5 σx is 10 ⟨σz⟩ +5 ⟨σx⟩.

We have ⟨σz⟩ as -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) = -5.

⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

So the sum is -5 +4.3301 = -0.6699, approximately.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the ⟨σx⟩ calculation. Because when I compute σx acting on ψ, I get [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], and then the inner product with ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] · [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Wait, that's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) = 0.5*0.8660 + 0.8660 *0.5 = 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.866, so yes, that's correct.

So the total expectation is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33 = -0.67. So approximately -0.67.

But wait, the options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

Hmm, -0.67 is close to option C) -0.7.

Wait, but let me think again. Because I might have done a mistake in calculating ⟨σx⟩.

Another approach: The expectation value of σx can also be found using the formula:

⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 (⟨↓|σx|↑⟩) + |b|^2 (⟨↑|σx|↓⟩) + cross terms.

Wait, no, more accurately, the expectation of σx for a state |ψ⟩ = a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩ is:

⟨σx⟩ = (a b* + a* b) * ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + ( |a|^2 ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ )

But since σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ = 0 because σx is off-diagonal. Similarly for ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ = 0.

So the expectation is (a b* + a* b) * ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + (0 + 0).

But ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ is the matrix element, which is 1 because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the element is 1.

So ⟨σx⟩ = (a b* + a* b) *1.

In our case, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2, and they are real, so a* = a, b* =b.

So (a b + a b) = 2ab.

Thus, ⟨σx⟩ = 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) )= 2 * ( (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*( sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So that confirms the earlier calculation. So the expectation is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866.

So putting it all together: 10*(-0.5)= -5; 5* (0.866)=4.33. Sum is -0.67.

Rounding to one decimal place, that would be -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might have a mistake in signs or coefficients.

Wait, the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) )= (2 * 0.5 * sqrt(3) ) / 2 = (sqrt(3) ) / 2 ≈0.866, correct.

So yeah, so the expectation for σx is sqrt(3)/2. So the total expectation is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(3)/2 *5.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So 1.73205/2 ≈0.866025. Multiply by5: 0.866025 *5=4.330125.

Then, 10* (-0.5) = -5. So total is -5 +4.330125= -0.669875 ≈ -0.6699.

So that's approximately -0.67 when rounded to two decimal places, but the question says to round to one decimal place. So -0.7.

So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is given by:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is already expressed in terms of these eigenstates, so the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(1) + |b|^2(-1),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Calculating \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \):

\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a general spin-half state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab,
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively. Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2(0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the result is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
