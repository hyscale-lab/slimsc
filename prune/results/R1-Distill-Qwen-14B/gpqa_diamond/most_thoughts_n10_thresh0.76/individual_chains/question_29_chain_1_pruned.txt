Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and a drought-resistant cultivar. The problem is that this cultivar has an anti-nutritional compound, and they found the gene responsible for it. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutation. 

The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and looked at the target gene in mutants. The changes are in the beginning of the first exon. So the question is which mutation would probably let them get rid of the anti-nutritional compound.

Looking at the options, the intact gene and the mutants have their sequences given. I think I need to compare the wild-type gene with each mutant to see what kind of mutations they have and how that might affect the protein product.

So first, I should probably figure out where the changes are in each mutant. Let me look at each mutant's sequence.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. The first part is the start codon, ATG, which makes sense. The rest is the coding sequence.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’. Comparing to the intact gene, let's see. The first part after ATG is TTTCTC... in wild type, but in mutant 1 it's TTCTAC. So wait, let's index this.

Looking at the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT C G C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...

Wait, maybe I should write each position. Let me line them up.

Intact:
Positions 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
28-30: GAA
... and so on.

Mutant 1:
Positions 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: TCA (since the third triplet is now TCA instead of CTC)
Wait, wait, maybe I should look at each codon.

Wait, wait. Let me see the original sequences.

Intact gene's first part:

5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:

5’-ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, in the mutant1, the sequence after TTT is CT C, which would make the third codon CT C instead of CTC?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me see:

The intact gene: positions 4-6: TTT (the second codon is Phe), 7-9: CTC (Leu), 10-12: GCT (Ala), etc.

Mutant1: 4-6: TTT (same as wild type), 7-9: CT C (ah, maybe it's a point mutation. Wait, perhaps I should look at each nucleotide.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compare the sequences letter by letter.

Intact gene: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTG
