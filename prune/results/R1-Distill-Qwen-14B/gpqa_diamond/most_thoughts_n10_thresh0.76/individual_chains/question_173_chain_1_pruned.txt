Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, I think. Let me see what it's asking. The question is about an electron moving with a certain speed, and we're given the uncertainty in its position. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy. Hmm, right, this is Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, I remember that from my studies.

Wait, the problem states that the electron's speed is v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, but wait, no, wait a second. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp). The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But since the problem is asking about the uncertainty in energy, not momentum. Hmm, how do I connect these? Oh, right. Because the electron's kinetic energy is related to its momentum. So maybe I can find the uncertainty in momentum first and then convert that into an uncertainty in energy.

Let me jot down the steps I think I should take.

First, calculate the uncertainty in momentum Δp using the uncertainty principle. Then, since the kinetic energy E is related to momentum p by E = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. But wait, since we're dealing with uncertainties, maybe I should use differentials to find the uncertainty in energy
