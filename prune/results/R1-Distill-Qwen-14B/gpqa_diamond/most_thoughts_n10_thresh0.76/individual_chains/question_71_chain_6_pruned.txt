Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We're supposed to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2, assuming they have the same albedo.

Hmm. Right, equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were a perfect black body, right? The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) / (a^2) )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact form. Oh wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula T = T_eff * sqrt(R*/(2a)), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R* is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Oh wait, but sometimes it's presented in terms of the inverse square law, like T^4 proportional to (L/(16πσ)) * (1 - albedo) / a². Right, because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance.

Wait, but since all the planets are around the same star, the star's luminosity (L) and other factors like albedo are the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature depends inversely on the square root of the semi-major axis, because T is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2). So the formula would be T proportional to 1/sqrt(a).

But wait, the problem gives the orbital periods in a certain ratio. So we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet 4 and Planet 2.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), assuming the same star. So P² ∝ a³. Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3).

So for each planet, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So the ratio of a4 to a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3).
