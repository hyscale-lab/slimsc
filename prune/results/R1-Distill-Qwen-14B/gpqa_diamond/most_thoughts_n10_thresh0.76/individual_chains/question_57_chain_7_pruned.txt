Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering electrons and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question states that we have measured phase shifts for a scattering experiment: δ₀ =90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And the rest are ignored. The electrons are 50 MeV, and we need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, but I need to figure out the right approach.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula for f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) * (2l +1) * Pl(cosθ), summed over l. Or something like that. Wait, k is the wave number, and the sum is over angular momentum quantum numbers l.

But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So θ=0 degrees, because the incident beam direction is straight ahead. Oh, right, when θ is 0, cosθ is 1, so Pl(1) is 1 for each l, because the Legendre polynomials Pl(1) are 1 for all l. So each term becomes (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * (2l+1) * (1/(2ik)).

Wait, but the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is what we're after. So let's compute Im(f(0)).

Breaking down each term, (e^{2iδ_l} -1) can be written as e^{iδ_l}^2 - 1. Alternatively, maybe expand it as (cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l)) - 1, which becomes [cos(2δ_l) -1] + i sin(2δ_l). So each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) / (2ik).

But wait, the amplitude f is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by a sum of terms. So each term contributes (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * (2l+1) * Pl(1) = (e^{2iδ_l} -
