Okay, so I have this question about barley genetics and mutations. Let's try to figure this out step by step. 

The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for which mutation will eliminate the compound. 

Looking at the sequences, the intact gene starts with 5’-ATG... and ends with TGA-3’. The question is about which mutation disrupts the gene so the compound isn't made anymore.

So the options are Mutant 1 to 4. I need to compare each mutant's sequence with the wild-type to see where the changes are and what effect they might have.

Let me write down the wild-type and each mutant's changes:

Wild-type: 
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing to wild-type: The first part is ATGTTTCT... becomes ATGTTCTA... Let me see. Breaking it down:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, so the first few codons change. Let's see the exact change. The wild-type has the first codon ATG (start), then TTT is the next. Then CTC, then GCT, etc.

In Mutant 1, the sequence after ATG is TTC, then TAC, then GCT. So comparing:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...

So, the second codon in wild is TTT (Phe), but in Mutant1 it's TTC (also Phe). So that's same amino acid. Then the next codon: wild is CTC (Leu), Mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). Oh wait, that's a change. So the third codon in wild is CTC, which is Leu, but in Mutant1 it's TAC, which is Tyr. So that's a substitution from Leu to Tyr.

But wait, wait. Let's look at the sequences again. The wild-type is: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the first part of wild is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG
