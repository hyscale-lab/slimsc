Okay, so I have this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. Looking at the options, these are all tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzenes. So each compound must be a derivative of benzene with substituents attached.

The NMR spectrum shows two signals as singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but the mixture is 1:1, so maybe each compound contributes a singlet, but why two? Oh, because each compound in the mixture has a different environment, so each contributes a singlet, and together they show two signals in a 1:1 ratio. Or maybe each has a singlet that's integrating to a specific ratio. Hmm, maybe the protons in each compound's aromatic ring have equivalent environments, leading to a singlet. So each compound contributes one singlet, and the two together give two signals each at a certain integration.

Then, there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. At 2.2 ppm, that's typical for methyl groups attached to something, maybe CH3 groups next to an electron-withdrawing group or something. Since the options are all about methyl or ethyl substituents, perhaps the CH3 groups from the substituents are showing up there.

Now, the compounds in the options are:
1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene
2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
4. 1,4-diethylbenzene

So the possible options are pairs of these.

Let me think about each compound's structure and their NMR signals.

Starting with the aromatic protons. For each compound, how many unique sets of aromatic protons are there?

Let's imagine each structure:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: The substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. So the benzene ring has four methyl groups. Wait, that's four substituents. So the positions are 1 (let's say para to 4?), but wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1,2,4,5 would be adjacent? Let me draw it mentally. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, then 4 and 5 are adjacent as well. So perhaps it's a 1,2-dimethyl and 4,5-dimethyl arrangement. Wait, but that might lead to some symmetry. So the aromatic protons would be in certain positions. If substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then the remaining positions are 3 and 6. So the structure is a benzene ring with methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to substituents. Wait, but with four substituents, are the aromatic protons at positions 3 and 6 equivalent? Maybe. Because the structure would have some symmetry. Like, maybe positions 3 and 6 are each adjacent to two methyl groups. So each of those positions would have equivalent protons, but perhaps each has a unique chemical shift. Wait, no, because symmetry might make their shifts the same. Alternatively, maybe each of those positions has a unique shift.

Wait, let's think about the substitution pattern. If substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then the ring has two substituents on adjacent carbons (1 and 2), and another two on adjacent carbons (4 and 5). So the structure would look like this: positions 1 and 2 have methyl, then position 4 and 5 have methyl as well. So the ring has substituents in a sort of para arrangement? No
