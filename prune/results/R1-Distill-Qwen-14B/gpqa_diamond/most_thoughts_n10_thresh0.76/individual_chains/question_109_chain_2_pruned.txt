Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The Pauli statistics part is a bit tricky. The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So, T should be equal to S plus L plus 1 modulo 2.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, I think that means their isospin is zero. Now, the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each involving a transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle (p, f, s, etc.).

First, I need to think about conservation laws. Both angular momentum and parity must be conserved. So, when the NN system emits particle X, the total angular momentum and parity before and after must match.

The initial state is 1S0. Let's parse that. In general, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1, so S=0. L is S in spectroscopic notation, so L=0 (since S is the orbital quantum number here). Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Oh, wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum (not the letter), and J is the total angular momentum.

So 1S0: 2S+1=1 implies S=0. Then the next part is L=0 (since S is 0, right? Wait no, S is the spin, L is orbital. So the notation is 1S0, meaning S=0, L=0? No, wait, no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J, so the first part is 1, so S=
