Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. Alright, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors, right? So this must be a state vector. Oh, and the observable is given by a matrix operator P. 

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues represent possible measurement outcomes. So to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to determine the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them. If it is, then I can find the corresponding eigenvector and compute the probability.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, maybe I should find the expectation value or something else. Hmm, no, the probability is about when the measurement yields exactly 0, so I think I'm on the right track with eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let me first write down the matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So the matrix is 3x3. Let me write it out:

P = 
[ 0        1/√2      0      ]
[1/√2      0       1/√2   ]
[ 0        1/√2      0      ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are solutions to the equation det(P - λI) = 0. So the characteristic equation is the determinant of (P - λI) equals zero.

Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's try. The matrix P - λI is:

[ -λ      1/√2      0       ]
[1/√2   -λ      1/√2     ]
[ 0      1/√2     -λ      ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, maybe I should expand along the first row for simplicity.

The determinant is:

-λ * ( (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) 
- (1/√2) * ( (1/√2)(-λ) - 0*(1/√2) )
+ 0 * something

So let's compute each part:

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] = -λ³ + (λ)(1/2)

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ (-λ / √2) - 0 ] = -(1/√2)( -λ / √2 ) = (λ)/(2) 

Third term is zero.

So the determinant becomes:

(-λ³ + (λ/2)) + (λ/2) ) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ.

Set this equal to zero: -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) =0.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1. 

So the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1. So the question is about the probability of measuring 0. That means we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 and then compute the inner product with the given state vector.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to 0.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, each eigenvector (for a Hermitian operator) gives an eigenstate. So I need to find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0. So we solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the equations are:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) =0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3=0 → same as row 1, so v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2 must be zero.

From row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvector can be written as v = [v1, 0, v3]^T, with v1 = -v3.

Let me let v3 = t (a parameter), then v1 = -t. So the eigenvector is v = [ -t, 0, t ]^T = t [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [ -1, 0, 1 ].

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because when I substituted, I found v2=0, and v1 = -v3. So any vector of the form (-t, 0, t) is an eigenvector for λ=0.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [-1, 0, 1]. Wait, but wait, let me check if this is correct. Let me plug this vector into P.

Let me take the vector v = [-1, 0, 1]^T.

Compute P v:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(0) + 0*(1) = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(0) + (1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2) )=0.

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(0) + 0*(1) = 0.

So P v = [0,0,0]^T, which is λ=0 times v. So yes, this vector is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenvector is [-1, 0, 1]^T? Hmm, wait no, because when I substituted, I found that the eigenvectors are of the form [ -t, 0, t ] which is same as t [ -1, 0, 1 ]. So that's correct.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, and the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [-1,0,1]^T.

Now, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the norm is sqrt(6), which is more than 1. So to get the correct state, perhaps I should normalize it. Wait, but in this problem, perhaps it's not necessary because the probability calculation might not require normalization, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as a column matrix, but I should check if it's normalized. Let me compute the sum of squares: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1=6 → magnitude squared is 6. So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

But wait, the problem states that the state is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). So perhaps it's the unnormalized state. But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically unit vectors, so maybe the state should be normalized. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the given vector, but keep in mind that it's not normalized. Alternatively, maybe I can proceed without normalizing because the probability would involve the squared amplitude, which would take into account the normalization.

But maybe I should proceed normally. So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a column vector, so this is correct.

The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to 0 in the state |ψ>.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is |v0> = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. But wait, earlier I found that the eigenvector is a multiple of [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, which I can write as (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, perhaps, but the exact normalization isn't clear yet. Wait, let's compute the norm of [ -1, 0, 1 ] to find the normalization factor.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 0^2 +1^2 = 1+0+1=2 → norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.

So |v0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].

Now, the state |ψ> is given as [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, but wait, perhaps the state is not normalized. The norm of |ψ> is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(6), so |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].

But when calculating probabilities, we can use the unnormalized vector if we adjust the probability accordingly. Let me think: the probability P is |<v0 | ψ>|^2 / ( <ψ|ψ> ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if |ψ> is not normalized, then the probabilities would sum to |<ψ|ψ>|^2,
