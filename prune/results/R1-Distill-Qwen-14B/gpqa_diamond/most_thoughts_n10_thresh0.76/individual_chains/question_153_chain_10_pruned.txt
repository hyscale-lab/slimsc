Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to determine the major products.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics, but I know that dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate. The acceptor here is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. In a typical Michael addition, the nucleophilic enolate attacks the beta position of the acceptor.

So, dimethyl malonate would act as the nucleophile. It has two ester groups, so when deprotonated, it can attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me draw this out mentally. The acceptor has a structure like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, noâ€”the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Or is it perhaps (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOEt? No, wait, the formula is usually CH2=CH-COR. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OEt with the p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon. Wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2COOEt? Wait, maybe not. Let me think: acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon, but wait, acrylate is only three carbons: CH2-CH2-COOEt? No, CH2=CH-CO-OEt. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the CH2 part? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OEt, with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt? Or wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So the 3-position would be the end with the COOR group. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, which is the COOR part. Oh wait, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. That would be 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. But I'm a bit confused about the structure, but perhaps I can proceed.

So the Michael donor is dimethyl malonate, which is CH2(CO2Me)2. When it forms the enolate, it's a strong nucleophile. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acceptor. So the acceptor is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so the enolate would attack the gamma position? Wait, no, in Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the beta position (the one next to the carbonyl), which
