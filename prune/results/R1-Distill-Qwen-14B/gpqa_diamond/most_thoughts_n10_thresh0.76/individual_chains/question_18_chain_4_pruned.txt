Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

So there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if the masses matter here. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

The given data includes some abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. And [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. 

Wait, what do these brackets mean again? Oh right, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the elements in the star compared to the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So I can calculate the solar ratios for Fe/H and Mg/H.

Let me write down the Sun's values first.

For the Sun, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5, so nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Wait, but wait. Oh, the way it's written is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So yeah, same as before.

Now, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun =0. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So nFe/nH =10^(-4.5) in Star_1.

And [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3.

Wait, so in the Sun, log10(nSi/nFe) would be log10(nSi_sun / nFe_sun). Oh wait, but I don't have the solar silicon abundance directly. Hmm, maybe I can figure it out.

Alternatively, let's think about [Si/Fe] in Star_1. So [Si/Fe] = log(Si/Fe)_star - log(Si/Fe)_sun =0.3.

So (Si/Fe)_star = (Si/Fe)_sun *10^(0.3).

But I don't know (Si/Fe)_sun. Wait, perhaps I can compute it from the Sun's other abundances.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0, so
