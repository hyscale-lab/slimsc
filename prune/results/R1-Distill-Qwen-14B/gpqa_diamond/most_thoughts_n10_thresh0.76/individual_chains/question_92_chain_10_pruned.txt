Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation for some organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds, probably a diene or something more complex. But wait, the question is about enthalpy of formation, not structure analysis. So maybe I can focus on the bonds.

The problem provides some bond energies:
- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, atomization? Oh, right, that's the energy required to break a C atom from its standard state, which is graphite, into gaseous atoms. So each C atom would require 1000 kJ/mol to atomize.

But wait, when calculating enthalpy of formation, I think there's a standard approach. The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. For organic compounds, that would typically be from carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas.

The formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = Σ [Bond energies of all bonds broken in reactants] - Σ [Bond energies of all bonds formed in products]

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Because
