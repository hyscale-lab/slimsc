Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't just use classical mechanics formulas. I think I need to use the relativistic addition formula for velocities and the relativistic energy equations.

Wait, right, the relative speed isn't as simple as subtracting the two speeds. Because at high speeds, classical addition doesn't hold. Oh yeah, the formula for relative velocity in relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So I should apply that here.

Let's plug in the values. The first astronaut's speed is 0.6c, and the second is 0.5c. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Plugging in: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²). Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.6c -0.5c=0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1-0.3=0.7.

So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.1428c approximately. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's a match.

Next part: the total energy of the system. Wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies. Each astronaut's energy is gamma*m*c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36)=1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25*2m c²=2.5 m c².

The second astronaut has mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)= approximately 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 *3m c²= 1.1547 *3 m c². Let me calculate that: 3*1.1547 is about 3.4641 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 +3.4641=5.9641 m c². Looking at options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. D has 5, which is too low. So the energy is about 5.96 mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c and energy around 5.96 mc². That would be option C.

Wait, let me double-check the velocities. The formula is right because both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed is correct. And for energies, yes, each is calculated correctly. So the answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

1. **Numerator**: \(0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
2. **Denominator**: \(1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

This rounds to \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass: \(2m\), Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass: \(3m\), Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(E = 5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**

Answer: C
