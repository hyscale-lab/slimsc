Alright, so I have this NMR question in front of me. Let's try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question says that a solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm. So aromatic compounds, so probably substituted benzene rings. The molecular formula C10H14. Wait, benzene is C6H6. So the substituents must add up to C4H8. Because 6 carbons in benzene plus 4 in substituents makes 10. And for hydrogen, benzene has 6, substituents adding 8, so 14 total. Substituents would be likely alkyl groups, because aromatic rings with substituents like methyl or ethyl would make sense.

Looking at the options, the compounds are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C which includes diethylbenzene. So options A, B, D are all benzene rings with four methyl groups. Option C has one diethyl group and the rest? Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would be benzene with two ethyl groups. So total substituents would be C4H8 (each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls would be C4H10, but wait, attached to benzene, it's C4H10? No wait, benzene has 6 C, each substituent is -CH2CH3. So two substituents would add 2*(2 carbons) = 4 C, and H? Each ethyl has 5 H? Wait, no, when attached to benzene, each ethyl group is a substituent. Each ethyl is CH2CH3, but when attached to benzene, it's -CH2CH3. So each ethyl contributes 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since one H is attached to the benzene and the rest are in the CH2 and CH3). So two ethyl groups would contribute 4 C and 10 H. So benzene (6 C, 6 H) plus two ethyl groups (4 C, 10 H) makes C10H16. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, that can't be right. So maybe that's a problem. Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have molecular formula C8H10, because benzene is C6H6, each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls would be C4H10. So total C6+4=10, H6+10=16. But the compound here has C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have H16, which doesn't match. So option C is probably not correct because it's diethylbenzene, which would give H16, but the given formula is C10H14. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check:

Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is CH3, so four methyl groups would add 4*(CH3) = C4H12. So benzene plus four methyl groups would be C10H18? Wait, no: benzene has 6 H. Each methyl group replaces a H, so each CH3 adds 3 H. So four methyl groups add 4*3=12 H, but benzene has 6 H. So total H would be 6 + 12 = 18? Wait, no, wait. Benzene has 6 H. When you add substituents, each substituent replaces a hydrogen. So for each substituent, the number of H on the benzene decreases by one, but the substituent brings its own H.

Wait, actually, to compute the molecular formula, benzene is C6H6. Each substituent R replaces a H. So for each R group, the molecular formula becomes C6+R C and H6 -1 + R H. So for a methyl group (CH3), R is CH3, so each substitution increases C by 1, H by 3 -1 = 2 (because CH3 has 3 H, and you lose one H from benzene). So for four methyl groups, four substitutions: 4*(+1 C) = +4 C, 4*(+2 H) = +8 H. So benzene is C6H6. After four methyl groups, it's C10H14. Oh, okay, that makes sense. So each tetramethylbenzene is C10H14. So the compounds in options A, B, D are all C10H14. Option C's 1,4-diethylbenzene: each ethyl group is C2H5. So two ethyl groups would be adding 2*2=4 C, and each ethyl brings 5 H. But wait, each substitution replaces a H, so each ethyl substitution adds (5 H -1 H) =4 H. So two ethyls add 8 H. Benzene is C6H6. So for diethylbenzene, C6+4= C10, H6 +8=14. So the formula is C10H14. Oh! So all options are C10H14, so that's okay.

So that means all options are possible.
