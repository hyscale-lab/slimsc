Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem has two parts, A and B, and I need to select the correct major products for each. The options are given, so I'll need to figure out each reaction separately and then match them.

First, reaction A:
It's 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with acrylates, it's typically an example of a Claisen condensation. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, so this might be a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a cyclic ketone. And ethyl acrylate is an enolate donor? Or acceptor? Oh wait, in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, the ketone may form an enolate. Alternatively, ethyl acrylate can act as a nucleophile in a conjugate addition.

Wait, another possibility: this is a Diels-Alder reaction? Because ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester which can act as a dienophile. But wait, the starting material is a ketone, not a diene. So maybe not Diels-Alder.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cycloaddition, but I'm not sure. Another thought: the ketone is undergoing some kind of addition. Oh, wait, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1. That would be position 1 as the carbonyl, so the ring is cyclohexane with substituents at 2 (ethyl), 2 (another methyl?), wait no. Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, substituents are at positions 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl), and another methyl at 2? Wait, 2,
