Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. But wait, how exactly does it work? Oh right, the decay follows an exponential law. The key point is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed; it's memoryless. So, if the atom hasn't decayed for some time, the chance it will decay in the next interval is the same as if it had just started.

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that's the probability that the atom will decay in 100 minutes from when it's created, I guess. But wait, the problem is a bit different. So, the atom was obtained, and 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Now, we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait. 50 have passed, and we're looking at the next 150. So the total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes? Or is it 150 minutes from now?

Right, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. So the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes.

But wait, let me think. Since the decay process is memoryless, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability. So for the purpose of calculating the probability over the next 150 minutes, it's as if we're starting fresh now. Or is there another way to look at it?

Alternatively, maybe the given 32% is the decay probability for 100 minutes. So if the probability P(t) is given by 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So, the probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32.

Let me find λ first. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Then, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, but ln(0.
