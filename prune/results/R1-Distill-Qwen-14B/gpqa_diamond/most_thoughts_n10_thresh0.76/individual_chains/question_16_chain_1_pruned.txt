Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each compound one by one. Optical activity usually means the compound has chiral centers, right? Or maybe some other form of asymmetry like in allenes or something.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm. Let me draw its structure. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no wait. Wait, butene is four carbons. Wait, structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, which is also the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, the but-1-ene has four carbons, so the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait no, but the double bond is between 1 and 2, so the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So it's Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the
