Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an aromatic compound based on its spectral data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, I'm thinking benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific peaks, usually around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch and around 1250-1050 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch. So the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's parse them. Two are aromatic-H, which probably means the substituents are in positions that cause two different types of H environments on the ring. The ring itself is disubstituted, so maybe para or ortho? Wait, if it's para, the ring would have two equivalent H's on each side, but that might give fewer signals. Hmm, but wait, if the substituents are such that the ring isn't symmetric, maybe they're in positions that split the aromatic Hs into two different environments. Like maybe one substituent is ortho to another, causing different coupling.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, another a doublet of quartets. Vinyl Hs are typically in alkenes. So perhaps there's an ester group with a vinyl group attached. Ester groups are R-O-CO-O-R, but wait no, esters are R-O-CO-R', right? So maybe the ester is part of a substituent on the aromatic ring. Oh, wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a substituent that's a vinyl group, like maybe an allyl ester or something with a double bond adjacent.

Wait, the vinyl-Hs: one is a doublet, which could mean coupling with one neighbor (maybe a trans coupling), and the other is a doublet of quartets—so perhaps this H is coupling with two different sets of Hs. Maybe it's adjacent to an ethyl group, like CH₂CH₂, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's part of a more complex structure.

Also, two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. And no signals for –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any -CH2- groups. That could mean that any CH2 groups are either part of a ring (like in cyclohexane), but the aromatic ring is six-membered and presumably all carbons are part of the aromatic structure. So maybe the substituents have CH3 groups but no CH2.

Putting this together: the compound likely has an aromatic ring, two substituents, one of which is an ester group. Let's think about possible structures.

Ester groups would come from an acid and an alcohol. So if it's an ester on the benzene ring, maybe it's something like a benzyl ester or a phenyl ester. But wait, benzene rings can't rotate, so the substitution pattern matters.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted. So two substituents. One is the ester group, and the other? Maybe another methyl group or another ester group? But the ester group would have oxygen, so perhaps another substituent which is an ester.

Alternatively, the substituents could be an ester and something else, maybe a vinyl group, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the vinyl Hs: perhaps the ester is part of a vinyl group attached to the ring. For example, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOOR attached to the ring. But that would bring in more carbons and maybe more signals. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group connected via a double bond.

Wait, another approach: the NMR tells us about the substituents. The presence of two –CH3 groups suggests that there are two methyl groups attached somewhere. The vinyl Hs could be part of a double bond attached to the ring or part of the ester structure.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, the structure is O-C-O where it's connected to a carbonyl. So the ester group is O-CO-O-R? No, I think I'm getting confused. The ester is R-O-CO-R', right? So for example, methyl propanoate would be CH3CH2COOCH3.

So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R. Wait, but that would require an ortho, meta, or para position.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, like OMe-CO-O- attached to the ring. But that might not fit the NMR data. Alternatively, the substituent could be a vinyl ester, such as CH2=CHCOOR attached to the ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So perhaps the ester is something like CH2CH2COOCH3, but that might not fit.

Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For option A: C11H14O2. DoU: (2*11 +2 -14)/2= (24-14)/2=5. 5 DoU could be a benzene ring (3) + ester (1 for the carbonyl) + maybe a double bond (1), so that adds up. But Wait, benzene is 3 DoU (three double bonds). Ester has one (the carbonyl). And a double bond would be another, so 3+1+1=5.

Option D: C11H12O2. DoU: (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6. So that's 6 DoU. That could be benzene (3) + ester (1) + another ring or double bond (2 more?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the ring is aromatic which is already 3 DoU, the ester is another, and any double bonds would add.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl Hs, which are part of a double bond. So that gives another DoU.

So, let's calculate for each option:

A) C11H14O2 DoU: (22+2-14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 DoU. Benzene (3) + ester (1 for carbonyl) + 1 double bond = 5. That works.

D) C11H12O2: DoU=(22+2-12)/2= (24-12)/2=6. That would be benzene (3) + ester (1) + another double bond (1) + another ring or something else. But wait, the compound is a di-substituted benzene, so no rings beyond the aromatic ring. So maybe a double bond (vinyl) and the ester, totaling 3+1+1=5. So maybe DoU is 5, so option D would have 6 DoU, which would require another double bond or ring? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another approach: the aromatic ring (6 carbons, 3 double bonds) uses 3 DoU. The ester group has a carbonyl, which is a double bond → 1 DoU. The vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) has a double bond → another DoU. So that's 3+1+1=5 DoU.

So the molecule must have 5 DoU. So which options have 5 DoU?

Let's calculate each option:

A) C11H14O2: (22+2-14)/2= (24-14)=10 →10/2=5. So 5 DoU. This fits.

B) C12H14O2: (24+2-14)=12 →12/2=6. No.

C) C12H12O2: (24+2-12)=14 →14/2=7. No.

D) C11H12O2: (22+2-12)=12 →12/2=6. No.

So only option A has 5 DoU. So the correct formula must be C11H14O2, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. The NMR shows aromatic Hs, so perhaps the substitution is such that there are two distinct aromatic H environments. For a di-substituted benzene, the substitution can be para, meta, or ortho. If para, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two equivalent Hs on each ring position. But if it's meta, the substituents are 1,3, leading to more complex splitting. Alternatively, if the substituents are different, the ring could have two sets of Hs. For example, if one substituent is an ester and the other is a methyl group, and they're in para positions, would that lead to two sets of Hs?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are both ester groups, but that might complicate the structure.

Wait, the NMR also shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. So perhaps the ester is connected to a methyl group, and another substituent is a methyl group.

Wait, but the ester group is R-O-CO-O-R' ? No, wait, no. The ester is R-O-CO-R'. So for example, methyl benzoate would be an ester where R is methyl and R' is phenyl. So in that case, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene ring. Wait, no, wait: no, wait, methyl benzoate is an ester where the benzene is connected via the oxygen. Wait, methyl benzoate structure is benzoyl-OCH3. So the structure is O=C(OCH3) attached to the benzene.

In this case, the substituent on the benzene would be O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Let me correct that. The structure of methyl benzoate is benzene ring connected to an ester group. The ester group is O-CO-OCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, the correct structure is benzene-O-CO-OCH3? No, that would be a carbonate. Wait, no. An ester is formed from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. So for benzoic acid and methanol, the ester would be benzene ring connected to a -O-CO-OCH3 group? No, wait, no. Wait, no: the structure is benzene ring connected to a -CO-OCH3 group. Because in esters, the structure is RCOOR'. So for benzoic acid (RCOOR', where R is benzene and R' is methyl), the ester would be benzoyl-OCH3. So the benzene ring is attached to a carbonyl group (CO), which is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a methyl group.

So in that case, the substituent is a -COOCH3 group attached to the benzene ring.

That substituent (COOCH3) would itself have a methyl group (the OCH3 part). So in the NMR, the methyl group in the ester would show up as a singlet, since the methyl is attached to oxygen and not split by any neighboring protons. But in this problem, the NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So perhaps the substituent is not just a single methyl, but another methyl elsewhere.

Wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So the molecule has two different methyl groups. So perhaps the ester is connected to a branching that has another methyl.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is something like CH2CH3, but that would be ethyl, but the problem says no CH2 signals. So that can't be it. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester.

Wait, another thought. If the substituent is an ester group that's part of a vinyl group, like CH₂=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene. But then, the vinyl would have its own protons, and the ester would have a methyl group. But then, the aromatic substituents would be the vinyl ester and perhaps another group.

Wait, but the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methoxy group (OCH3) and an ester group. But then, the ester would have another OCH3, but that would make two –OCH3 groups, which would both be singlets. But the question says two –CH3 signals, not OCH3. So maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group (CH3-) and another is an ester group. So the benzene has a methyl group and a COOCH3 group as substituents.

So in that case, the methyl group (CH3-) attached to the benzene would be a singlet, and the OCH3 in the ester would also be a singlet. So in the NMR, that would be two singlets for the –CH3 groups. But in the problem statement, the two –CH3 groups are split into two signals. So perhaps they are in different environments, leading to different shifts.

Wait, but regardless, the problem says two –CH3 signals. So perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and another group that has a methyl group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the structure again.

The ester group is present, so the formula must include O2. The options are C11H14O2, etc.

Wait, considering the molecular formula. Let's say the base is benzene (C6H6). The two substituents add up to (n carbons) and some hydrogens.

Each substituent is probably an ester group and another group.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows six signals. Let's think about how that breaks down.

Two aromatic H signals. So the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have two distinct types of Hs. For example, para substitution with two different substituents. So if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B at position 3, that's meta, but not sure.

Wait, di-substituted benzene with two different substituents could lead to two sets of aromatic Hs. For example, if substituents are para, the two Hs on each side would be equivalent, leading to one signal. But if substituents are meta, maybe the symmetry is different. Alternatively, if substituents are ortho, perhaps the Hs are split into two.

But I'm not too confident about the exact splitting. Let me think of an example: if the substituents are para, and they're different, then the ring would have two sets of Hs: the Hs ortho to substituent A would be one set, and those meta would be another. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps two substituents in the para position would split the Hs into two sets. Maybe.

Then, the vinyl Hs: two signals—one is a doublet, another a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent. For example, a substituent like CH2CH2COOCH3 but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, a substituent like CH2=CHCOOR attached to the ring.

Wait, let's think about a structure where the benzene ring has a substituent that includes a vinyl group and an ester group. Like, maybe an allyl ester or something. For example, the substituent is -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that's more of an ether. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's not a vinyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not a vinyl group. Alternatively, the substituent is -CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl ester, which doesn't have a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, such as CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So the structure is benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's a propyl ester. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected via an ester. Like, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3 attached to the benzene. But that would have more complexity.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3. But that would introduce more CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR. Because the NMR says no –CH2 signals. So that structure might not fit.

Wait, the NMR shows no –CH2 groups. So any substituents cannot have CH2. So substituents can only have CH3 or CH groups.

So maybe the substituent is an ester group where the R' is a vinyl group. Like, R-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that has a CH2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOOR attached to the benzene. So the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's propyl. Alternatively, O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-, connected to the ring. But then where is the ester group?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group (OCH3) and a vinyl ester group. But that would complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and a vinyl ester group. Let me think about that.

Wait, another approach: the ester group contributes a carbonyl (C=O), and in the NMR, the vinyl Hs are part of a double bond adjacent to the ester group. So maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that would require the substituent to be -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is an ethyl ester, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the NMR signals again.

The aromatic Hs are two signals. So the ring has two different types of Hs. Since it's a disubstituted benzene, let's think about the substitution pattern.

In a para-disubstituted benzene with two different substituents, the Hs would be in two sets: the two Hs adjacent to substituent A and the two Hs adjacent to substituent B, but if the substituents are in para, the ring could have some symmetry leading to fewer signals. Alternatively, if substituents are meta, the splitting could be more complex.

But I'm not too sure about the exact splitting. Maybe the two substituents are an ester group and a methyl group, leading to two different types of Hs.

The vinyl Hs: one is a doublet, another a doublet of quartets. So maybe the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the substituent could be a vinyl group attached directly to the ring, and the ester is part of another substituent. For example, benzene has a substituent which is an ester (like O-CO-OCH3) and another substituent which is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). But that would require another substituent. Wait, but the substituent is di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is the ester group, and the other is a vinyl group.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, but if R is a vinyl group, that would be a vinyl ester substituent.

Wait, the substituent would be O-CO-O-R, where R is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2. But that doesn't make sense because R would need to be an alkyl or aryl group.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that's a vinyl group. For example, the substituent is a vinyl ester, such as CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the ring. So the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's a propyl group, but then the vinyl would be from where? Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's butyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring or something, but that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an aromatic group with a vinyl ester. But I'm not getting closer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester and a vinyl group. No, that would require more substituents.

Wait, the substituent itself is an ester. So, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which is an ethyl ester. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR. So that's not possible.

Wait, unless the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2, but that would have a branching without CH2 groups. That would have two –CH3 groups, perhaps.

Wait, let me think. If the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2, then the structure would be:

Benzene-O-CO-O-C(CH3)2? No, that's a carbonate. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is benzene and R' is O-C(CH3)2, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe R' is CH(CH3)2. So substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. So that would make the substituent an ester where the R' is a tertiary butyl group (CH2CH(CH3)2?), no, wait, sorry.

Wait, another approach. Let's count the number of carbons.

The molecular formula options are C11H14O2, C11H12O2, etc.

The benzene ring has 6 carbons. The two substituents must add up to (n) and (m), so 6 + n + m = total carbons.

If the substituents are an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and a methyl group, then the ester R would be, say, methyl, so the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3. So the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (methyl) + 3 (ester O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, O-CO-OCH3 is part of the substituent.

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3. That's 3 carbons (O, C, O, CH3). Wait, but O's don't count as carbons. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 carbons (the COOCH3 group has 3 carbons: COO- is two, plus the methyl makes three).

So the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 3 (ester substituent) + 1 (methyl substituent) = 10 carbons. But the options given are C11, C12, etc. So that's 10, which is less than the options. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoyloxy group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is an ethyl ester. That would have 3 carbons in the substituent. So 6 + 3 + ... Wait, but that's 9. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a butyl ester. That would add 4 carbons. So 6 + 4 = 10, still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2. No, that's branching, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecular formula. Take option A, C11H14O2. Benzene has 6 carbons. The substituents would add 5 carbons. So two substituents, each contributing, say, 3 and 2 carbons. But the substituents can't have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group (1 C) and an ester group (which would have 4 carbons: COOCH3 is 3, but that's 3). So 6 + 1 (methyl) + 3 (ester) = 10. Not matching 11.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl ester, but that would include CH2.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR shows two –CH3 groups. Each must be attached in a different environment. So perhaps one is a methyl attached to oxygen (like OCH3) and another is a methyl attached to a carbon, like CH2CH3. Wait, but that would introduce a CH2 group, which isn't present. So maybe the two CH3 are both attached to oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps one is a methyl attached to the ring, and the other is part of an ester group.

Wait, let's imagine the substituents are a methyl group and a propenoate ester group. So the structure would be benzene with a –CH3 and a –O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 substituent. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not present. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the ring, and the ester is part of another substituent. But then, the ester would need to be attached without any CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -COOCH2CH3 group. That's an ethyl ester, which would have a CH2, which is not allowed. So that's out.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a cyclopropyl ester, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and a vinyl ester group. Wait, but that's two substituents on the ring, so the substituents would be a methyl and a vinyl ester group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group (–CH3) and a –O-CO-CH2CH2 group. No, that would have CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –COOCH2CH3 group, but that has CH2.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

Option A: C11H14O2.

Benzene (6C, 6H) + substituents: 5C and 8H.

Each substituent adds some C and H.

Wait, substituents are two groups. Let's say substituent 1 is COOCH3 (ester), which is 3C and 3H (OCH3). Substituent 2 is CH3, which is 1C and 3H. So total substituents: 4C and 6H. Benzene has 6C, so total is 6+4=10C, but option A is 11C. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is COOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester): that's 4C (COOCH2CH3: 3 from COO and 2 from ethyl). So substituent 1: 4C, 5H (COO has 2 O's, ethyl has 5 H? Wait, COOCH2CH3 has:

COO would be O=C(O-) , but in ester it's O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. So for ethyl ester, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, that's a carbonate. No, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is the benzene substituent. So substituent is –O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, no. The substituent is –O-CO-R', where R' is ethyl.

So substituent is –O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, no. The ester group is O-CO-R', where R' is ethyl. So substituent is –O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me get this straight.

The ester is formed from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. For methyl benzoate, the structure is benzene ring connected to a –O-CO-OCH3 group. No, wait, no. For methyl benzoate, it's benzoic acid (Ar-COOH) esterified with methanol, so it's Ar-COOCH3. So the substituent is –COOCH3.

So substituent is –COOCH3, which has 3 carbons (the COO has two, plus CH3). So that's substituent 1.

Substituent 2: perhaps a vinyl group. But a vinyl group is CH2=CH–. So substituent 2 would be –CH2CH2? No, that can't be right.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a methyl group, –CH3. So substituents are –COOCH3 and –CH3.

So benzene has 6C, substituents add 3 (COOCH3) + 1 (CH3) = 4, total 10C. But option A is C11H14O2. So 11C. So that's 10C in the molecule, but the option is 11. So something's missing.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a methyl group and substituent 1 is a propenoate ester, like –COOCH2CH2CH3. But that would have a CH2, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is –COOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl ester), which has 5C, but that brings in CH2.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me instead think about the possible structures that would give the required NMR signals.

The NMR shows two aromatic Hs, two vinyl Hs, and two CH3 signals.

The ester group would have a carbonyl, and the vinyl would be part of a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, such as –CH2–COOCH3 attached to the ring. So the structure would be benzene-CH2–COOCH3. But that would have a CH2 group, which isn't allowed. So that's out.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring attached to an ester. But that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a phenyl ester. Like, the substituent is –O-CO-Ph. But that would add more carbons and another aromatic ring, which may not fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –COOCH2CH3 group, but that has CH2, which is not allowed.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a –COO–(CH2)0– group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm really stuck on this. Let me try to think about the molecular formula again.

Option A: C11H14O2.

Benzene (6C) plus substituents: 5C.

Each substituent must add up to 5C. So two substituents adding together to 5C. So perhaps substituents are 3C and 2C.

But substituents can't have CH2 groups. So maybe the substituents are a methyl group (1C) and an ester group with 4C.

Wait, substituent 1: methyl (1C, 3H).

Substituent 2: ester group like –O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, but that has CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2: –O-CO-CH(CH3)2. That would be a branching without CH2.

So substituent 2: –O-CO-C(CH3)2. So:

COO contributes 2C, and C(CH3)2 contributes 1 C and 6 H. So substituent 2 has 3C (2 from COO, 1 from C(CH3)2). Wait, no, the COO is part of the substituent. Let me count:

The substituent is –O-CO-C(CH3)2. So O-CO is 2C, C(CH3)2 is 1C. So substituent 2 is 3C in total.

So substituent 1 (methyl) is 1C, substituent 2 is 3C. Total substituents: 4C. Benzene is 6C. Total is 10C. But option A is 11C. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is –O-CO-CH(CH3)CH2. No, that's longer.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be –O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, but that introduces CH2.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is –O-CO-CH(CH3)2. That's a tertiary butyl ester.

So substituent 2 would be 4C: the COO is 2C, and CH(CH3)2 is 2C. Wait, COO is 2C, then the R' in the ester would be CH(CH3)2, which is 3C (the ester is O-CO-O-R', but wait no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So substituent is –O-CO-R', and R' is CH(CH3)2. So R' has 3C (the CH(CH3)2 is 3C: the central C, two CH3). So substituent 2 is 3C (COO is 2C, R' is 1C? No, R' is CH(CH3)2, which is 3C. So substituent 2 is 3C (from R') plus COO's 2C, making substituent 2 5C? No, wait, the substituent is –O-CO-R', so R' is CH(CH3)2, which is 3C. So substituent 2 has 3C (R') + 2C (O-CO-), totaling 5C. Substituent 1 is methyl (1C). So total substituents are 6C. Plus benzene's 6C, that's 12C. Which doesn't match any option. Hmm.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about the degrees of unsaturation again. For option A, C11H14O2 has DoU 5. Benzene is 3, ester is 1, vinyl is 1. So that adds up. So the structure must have these.

So the structure must have a benzene ring, an ester group, and a vinyl group.

Now, putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. So the substituent is –O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that has CH2. No, can't be.

Wait, the substituent could be a –COOCH2CH2CH2 group, but again, CH2 is present.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –COOCH2CH2 group, but that's again CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –COOCH(CH3)2. That would be O-CO-O-C(CH3)2. So substituent is –O-CO-C(CH3)2. So the substituents are –O-CO-C(CH3)2 and –CH3. But that would again not add up to the correct C count.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –COOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), but that includes CH2, which is not allowed.

Wait, the NMR shows no CH2 signals, but the vinyl Hs are present. So substituent can't have any CH2 groups.

So substituent must be a vinyl group without any CH2. Like, perhaps a substituent is –CH2CH2– but that's impossible without CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2– group attached to the ring, but that would have CH2, which is not allowed. So it must be a vinyl group attached directly.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2– group, but that's a single bond. So if the substituent is a –CH2– group, that's CH2, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH=CH– group attached to the ring. So the substituent is –CH2–CH2–, but that's impossible without CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a –CH=CH– group, but that's a double bond. So the substituent is a vinyl group. So the structure is benzene with a –CH=CH– substituent and an ester group.

Wait, but the substituent would have to be –O-CO– something.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH=CH– group connected to an ester. So perhaps it's –O-CO-CH2-CH2–, but that brings in CH2.

Wait, I'm so stuck. Let me think of the possible structures that fit the options.

Option A: C11H14O2.

Molecular formula: 11 carbons, 14 hydrogens, 2 oxygens.

So, benzene (6C) plus substituents: 5C.

Two substituents: perhaps a methyl group (1C) and a butyl ester (4C), but butyl has CH2.

Alternatively, substituents could be a methyl (1C) and a propenoyloxy group (3C?), but not sure.

Alternatively, substituents could be a methyl and a –COOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester, 4C). But ethyl ester has CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is a methyl, substituent 2 is –O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (but that has CH2).

Alternatively, substituent 2 is –O-CO-CH(CH3)2 (3C). So substituent 1: methyl (1C), substituent 2: O-CO-CH(CH3)2 (3C). So total substituents: 4C. 6 (benzene) +4=10C. Not matching 11.

Hmm. So what's another possibility? Maybe substituent 2 is –O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl ester, 5C). So substituent 1: methyl (1C), substituent 2: 5C. Total substituents: 6C. Benzene:6 +6=12C. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a –COOCH(CH3)2 group. So O-CO-O-C(CH3)2? No, that's a carbonate. No, ester would be O-CO-R', R' being C(CH3)2. So substituent 2 would be O-CO-CH(CH3)2. So substituent 2 is 3C (COO) + 3C (CH(CH3)2) = 6C. Substituent 1: methyl (1C). Total substituents: 7C. Benzene:6 → 13C. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester. So substituent is –CH2–CH2–COOCH3. But that has CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –COOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl ester, 5C). Substituent 1: methyl (1C). Total substituents:6C. Benzene:6 →12C. No option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one substituent is a –CH3 and the other is a –O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's 5C and includes CH2.

I think I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the NMR again.

The two –CH3 groups: perhaps one is from a methyl ester (OCH3) and the other is a methyl group attached to the ring.

So in substituent 1: –CH3 (on ring), substituent 2: –O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester). But that has a CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is –O-CO-CH(CH3)2. Then substituent 2 would be O-CO-CH(CH3)2. So substituent 2: 3C (COO) + 3C (CH(CH3)2) → 6C? No, substituent 2 is O-CO-CH(CH3)2 → 3C (COO has 2C, CH(CH3)2 has 1C). So substituent 2 has 3C. substituent 1: methyl (1C). So total substituents:4C. Benzene:6 →10C. Not option A (11).

Wait, what if substituent 2 is –O-CO-CH(CH3)CH2? No, that's another CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is –O-CO-CH2CH2. No, that's another CH2.

I think I'm stuck again. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that option A is the correct answer because it has the correct degrees of unsaturation and the other options don't fit.


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectral data. The compound contains an ester group (evident from the FTIR spectrum), and the 1H NMR spectrum provides additional information about the structure:

1. **FTIR Data**: The presence of an ester group is confirmed by characteristic absorption peaks for the carbonyl (C=O) and C-O bonds.

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - **Two aromatic-H signals**: This suggests that the di-substitution on the benzene ring creates two distinct environments for the aromatic protons.
   - **Two vinyl-H signals**: One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets, indicating the presence of a vinyl group (C=C) with specific coupling patterns.
   - **Two –CH3 signals**: The compound contains two distinct methyl groups.
   - **No –CH2 signals**: The compound does not contain any methylene groups.

3. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**:
   - The molecular formula must account for the benzene ring (3 DoU), the ester group (1 DoU), and the vinyl group (1 DoU), totaling 5 DoU.
   - Calculating DoU for each option:
     - **A) C11H14O2**: \( \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 11 + 2 - 14)}{2} = 5 \), which matches the required 5 DoU.
     - **B) C12H14O2**: \( \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2 - 14)}{2} = 6 \), which is inconsistent.
     - **C) C12H12O2**: \( \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 7 \), which is inconsistent.
     - **D) C11H12O2**: \( \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 11 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 6 \), which is inconsistent.

4. **Structural Considerations**:
   - The compound must contain a benzene ring, an ester group, and a vinyl group.
   - The absence of –CH2 signals in the NMR spectrum rules out any substituents containing methylene groups.
   - The presence of two –CH3 signals indicates two distinct methyl groups, likely from the ester and another substituent.

Based on the analysis, **C11H14O2** (Option A) is the only molecular formula that satisfies the degrees of unsaturation and the spectral data provided.

**Answer: A**
