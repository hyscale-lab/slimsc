Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants, also known as formation constants, for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The options are A to D.

Wait, so I need to find the percentage of the Co(SCN)_2 complex, which I think is the dithiocyanato complex. Because dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So the complexes would be Co(SCN)^(n), where n is the number of ligands. The blue one is probably the one with two ligands, so Co(SCN)₂²+ maybe.

Stability constants, β, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The β for each complex is the formation constant for that specific complex. So, β1 is for CoSCN+ (one SCN), β2 is for Co(SCN)₂²+ (two SCNs), β3 for Co(SCN)₃³+ (three), and β4 for Co(SCN)₄^4-? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in terms of charge, Co²+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So, for Co(SCN)_n, the overall charge is 2 - n. So for n=1, charge is +1 (CoSCN+), n=2 is 0 (Co(SCN)₂), n=3 is -1 (Co(SCN)₃^-), n=4 is -2 (Co(SCN)_4^2-).

But wait, the stability constants given are β1=9 (for n=1), β2=40 (n=2), β3=63 (n=3), β4=16 (n=4). So the most stable complex is the one with n=3, β3=63. Interesting.

But the question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato, which is n=2, so Co(SCN)₂. So I need to find the fraction of Co in this form.

In such a solution, the cobalt can exist in various forms: as free Co²+ ions, or bound to 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN- ligands. The total concentration of all these species adds up to the total cobalt concentration, which is 1e-2 M.

So the approach is to calculate the distribution of Co among all possible complexes and the free ion. The distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentration of SCN-.

I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be determined using the stability constants and the ligand concentration. The fraction of each complex is given by the product of the cumulative formation constant up to that stage divided by the sum of all such products for all possible complexes.

Wait, the general formula for the fraction of a particular complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) / [ (β1 β2 ... β1) + (β1 β2 ... β2) * [SCN] + ... + (β1 β2 ... βn) * [SCN]^n + ... ]

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, each species is formed by adding SCN- step by step. So the fraction of the nth complex is (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN^-]^n divided by the sum over all m of (β1 β2 ... βm) [SCN^-]^m.

Wait, that's right. Each species Co(SCN)_m has a concentration given by [Co²+][SCN^-]^m multiplied by the product of the stability constants up to m, divided by the sum of all such terms for m=0 to 4.

Wait, more precisely, let me think.

The formation of the complexes is stepwise. The first complex is CoSCN+, formed from Co²+ and SCN- with β1=9. The second is Co(SCN)₂²+ formed by adding another SCN- to CoSCN+ with β2=40. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)₂²+ is β1 * β2 = 9*40=360.

Similarly, the third complex's formation constant is β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680. And the fourth is 9*40*63*16=221760.

Wait, but wait. So for each complex, the cumulative β is the product of β1 through βn. So for the first complex (n=1), β_total1=β1=9. For n=2, it's 9*40=360, for n=3, 360*63=22680, and for n=4, 22680*16=362880.

So the concentration of each complex is calculated as [Co²+] [SCN-]^n multiplied by the cumulative β up to n, divided by the sum of all [Co²+] [SCN]^n β_cumulative for n=0 to 4.

Wait, but wait: for n=0, it's the free Co²+ concentration, which doesn't have any SCN- attached. So the term for n=0 is just [Co²+], and the cumulative β is 1 (since it's the starting point, no complexes formed). So for the free ion, the fraction is [Co²+] multiplied by β_0 =1, divided by the sum.

So the general formula is:

Each species Co(SCN)_n has a concentration given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = [Co²+] [SCN-]^n * (β1β2...βn) / (β0 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + ... )

But wait, β0 is 1, and the denominators for each term is the same for all species, so the fractions are just the numerator divided by the sum.

So the fraction fn for each n is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total = (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n ) / sum_{m=0}^4 (β1β2...βm [SCN]^m )

But wait, because the sum includes all the terms from m=0 to m=4.

So for each n, fn is (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n ) / S, where S is the sum of (β1β2...βm [SCN]^m ) for m=0 to 4.

So β1β2...βm is the cumulative product up to m.

So let's compute each term.

Given:

[SCN-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term in the sum S.

For m=0: it's β0 [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 = 1.

m=1: β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

m=2: β1β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

m=3: 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3.

Hmm, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

(0.1)^3=0.001.

22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

m=4: β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 = 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001.

362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So the terms are:

m=0: 1

m=1: 0.9

m=2:3.6

m=3:22.68

m=4:36.288

Sum S=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = Let me calculate that.

1 +0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So S=64.468.

Now, the term for n=2 (dithiocyanato) is β1β2 [SCN]^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

So the fraction f2 is (3.6) / 64.468 = let's compute that.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557, which is about 5.557%.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options are in the 10s and 20s. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I confused the terms. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, wait, the term for m=2 is β1*β2*[SCN]^2. So β1=9, β2=40. So 9*40=360. [SCN]^2 is (0.1)^2=0.01.

360 *0.01=3.6. Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, m=3: 9*40*63=22680. [SCN]^3=0.001, 22680 *0.001=22.68.

m=4: 9*40*63*16=362880. [SCN]^4=0.0001, 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Summing all terms:

m=0: 1.

m=1:0.9 → sum now 1.9.

m=2:3.6 → sum 5.5.

m=3:22.68 → sum 28.18.

m=4:36.288 → sum 64.468.

That's correct.

So f2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557, so about 5.56%. But the options are much higher. Wait, the options are 42.3%, 25.6%, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the definition of β wrong. Oh wait! Wait, the stability constant βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So for Co(SCN)_2, the formation constant is β2=40, but for the complex to form from the previous one, not from the metal ion directly. So the formation of Co(SCN)_2²+ can be considered as CoSCN+ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)₂²+, with K=β2=40.

But wait, the overall formation constants for each step are:

Co²+ + SCN- ⇌ CoSCN+ ; β1=9.

CoSCN+ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)₂²+ ; β2=40.

Co(SCN)₂²+ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)3^- ; β3=63.

Co(SCN)3^- + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)4^2-; β4=16.

So the cumulative formation constants (overall for each complex) would be:

For n=1: K1=β1.

For n=2: K2=β1 * β2.

For n=3: K3=β1 * β2 * β3.

For n=4: K4=β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So for each complex, the overall formation constant is the product of β1 to βn.

So the calculation should be correct. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing the consideration of the charge. Or perhaps I forgot that the concentration expression includes the charge in terms of activity coefficients, but in this problem, we're assuming they're negligible and just using concentrations.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)₂²+—so that's n=2. But according to the fractions, it's about 5.56%, which is not one of the options. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1, not 0.1. Wait, no, 0.1 is 1e-1. So I think that's correct.

Wait, is there any other factor I'm missing? Oh wait! Oh wait, I think I might have mixed up the terms. The sum S is the sum of all possibilities, including [Co²+], which is the free ion. So each term in the sum is [Co²+][SCN]^m multiplied by the product of β1 to βm, then divided by whatever. Wait, no, no, the formula is correct.

Wait, but wait, the concentration of each Co(SCN)_m is [Co²+] [SCN]^m multiplied by (β1β2...βm), and the denominator is the sum of each of these for m=0 to 4.

Wait, but the sum is:

sum = [Co²+] * (β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, no, because each term is [Co²+] multiplied by [SCN]^m multiplied by the product of β1 to βm. So the sum is [Co²+] multiplied by (1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288). Because for each m, [SCN]^m is (0.1)^m, and the β product is β1*β2...βm.

So the sum is [Co²+] * (64.468).

But the actual concentration of each complex is [Co²+] [SCN]^m (β1β2...βm) divided by sum, which is [Co²+] *64.468.

So the fraction f2 is ( [Co²+] [SCN]^2 β1β2 ) / ( [Co²+] * 64.468 ), which simplifies to (β1β2 [SCN]^2 ) /64.468.

Which is (9*40*(0.1)^2 ) /64.468.

Wait, 9 *40=360. 0.1^2=0.01. So 360 *0.01=3.6. 3.6 /64.468 is approximately 0.05557 or 5.557%. But none of the options are around 5.5%. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Maybe the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)₂²+ (n=2), but perhaps the question is about the percentage of all dithiocyanato species, which might include some other form, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the stability constants. Wait, maybe the problem is using β as the formation constant for the nth complex, not the step
