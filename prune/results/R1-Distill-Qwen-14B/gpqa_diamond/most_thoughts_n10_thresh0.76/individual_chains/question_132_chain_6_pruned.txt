Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to think it through. The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

First, I need to remember what 1H NMR signals for aromatic regions look like. Aromatic protons typically show up between 6.5-8.5 ppm, depending on substitution and electron effects. Singlets mean no neighboring protons. So two singlets each integrating for 1H each (since it's a 1:1 ratio), but wait the total in the ratio is 2:1:1 for the other signals, but that's the aliphatic region. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says two signals (singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. So each peak is 1H each. That would mean each aromatic compound contributes a certain number of protons, but their signals overlap in such a way that each gives a singlet.

Wait, but for benzene rings with substituents, if the ring is para-substituted, maybe the protons are equivalent. Let me think about each structure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (which is 1,2,3,4-tetra substituted) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,3,4 would have four substituents in a row. So the structure would have methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. That would leave positions 5 and 6 empty. Wait, but wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1,2,3,4 would be adjacent, which might not be possible because that's four in a row. Wait, no, in benzene, each adjacent position is next. So 1,2,3,4 are four consecutive positions. So the structure would have methyl groups at 1,2,3,4. The remaining positions would be 5 and 6, which are opposite each other if you have 1,2,3,4.

Wait, but that's possible? Alternatively, maybe it's a naphthalene structure, but no, the formula is C10H14. Wait, each compound is C10H14. Let's check each option's molecular formula.

Wait, the molecular formula given is C10H14. Let me calculate for each compound:

Tetramethylbenzene: benzene (C6H6) plus four methyl groups (each CH3). So each is C6 + 4*(C1) = C10. Hydrogens: C6H6 has 6 H. Each methyl adds 3 H, so four methyls add 12 H. So total H is 6 +
