Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then predicting the product after a series of reactions. Let me break it down.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. So, the degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, wait, the formula is CnHmOxNp. Let me recall the formula correctly. Oh right, DoU = (2n +2 - m - x + p)/2. Wait, no, for each N, it's like each contributes a +1? Or is it handled differently? Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of hydrogen deficiency.

Wait, another way: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: each degree is a ring or a double bond. For each N, it's like contributing a hydrogen. Wait, maybe I should count each N as adding a hydrogen. So, starting with the general formula for a hydrocarbon: CnH2n+2. Each O would take away 2H (if in a hydroxyl or similar), each N takes away 1 H. So, formula is C8H9NO. 

Compute the hydrogen deficit: For C8H16 (since 2n+2 = 18 when n=8, wait no, 8 carbons would be 2*8 +2=18 H for a completely saturated). So, in our case, H is 9. So the deficit is 18 -9 =9. Then subtract for O and N: O is one, so subtract 2 H (since each O typically adds a -OH which is -1 H compared to an alkane?), wait maybe I should re-examine. The formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, X is halogens, which aren't present here. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Wait, the formula is (2*8 +2 - 9 - 0 +1)/2. So that's (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Five could be from a ring and several double bonds, or other combinations.

Looking at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows:
9.72 (t, 1H) → a triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's probably an aldehyde proton, since aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, but wait, an aldehyde is usually a singlet because there's only one proton and adjacent carbons might not have protons. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Maybe an acidic proton, like an -OH, but that's usually broad. Wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde. But why a triplet? Or perhaps it's an alpha proton to an aldehyde, like in a conjugated system. Wait, maybe it's adjacent to a double bond.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The d, 2H for each suggests two doublets that are part of a para-substituted benzene. So, maybe two phenyl groups? Or one phenyl group with substituents.

Next, 6.27 (bs, 2H) → broad singlet, 2 protons. That sounds like an -OH group, but wait, in the aromatic region, but could also be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen or something.

Then, 3.66 (d, 2H) → a doublet around 3.66 ppm. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. So perhaps a methylene group next to an oxygen, like a CH2O.

Putting this together: We have an aldehyde (9.72 ppm), two aromatic rings (the two doublets in the 6.98 and 6.51 regions), a broad singlet (maybe an -OH or another proton), and a CH2 group next to oxygen.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, that's 8 carbons. Let's see: If there are two phenyl groups (each has 6 carbons, but wait, that's 12, which is way higher. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So perhaps it's a smaller structure. Maybe the compound has a central chain with substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's a diphenyl compound but with smaller substituents. Alternatively, maybe the main structure is something like a butenone or similar.

Let me try to think of the structure. The NMR has an aldehyde proton, so perhaps an aldehyde group. Then two aromatic regions, which might be two substituents. The 3.66 ppm could be a CH2 next to, say, an oxygen, like OCH2. 

Wait, another angle: The reactions given are NaNO2 + HCl (which usually does nitrous acid, maybe for diazotization), then H2O, then aqueous KOH with heat. That sounds like a typical procedure for a hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, perhaps leading to a phenol or a ring-substituted product.

Wait, but wait. The initial compound is C8H9NO. Let me count the atoms. Nitrogen and oxygen are present. So, maybe the structure has an aromatic ring, a substituent with an aldehyde, and some oxygen-containing groups.

Wait, let me try to piece together the structure. Suppose the molecule is something like benzaldehyde derivative. Let's see.

The aldehyde is at 9.72 ppm. Then, the aromatic protons: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted ring. So maybe two substituents on a benzene ring. Wait, but wait, the integration is 2H each, so perhaps two doublets which are each 2H, meaning for each, it's a pair of H in a para-substituted ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diphenyl compound. For example, each phenyl group is attached to the same carbon, but that might be less likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with substituents.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule has a central chain with substituents. For example, a four-carbon chain (butyl) with substituents. Let me think about the NMR.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, maybe as in an OCH2 group. So perhaps the structure has something like OCH2CH2...? Or maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl.

Wait, but considering the aldehyde at 9.7 ppm, perhaps the structure has a conjugated system. So the aldehyde is at one end, and there's a double bond nearby.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the reagents. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's typically used for diazotization of an aromatic amine (like aniline), forming a diazonium salt. Then, when treated with water (maybe as a hydrolysis step), and then aqueous KOH with heat, which could be a ring substitution or some elimination.

Wait, but wait. The starting compound has an -NO group in the formula. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So that's one N and one O. So, the structure must have an amine group
