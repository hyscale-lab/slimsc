Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to think through it step by step. Let me see what the question says. 

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO, and there's NMR data provided. Then it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to figure out the final product from the options given.

First, I'll start by looking at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR shows:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H
- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H
- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H
- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so likely an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, so maybe that's it.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are each doublets. Those are in the aromatic region. The doublets could mean that each set of protons is next to another set that's split the signal. So maybe two aromatic rings, each with a pair of protons in a para-substituted position. Like two phenyl groups, each with substituents in the para position.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Let me plug in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which could be a ring and some double bonds or triple bonds. 

Looking at the NMR: the 9.72 ppm could be an aldehyde. Then, the aromatic protons: two doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons on aromatic rings. Also, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad usually means exchange with something, maybe -OH protons, but wait, those would be a broad peak, but here it's two protons. Hmm, but if it's a singlet, maybe it's not an -OH, or maybe it's in a different environment.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's in the range of a CH2 group next to something deshielded. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen? Like an OCH2 group or something like that.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure. Maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde with substituents. Let me think: the aldehyde is at the end, and there's some substituents on the benzene rings.

Wait, another thought: the 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets. If each is a pair of equivalent protons, perhaps each is part of a para-substituted benzene ring. So maybe each benzene ring has another substituent in para position, like an O
