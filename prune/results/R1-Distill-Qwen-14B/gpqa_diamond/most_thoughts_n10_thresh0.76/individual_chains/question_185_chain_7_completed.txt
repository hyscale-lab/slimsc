Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let's see. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So the dot product would be σ·n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

Wait, I remember that the eigenvalues of a spin operator like σ·n should relate to the spin states. For a spin-½ particle, the eigenvalues are ±ℏ/2 when you have σ·n multiplied by something. Or wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices themselves, when multiplied by a unit vector direction, form an observable. The eigenvalues of σ·n would be ±1, I think. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and the dot product with a unit vector doesn't change the magnitude of the eigenvalues, just the direction. Or does it?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The operator σ·n is a combination of the Pauli matrices. The trace of σ·n would be zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. And the square of σ·n is (σ·n)^2. Let me compute that. Expanding (σ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), since σ_x² = I, and similarly for σ_y and σ_z. So the square would be n_x² I + n_y² I + n_z² I + cross terms. But wait, the cross terms involve σ_i σ_j where i≠j, which are the sum of σ_i σ_j and σ_j σ_i, which I think are equal to 2i ε_ijk σ_k, but wait, when you square σ·n, the cross terms are 2 (n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z). And I recall that σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. So when i≠j, σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k. So, when we expand (σ·n)^2, the cross terms have i factors. But when we sum all the terms, maybe it simplifies.

Wait, let's compute (σ·n)^2. So n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. Each σ_i^2 is I, so the sum of squares is 3I? No, wait each term is n_i² σ_i² = n_i² I. So summing over i, it's (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I = I. And the cross terms are 2(n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + ...) as above. But since σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, and similarly for others, the cross terms become 2i (n_x n_y σ_z + n_x n_z (-σ_y) + n_y n_z σ_x). Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, another approach: the operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1, because if you look at the spin in the direction of n, the eigenstates would have spin up and down, so eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the Hamiltonian H is ε multiplied by that operator. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by ±1, giving ±ε. So the eigenvalues are ε and -ε. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B says ±ε. Option C says ±(ε ℏ/2), which would be the case if the Pauli matrices were multiplied by something else. Wait, but the Pauli matrices don't have a factor of ℏ in them. Because when you have spin operators, S = (ℏ/2) σ. So for example, S·n has eigenvalues ±ℏ/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of σ, not S. So without the ℏ/2 factor, the eigenvalues would be ±1 times ε, so ±ε.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the Pauli matrices are presented without the ℏ/2 factor, depending on the context. So if the Hamiltonian is ε σ·n, then the eigenvalues are ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ·n, which are ±1. So eigenvalues are ±ε. Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices and \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector. The eigenvalues of the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are known to be \( \pm 1 \), as this operator corresponds to the spin in the direction of \( \vec{n} \). Since the Hamiltonian is proportional to \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) with a proportionality constant \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as explained above.
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because the Pauli matrices \( \vec{\sigma} \) do not inherently include a factor of \( \hbar/2 \); this factor arises in the spin operator \( \vec{S} = (\hbar/2) \vec{\sigma} \).
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not involve the constant \( \varepsilon \), which is part of the Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( \pm \varepsilon \), making **Option B** the correct choice.

Answer: B
