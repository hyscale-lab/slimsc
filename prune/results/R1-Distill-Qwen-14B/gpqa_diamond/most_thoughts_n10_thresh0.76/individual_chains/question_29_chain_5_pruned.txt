Okay, so I've got this question about genetics and plant breeding. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound and it's got five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for a mutation that would eliminate the compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the DNA sequence. The question is asking which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think the idea is that the gene produces a protein, and if a mutation disrupts the gene's function, the compound won't be made, which would be good.

The wild-type sequence is given, and each mutant has some changes. Let me look at each mutant's changes.

First, the wild-type gene sequence starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild-type, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCT. In mutant 1, I see TTCTCGCT becomes TCTACGCT. Wait, let me count the nucleotides. Let me line them up:

Wild-type: ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG T T C T ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, maybe it's easier to look at the exact positions. The first part of the wild-type is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the first part:

Wild-type has TTTCTCGCT. So the first six nucleotides after ATG are TTT CTC GCT.

In Mutant1, it's TTCTACGCT. Wait, maybe it's better to write the sequences:

Wild-type exon 1 starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T GGT ACT...

Wait, perhaps comparing:

Wild-type: ...TTTCTCGCT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCT...

Wait no, let me look at the exact changes. The first part of the wild-type is TTTCTCGCT. So that's positions 4-10 maybe.

In Mutant1, the same region is TTCTACGCT. So perhaps a substitution occurred here. So the change is that instead
