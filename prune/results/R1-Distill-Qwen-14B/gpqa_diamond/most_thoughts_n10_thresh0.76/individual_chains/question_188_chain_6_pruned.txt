Okay, so I'm trying to solve this crystallography problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the unit cell parameters. 

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, rhombohedral means all the edges are of equal length, a=b=c, and all the angles are the same, alpha=beta=gamma. So in this case, each angle is 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Hmm, wait, interatomic distance—does that refer to the lattice parameter 'a'? I think so. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be 'a', so yeah, a=10 Angstroms here.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / (sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ))) ). Or wait, wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Or perhaps it's the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. Let me think. Oh, right, the formula is d = (a)/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) ))).

Wait a second, wait. Because in a cubic system, the angles are all 90 degrees, and the formula simplifies. But in this case, the angles are 30 degrees. So I can't ignore the cosine terms.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1. Let me plug in the values. First, compute the denominator inside the square root. The angles are alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so cos of 30 degrees is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute each term step by step.

First, compute h² + k² + l². That's 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Next, the terms involving products of h, k, l, and cosines. So:

- 2hk cos gamma: h=1, k=1, gamma=30°, so 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2)= 2*(sqrt(3)/2)= sqrt(3) ≈1.732.

Same for 2hl cos beta and 2kl cos alpha. Since all angles are 30°, each of these terms is sqrt(3) as well.

So the total for these terms is 3 * sqrt(3) ≈3 *1.732≈5.196.

Wait, so the denominator's square root part is sqrt( 3 - 5.196 ). Wait, 3 -5.196 is negative? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I messed up the signs.

Wait, the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha ). So the denominator is 3 - 5.196 ≈ -2.196. But the square root of a negative number is impossible. That can't be right. Did I get the formula wrong?

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think again. Oh, wait, another approach: for the interplanar distance, the formula is 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/(a² (1/2)) ). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ), but wait no, that doesn't seem right either. Wait, maybe I should refer back to the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal.

Wait, perhaps the general formula for d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the vector in the reciprocal lattice. So the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by (h, k, l) in reciprocal space, and the magnitude is sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hk cos β + hk cos gamma) )? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, in a general rhombohedral system (which is a special case of a hexagonal crystal?), wait no, rhombohedral is a type of cubic system with all a, b, c equal but angles not 90 degrees.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar spacing for a plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral lattice is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. But when I plug the numbers, I get a negative under the square root, which is a problem.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ?

Wait, that would make more sense, because if the angles are acute, the cosines are positive, so the denominator would be larger, making d smaller.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting memories here. Let me try to derive it.

In a crystal lattice, the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) can be found using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. For a general crystal system, the formula is:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)/(a^2)

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) / ( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 h k cos α + 2 h l cos β + 2 k l cos γ ) ) ]^(-1/2) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I
