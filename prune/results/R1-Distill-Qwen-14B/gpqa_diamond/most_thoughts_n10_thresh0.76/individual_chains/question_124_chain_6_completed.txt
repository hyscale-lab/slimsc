Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

So, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls instead.

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since these particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their gamma is high. The key here must be how much time they have before they decay and whether they reach the detector's walls within that time.

Wait, the problem says that one third reach the walls when gamma is 20. Now, we need to find the gamma when two-thirds reach the walls. So, I think the number of particles that reach the walls depends on their lifetime as perceived in the lab frame, right? Because if the lifetime is longer, more particles will have time to travel the 30 meters before decaying.

So, the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is tau. The observed lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times tau. The particles need to travel a distance equal to the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters, before decaying.

The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. Since they're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, but perhaps we can approximate their speed as c? Wait, ultra-relativistic implies v is very close to c, so v ≈ c. So, time t = 30 m / (c). Let's compute that.

The speed of light c is about 3e8 meters per second. So t = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. Or 10^-7 seconds.

Wait, but that's the time it takes to reach the wall. The particle's lifetime must be at least this time for a significant fraction to reach the wall.

So the proper lifetime tau must be such that a fraction of the particles decay before t, and a fraction survive. The number that survive is given by the exponential decay law: N = N0 * exp(-t / tau). So the fraction that reach the wall is exp(-t / tau).

But in the given problem, when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So let me write that down.

At gamma1 = 20, fraction f1 = 1/3 = exp(-t / (gamma1 * tau)).

Because the observed lifetime is gamma * tau, so tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper.

Wait, actually, the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. So the decay time in lab frame is gamma*tau, so the decay probability is given by exp(-t / (gamma * tau)).

So, when gamma is 20, 1/3 of the particles reach the wall. So,

1/3 = exp( - t / (gamma1 * tau) )

Similarly, when gamma is gamma2, the desired fraction is 2/3, so:

2/3 = exp( - t / (gamma2 * tau) )

I can take the natural logs of both sides for both equations to solve for the ratio.

Taking logs:

ln(1/3) = -t/(gamma1 * tau)
ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma2 * tau)

Wait, but wait a second: the formula is N = N0 exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no. Wait, the mean lifetime is gamma * tau, so the decay rate is lambda = 1/(gamma tau). So the fraction surviving is exp( -lambda * t ) = exp( -t/(gamma tau) ).

So yes, the equations I wrote are correct.

So:

ln(1/3) = - t/(gamma1 tau)
ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma2 tau)

Let me write them as:

t/(gamma1 tau) = - ln(1/3)
t/(gamma2 tau) = - ln(2/3)

Dividing the two equations:

(t/(gamma1 tau)) / (t/(gamma2 tau)) ) = [ -ln(1/3) ] / [ -ln(2/3) ]

Simplify:

(gamma2 / gamma1) = [ ln(3) ] / [ ln(3/2) ]

Because ln(1/3) is -ln3, so when you take the ratio, the negatives cancel.

So,

gamma2 = gamma1 * [ ln(3) / ln(3/2) ]

Compute that value.

Let's compute the numerical value.

ln(3) is approximately 1.0986.

ln(3/2) is ln(1.5) which is approximately 0.4055.

So,

gamma2 ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 54.

Wait, so the new gamma is approximately 54.18, so the answer should be option A) 54.

Let me double-check the steps.

We know that the fraction surviving is f = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Given that when gamma is 20, f is 1/3.

When gamma is larger, the denominator increases, so the exponent becomes smaller, so exp(-small) is larger. So f increases as gamma increases, which makes sense. So when gamma increases, more particles survive to reach the wall.

So the gamma we need is higher than 20, which our calculation shows as 54, which is option A.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A) 54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' lifetime and their ability to travel the detector's radius. The fraction of particles that reach the walls is governed by the exponential decay law:

\[
f = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where \( t \) is the time it takes for a particle to travel the detector's radius, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Time to travel the detector's radius
The detector's radius is \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \), and the particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, approximated as \( v \approx c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). The time to travel the radius is:

\[
t = \frac{R}{c} = \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating fractions and Lorentz factors
When \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), one-third of the particles reach the walls, so:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}\right).
\]

When \( \gamma_2 \) is the desired Lorentz factor for two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls, we have:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both equations:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}, \quad \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}.
\]

Dividing these equations to eliminate \( t \) and \( \tau \):

\[
\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1} = \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(3/2)}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the ratio
Using approximate values for the logarithms:

\[
\ln(3) \approx 1.0986, \quad \ln(3/2) \approx 0.4055,
\]

\[
\frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(3/2)} \approx \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 2.709.
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2.709 = 20 \cdot 2.709 \approx 54.18.
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately \( \gamma_2 \approx 54 \). Comparing this to the options, the closest match is:

**A) 54.**
