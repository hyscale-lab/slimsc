Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll see what I can remember.

So the setup is: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both bigger than R. Also, there's an angle θ between l and s. 

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges. Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor distribute themselves on the surface. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, but now there's a charge inside the cavity, that should influence the charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface must induce an opposite charge, right? Because the charge +q inside the cavity would repel electrons to the inner surface, leaving a +q charge there. But wait, no—wait, the conductor is neutral. So if +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q, because the conductor was initially neutral. Wait, no, wait again. No, the conductor is uncharged, so the charges induced would be such that the total charge is zero. So the inner surface would have a charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it out. Because the total conductor charge is zero, so inner -q and outer +q.

But wait, the conductor is spherical. So the inner surface is a sphere with radius r_cavity? Or wait, the conductor is the outer sphere with radius R, but the cavity is inside, so the inner surface is the inner cavity wall. But the cavity isn't centered at the conductor's center because s is the distance between the centers. Oh right, the cavity is shifted by s. So the setup is a bit more complicated.

Wait, but when
