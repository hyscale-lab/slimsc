Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to these kinds of reactions. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize this structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (OHCH2-), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a substituent with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to the cyclohexane at position C2. So that would be an isopropenyl group, right? So the structure is cyclohexanone with substituents at 3 and 5 positions.

The first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, so I think this is a deprotonation reaction. But wait, benzyl bromide is an alkyl halide, so maybe it's an alkylation. Where would the deprotonation happen? The starting material has a hydroxymethyl group. So the -OH is on the cyclohexane, and the adjacent CH2 group. Sodium hydride would deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form an alkoxide. Then, benzyl bromide would alkylate that oxygen.

So, the -O- from the hydroxymethyl would attack the benzyl bromide (which is an SN2 reaction, I think), replacing the bromide. So the product after this step would have a benzyl group attached to the oxygen of the hydroxymethyl, making it a benzyl ether. So the structure becomes 3-(benzyloxy)methyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's product 1.

Next, product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic HCl, forming product 2. Wait, p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction. That reaction is used to reduce ketones to alkanes by first forming a hydrazones and then eliminating the carbonyl group. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So first, the ketone (cyclohexanone) would react with the hydrazide to form a hydrazone.

Wait, but the conditions are HCl catalytic. So, perhaps it's acid-catalyzed formation of the hydrazone. So step 1 is forming the hydrazone. Then step 2 is the elimination under strong basic conditions, but wait, the problem says it's treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in presence of catalytic HCl. So, I think the ketone is converted into a hydrazone.

Wait, but the Wolff-Kishner reaction generally requires heating under strong basic conditions, like with ammonia and a base. Here, maybe it's just the formation of the hydrazone, not the elimination yet. So product 2 would be the corresponding hydrazone. Let me think: the ketone becomes a hydrazone. So the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes C=N-NH-Ts (since Ts is p-toluenesulfonyl). So the cyclohexanone becomes a cyclohexyl hydrazone.

Wait, but the question says product 2 is formed. So maybe the reaction is the formation of the hydrazone. So product 2 is the hydrazone. So we have 3-(benzyloxy)methyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)-cyclohexylidene hydrazide with p-toluenesulfony
