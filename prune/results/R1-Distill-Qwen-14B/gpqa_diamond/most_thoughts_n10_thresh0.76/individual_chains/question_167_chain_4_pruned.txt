Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2)). 

The relative entropy measure, del_b, is defined as the difference between the trace of rho ln rho and the trace of tau ln tau, where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

The specific values given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

Hmm, okay. So I'm a bit rusty on non-Gaussian states and their measures, but let's start by recalling what a Gaussian state is. Gaussian states include coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are those that cannot be described by Gaussian statistics, like certain superpositions of coherent states, such as the Schrödinger cat state.

The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, also known as the quantum relative entropy, measures how non-Gaussian a state is by comparing it to the closest Gaussian state. So, if the state is Gaussian, this measure should be zero, right?

Wait, the options include D) 0. So when would this happen? If the state itself is Gaussian. So looking at the state given, perhaps under certain conditions phi and alpha, the state becomes Gaussian. Because the problem gives specific phi and alpha, maybe the state ends up being a Gaussian state, leading to zero non-Gaussianity.

Let me think about the state |psi>. It's a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), respectively. The normalization factor N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

Wait, but when does this state become Gaussian? Well, a Gaussian state's density matrix is Gaussian, so if the state |psi> is a Gaussian state, then its density matrix rho would be Gaussian, making del_b zero because rho and tau would be the same.

But wait, the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are not unless the coefficients are zero or one. So unless the state is actually a coherent state itself, it might not be Gaussian.

Wait, let's compute the state for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

First, compute cos(phi) and sin(phi). Phi is -pi/4, so cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.7071.

So the state becomes:

|psi> = [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> + (-sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / N.

Wait, but let's compute N. The normalization factor N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Compute sin(2phi): phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1.

Then, exp(-2 alpha^2) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈0.6065.

So the term inside N is 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935.

So N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So the state is:

|psi> = [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.627.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let's think about the state more carefully. For phi = -pi/4, the coefficients are cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2 and sin(phi)= -sqrt(2)/2. So the state is [ |0.5> - | -0.5> ] multiplied by sqrt(2)/2, then divided by N.

Wait, but wait a second. The state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are coherent states with opposite phases. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator a, and they are displaced vacuum states. So |alpha> and |-alpha> are different coherent states.

But wait, when you have a superposition of two coherent states, is that state Gaussian? Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions (with equal weights) can form non-Gaussian states, like the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states.

Wait, but in some cases, such superpositions might actually be Gaussian. Wait, perhaps when the superposition has certain properties.

Wait, perhaps the state in this case reduces to a single coherent state. Because when I look at this, maybe the state can be rewritten. Let me think.

Wait, let me compute the state in detail. The state is [ |alpha> cos(phi) + | -alpha> sin(phi) ] / N.

Since alpha is 0.5, and phi is -pi/4. So substituting phi as -pi/4, cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)= -sqrt(2)/2.

So the state becomes (sqrt(2)/2)(|0.5> - | -0.5> ) / N.

Now, wait, is there a way this can be rewritten as a single coherent state? Let me see.

Another approach: perhaps the state can be expressed as a single coherent state if it's symmetrized correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a squeezed state or another Gaussian state.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the density matrix. The state is a pure state, so rho = |psi><psi|.

The relative entropy del_b is calculated between rho and tau, which is a Gaussian state. If rho is Gaussian, then del_b would be zero, implying that the non-Gaussianity is zero.

So the question is, is the given state a Gaussian state for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5?

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a squeezed vacuum state or a coherent state, which are Gaussian.

Wait, let's compute N again. N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2).

With phi=-pi/4, sin(2 phi)= sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N^2= 1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So the state is |psi> = [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.627.

Wait, another approach: perhaps this state can be expressed as a single coherent state. Let me see.

Wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. So let me think about whether the superposition can be written as another coherent state. Let me try to compute the coefficients.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to write this as |beta>, where beta is some complex number.

Wait, another approach: the state |psi> is:

( |alpha> cos(phi) + |-alpha> sin(phi) ) / N.

Let me factor out |alpha>:

= |alpha> [ cos(phi) + sin(phi) e^{-2i alpha} ] / N.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the properties of coherent states. Coherent states are over-complete, so perhaps a super
