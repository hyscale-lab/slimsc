Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's a very tiny distance.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle. The formula for the mean decay distance is c multiplied by the lifetime (tau) multiplied by the velocity (beta) of the particle. So, mean distance L = c * beta * tau.

But how do I find tau? Oh, right! The lifetime tau is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a particle, the natural linewidth is Γ, so ΔE is approximately Γ, and Δt is the lifetime tau. So, Γ * tau ≈ ħ. Therefore, tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I should double-check the exact relation. I think the formula is tau = ħ / Γ. Or maybe it's tau = ħ_bar / (Γ/2π) )? Wait, the natural linewidth is Γ = delta E, and the uncertainty in energy is delta E = ħ / tau. So, solving for tau gives tau = ħ / (delta E). But delta E in this case is the width Γ. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, sometimes the width is given as the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. Hmm, I think that's correct.

But wait, units! What are the units here? Let me think. Gamma is in MeV, which is an energy unit. The Planck constant ħ is in J·s, but to convert it into units that work here, perhaps I should use it in GeV·seconds or similar.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me see. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Oh right, because ħ ≈ 6.626e
