Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens—no, wait, that's plants. Oh right, the photosphere is where the star emits most of its light. And in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, the conditions are such that we can apply certain physical laws.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I remember that the excitation of atoms in stars relates to their temperature. Probably something to do with the Boltzmann distribution.

Boltzmann distribution... yeah, it's about the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature.

So in this case, the population ratio between the excited state and the ground state (or some lower state) would be given by:

n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k T) )

But wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think that for star_1, the population of the specific excited energy level is twice that of star_2. Let's denote the populations as n1 and n2 for star_1 and star_2 respectively.

So n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, the ratio n1/n2 would be 2. Or wait, perhaps I need to think about how the excitation depends on each star's temperature. Let's model this.

For each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to those in the lower state is:

n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1, n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * n_lower,1

Similarly, for star_2, n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * n_lower,2

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice
