Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then predicting the product after a series of reactions. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, let me jot down what I know. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, calculating the degree of unsaturation might help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I think the formula is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let's plug in the numbers. C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So, DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=(10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That can be from rings and double bonds. Each double bond or ring is one DoU, and each triple bond is two, etc.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR is given as:

9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

So let me think about each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two other protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group or something.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). This looks like two sets of doublets, each integrating for two protons. That suggests perhaps two para-substituted aromatic rings. The downfield shift (6.98) could be a substituent that is electron-withdrawing, while 6.51 is maybe a bit less deshielded, perhaps an ortho or meta substituent. Alternatively, maybe these are parts of a conjugated system.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad singlet might indicate an -OH proton, but wait, that's usually a broad peak, but an -OH in a phenol would be a singlet if not split. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or some other protons near an electronegative group. Hmm, not sure yet.

The 3.66 (d, 2H) is a doublet integrating for 2H. This could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's part of an ether or an alkoxy group. Or perhaps a methylene next to a carbonyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the molecule has an aromatic ring, an aldehyde group, and some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about the possible structure. Since the NMR shows aromatic protons, it's likely that the compound has a benzene ring. Let me count the carbons: if there's a benzene ring (6 carbons), then the remaining two carbons are in the substituents.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Benzene (6 C) plus two more carbons. So perhaps a benzene ring with substituents totaling 2 carbons. But wait, the substituents could be more if the ring is part of a larger structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a phenyl group attached to another structure. Let me think about the aldehyde. An aldehyde would take up one of the functional groups. So the molecule could be something like a benzaldehyde derivative, perhaps with some substituents.

Wait, the NMR shows an aldehyde (9.72, t), so maybe the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with some substituents.

Looking at the substituents on the benzene ring. The peaks at 6.98 and 6.51 as doublets of 2H each. If the ring has two substituents in para positions, that would give two doublets. For example, if there are two substituents on the ring that are para to each other, each with two protons. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent would have two protons as doublets if they're adjacent to substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, each substituent being a group that has two protons. Or maybe it's a vinyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings. But with C8H9NO, that might not add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a single benzene ring with substituents that contribute to more than two carbons.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a benzene ring and another group attached, like a carbonyl and an aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about the other peaks. The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H, perhaps a CH2-O group, like a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. So maybe there's an OCH2 group.

The 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) is a bit tricky. Could it be a pair of protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a diol or something else? Or maybe it's part of an enol structure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the reagents used. The reaction sequence is:

1. NaNO2 + HCl

2. H2O

3. aq. KOH, Heat

These reagents are familiar. Let's think about what each step does.

Step 1: NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization. That's usually done with aromatic amines, like aniline derivatives
