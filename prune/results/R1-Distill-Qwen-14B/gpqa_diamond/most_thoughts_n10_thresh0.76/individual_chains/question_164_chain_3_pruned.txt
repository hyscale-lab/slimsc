Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2. 

Wait, the problem gives me the periods of the eclipses. Both systems have their periods: system_1 is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year. Oh wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period of the binary system. Right, Kepler's laws must come into play here.

Then there's data about radial velocity (RV) variations. System_1 has amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10. I think the RV method is used to determine the masses of the stars. Oh right, in a spectroscopic binary, the velocity of each star relates to their masses. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass and orbits with a smaller radius.

So the formula I remember is that the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to their mass. So if star A has mass M_A and velocity v_A, and star B has M_B and v_B, then M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A. Because the center of mass requires M_A * v_A = M_B * v_B, so their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

So let me compute the mass ratio for each system.

For system_1: the velocities are 10 and 5. So the mass ratio M1A/M1B is 5/10 = 0.5. So M1A is half of M1B. So the total mass of system_1 is M1A + M1B = 0.5 M1B + M1B = 1.5 M1B. Or wait, maybe it's better to express the mass ratio as M1A/M1B = v1B / v1A. So M1A is the mass of the star with velocity 5, and M1B is the star with velocity 10.

So M1A/M1B = 10 /5 = 2? Wait wait, no. Wait, the mass is inversely proportional to velocity. So higher velocity star is less massive. So if star A has velocity
