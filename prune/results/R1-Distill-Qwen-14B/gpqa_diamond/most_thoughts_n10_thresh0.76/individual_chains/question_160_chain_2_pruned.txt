Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about diffraction patterns created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, okay, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark spots called the diffraction pattern. This pattern depends on the shape and size of the aperture.

The problem says the aperture is a N-sided polygon, and all apothems are the same length a. Apothems are the distance from the center to the midpoint of each side, right? So if all apothems are equal, the polygon is regular. But wait, the question is considering N as infinitely large. Oh, right, so as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Because a polygon with infinite sides is a smooth circle. So, the aperture in this case effectively becomes a circular aperture.

Wait, but the problem says it's a polygon, but when N is very large, it's almost a circle. So the diffraction pattern should be similar to that of a circular aperture. Oh, right, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is different from that of a slit or a rectangular aperture. The central maximum is a bright spot, and around it are concentric rings of light and dark, which are the minima and maxima.

So the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. Far field implies that the Fraunhofer diffraction condition applies. Fraunhofer diffraction occurs when the screen is at a large distance from the aperture, so the angles are small. The approximation tan(theta) â‰ˆ theta is valid here, which is given in the problem.

In the case of a circular aperture, the minima occur at specific angles. I remember that the first minimum (the first dark ring) in the diffraction pattern occurs at an angle given by the formula sin(theta) = (1.22) * (lambda)/(d), where d is the diameter of the aperture. Wait, but wait, let me think again. No, wait, for a circular aperture, the minima occur where the Bessel functions of the first kind have their zeros. The first minimum is at the first zero of the Bessel function J1, which is at approximately 1.22018 radians. 

Wait, let's clarify. The general formula for the m-th minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by sin(theta) = (x_m * lambda)/(pi * a), where a is the radius of the aperture, and x_m is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum is the first zero, so x_1 is about 3.8317, but wait no, no. Wait another thing. Wait, I'm getting confused with the exact formula.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the angular position of the m-th minimum in a circular aperture is given by sin(theta_m) = (lambda) * (x_m) / (2a), where x_m is the m-th root of the derivative of the Bessel function J0. Or wait, wait. I think I'm mixing up the slit and the circular aperture.

Wait, no. For a single slit of width 'd', the minima are at
