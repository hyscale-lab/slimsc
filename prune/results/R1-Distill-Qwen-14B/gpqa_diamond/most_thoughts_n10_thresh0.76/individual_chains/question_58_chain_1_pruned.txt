Okay, so I have this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory doesn't require regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. You introduce a cutoff or some other method to make the math finite, and then you take the cutoff to infinity carefully. It's often needed because without it, the calculations blow up, and the theory isn't predictive.

So which theories need regularization? Well, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I remember that QED has these issues with divergences, especially in loop diagrams. So they must use regularization techniques. Same with Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory, and I think it's non-abelian, so maybe the divergences are more complicated, but they still require regularization.

Wait, but wait. Superstring theory... isn't that a theory that doesn't have the same problems? Oh right, because strings have higher spin or something? Or maybe because the theory is background-dependent and doesn't require the same renormalization steps? Or wait, do string theories have to deal with high-energy issues? I'm a bit confused here. Or maybe string theory naturally avoids some divergences because it's a different framework. Because in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings, not point particles, so maybe the perturbative expansions don't produce the same divergences. Or do they? I'm not so sure. I think string theories might require some form of regularization, especially when dealing with loop corrections, but perhaps not in the same way as QED or QCD.

Wait, what about Classical Electrodynamics? That's not a quantum theory. So does it require regularization? Well, regularization is a quantum field theory tool. In classical theories, you don't have the same issues with divergences because you don't have the same calculations with integrals that go to infinity. So classical theories don't need regularization. For example, in classical electromagnetism, you can have point charges with infinite charge density, but that's a different problem. But in
