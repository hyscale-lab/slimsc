Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of sigma_z. So sigma_z is the Pauli z matrix, right?

The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average outcome if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by the operator acting on the state. So mathematically, it's ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

But wait, since the operator is a sum of two terms, I can probably compute the expectation value for each part separately and then add them. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩.

Let me write down the state ψ. The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are orthonormal and eigenstates of σz, this should make things easier.

For σz, since |↑⟩ is an eigenstate with eigenvalue +1 and |↓⟩ with -1, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is just the probability of measuring +1 times +1 plus the probability of -1 times -1.

The coefficient of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient of |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Okay, that's straightforward.

Now for σx. Oh, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But how do I compute ⟨σx⟩ here?

Wait, another approach: since σx is Hermitian, and the expectation value is given by ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, for any operator, I can compute it using the components. Let's write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The Pauli matrices are:
σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So to compute ⟨σx⟩, let's compute ψ† σx ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column
