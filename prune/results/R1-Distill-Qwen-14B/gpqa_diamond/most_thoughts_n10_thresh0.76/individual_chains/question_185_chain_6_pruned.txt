Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator H. The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Here, n is a unit vector, ε is an energy constant, and σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. The options are multiple choice, so I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, all 2x2 matrices. When you take the dot product of σ with a unit vector n, you get a combination of these matrices. So σ · n would be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz.

But wait, the actual form of the Hamiltonian here is ε times that dot product. So H is ε (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz).

I think the eigenvalues of a spin operator like this can be determined by looking at the properties of the Pauli matrices. I recall that each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, no, that's when each is considered separately. When they're multiplied by coefficients, I think the eigenvalues scale accordingly.

Wait, another approach: The operator σ · n is a vector in the Bloch sphere direction. So the eigenvalues of σ · n would be the eigenvalues when you project the spin-1/2 system in that direction.

Spin-1/2 systems have spin matrices with eigenvalues ± ħ/2 when multiplied by the Pauli matrices, right? Oh wait, wait. Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves, when multiplied by ħ/2, become the spin matrices. So σ · n would be 2 times the spin component in the n direction. Because s = (ħ/2) σ, so σ · n = 2 s · n / ħ? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about it more carefully. The spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ. So S · n would be (ħ/2) (σ · n). So the Hamiltonian H is given as ε σ · n. So H = ε σ · n = (2ε / ħ) (S · n). 

But wait, what's the eigenvalue of S · n? The eigenvalues of S ·
