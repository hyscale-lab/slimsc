Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, I remember that annihilation involves particles and their antiparticles. The question says p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A⁻. Wait, protons annihilate with antiprotons and produce these particles A plus and A minus. Interesting.

The given mass of A is mA c² = 300 MeV. So, each A particle has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. The antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy, so maybe we can approximate it as non-relativistic? Or wait, no, the problem states it's "slowly moving", so perhaps we should treat it as having low velocity, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the question is about finding the velocity of particle A. So, I need to apply conservation laws. Since it's an annihilation process, I suppose both energy and momentum are conserved.

Let me think about the initial and final states. The initial state is a proton and an antiproton. The proton has rest mass m_p, and the antiproton has the same rest mass m_p. But since it's moving slowly, maybe it's easier to consider the initial momentum as just the antiproton's momentum, because the proton is presumably at rest? Or wait, no, the setup says the antiproton is moving, but the proton could be at rest. Or are both moving towards each other? Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Alternatively, maybe both are at rest? No, because they're colliding.

Wait, but the initial momentum: since the antiproton is moving, and the proton is at rest (assuming), then the initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton.

After the annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-. But perhaps they move together in some symmetric way because of conservation laws. Wait, but the problem is asking for the velocity of particle A, which suggests that all A particles have the same velocity. So maybe the two A+ and two A- are moving together in some way, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps in the center of momentum frame, all the A particles are moving symmetrically.

Wait, but let's think in the lab frame where the proton is at rest
