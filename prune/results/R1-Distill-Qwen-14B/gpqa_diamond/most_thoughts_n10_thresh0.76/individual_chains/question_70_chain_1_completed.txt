Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives a series of reactions and some properties of the compounds involved. The question is about determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, molecular symmetry groups... I think those are related to point groups in molecular symmetry. Common ones include things like D4h, C2v, etc.

Let me try to parse the information given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A + 8B → C. Since B is a gas, maybe it's something like Cl2 or another diatomic gas. 8 equivalents suggests that in the product, each molecule of A is combining with 8 B molecules.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So C + 2D → E.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is HCl and G is H2SO3 or something else. Or wait, another possibility: A is maybe an element like sulfur, which when reacted with water gives H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and H2S (but that's a gas, maybe not). Alternatively, maybe A is something else. Let's see.

Fourth point: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H. Solvents include things like H2O, ethanol, etc. But since B is a gas, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else. Let me think about possible reactions.

Wait, let me think about the reactions one by one. Let's try assigning possible substances.

Reaction 1: A + 8B → C. If B is Cl2 (a gas), and 8 equivalents mean each A takes 8 Cl. So A could be something like S (sulfur), which when reacted with Cl2 (in excess) would form SCl4 or SCl2? Wait, sulfur with Cl2 under certain conditions forms SCl4. But SCl4 is a liquid, not a gas. Alternatively, maybe A is P (phosphorus). P reacting with Cl2 in some conditions forms PCl5. Wait, PCl5 has 5 Cl per P. But in the first reaction, 8 equivalents. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe A is sodium (Na), but 8Cl would be NaCl2? No, that's not possible because sodium typically forms +1 ions.

Wait, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2. 8 equivalents would mean 8 O2 molecules? Or perhaps B is something else. Alternatively, maybe A is an element that forms a compound with 8 atoms of B. Let's see.

Another approach: the product C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G weak. So maybe C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is SOCl2, then hydrolysis gives HCl (strong) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). That fits. Wait, but SOCl2 is a compound where each molecule has 1 S, 2 O, and 2 Cl. Wait, no, SOCl2 is S-O-Cl2? Or is it SCl2O? No, the formula is SOCl2. So when SOCl2 reacts with water, it produces HCl and H2SO3. HCl is strong, H2SO3 is weak. That fits. So maybe C is SOCl2.

If that's the case, then in reaction 1, A + 8B → C. SOCl2 is produced from something plus 8 B. Let's see, SOCl2 can be formed from S (solid) reacting with Cl2 gas. The reaction is S + Cl2 → SOCl2? Wait, S + Cl2 under certain conditions can form SOCl2. Let me think: S (solid) + Cl2 (gas) → SOCl2? Let me check the stoichiometry. The reaction for SOCl2 formation from S and Cl2 is: S(s) + Cl2(g) → SOCl2(l). But the stoichiometry here is 1 S : 2 Cl2. So for each S, you need 2 moles of Cl2. So the equivalents would be 2 equivalents of Cl2 per S. But in the first reaction, the problem states that 8 equivalents of B are used. So if B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 Cl2 molecules per A. So for 1 mole of A, 8 moles of B (Cl2) are consumed. So maybe the reaction is A + 8 B → C, which in this case would be S + 8 Cl2 → 8 SOCl2? That can't be, because each SOCl2 needs 2 Cl2. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Let's think of another compound. What about SiCl4? No, that's more about silicon. Let me think about C being a chloride of some element.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride). Thionyl chloride is SOCl2, as I thought earlier. So, in reaction 1, A could be S (sulfur), and B is Cl2. The reaction is S(s) + Cl2(g) → SOCl2(l). But the stoichiometry is 1 S and 2 Cl2. So for 1 mole of S, 2 moles of Cl2 are needed. But the question says 8 equivalents of B for one equivalent of A. So that would not fit. Therefore, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction for C is the formation of a compound with 8 equivalents of B. For instance, if B is H2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 H2 molecules. But how does that fit into the reactions? Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a diatomic gas like O2, but I'm not sure. Let me try another angle.

Looking at reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So C is likely a compound that upon hydrolysis yields two different acids. Strong and weak. For example, if C is SOCl2, then as I said earlier, it gives HCl (strong) and H2SO3 (weak). That makes sense. Alternatively, if C is something like PCl5, hydrolysis gives HCl (strong) and H3PO4 (which can be considered a moderately strong acid; not sure if it's weak. Wait, H3PO4 is a weak acid. So that could fit. So C could be PCl5.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. If C is PCl5 (PCl5), then the reaction is P + Cl2 → PCl5. The stoichiometry is P + 5/2 Cl2 → PCl5. So for 1 P, 5 Cl2 molecules are needed. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) are used. So 8 Cl2 per A. So if A is P, then 1 P would need 5 Cl2. But the problem says 8, which doesn't match. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think of another possibility.

Another approach: the second reaction is C + 2 D → E. D is a gas. When D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio, it forms H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H. H is a solvent, so possible candidates are H2O, ethanol, etc. But since D and B are gases, their reaction product is a solvent. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2, then their reaction would be Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: B is O2 and D is H2. Then O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. H2O is a solvent. But in that case, D is H2 gas, B is O2. Then in reaction 2, C + 2 H2 → E. What would E be? Maybe something like CH4? Not sure.

Wait, but the first reaction has 8 equivalents of B. If B is O2, 8 moles per A. So for example, if A is Fe, then Fe reacts with O2 to form Fe3O4. The reaction is 3 Fe + 2 O2 → Fe3O4. So per 3 Fe, 2 O2 are used. So not 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Let me think of the reaction where a solid reacts with a diatomic gas in multiple equivalents. For example, perhaps A is Na metal, and B is Cl2. The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So each NaCl has one Cl. So per Na, one Cl2 molecule. So for 8 Cl2, maybe 4 Na would react: 4 Na + 8 Cl2 → 4 NaCl4? Wait, but NaCl4 doesn't exist. Hmm.

Alternatively, if A is S (sulfur), and B is O2. The reaction of S with O2 gives SO2 or SO3. For example, 2 S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. So 3 O2 per 2 S. But in our case, 8 equivalents of B (O2) per A (S). So for 1 S, 8 O2. So S + 8 O2 → something. Not sure what that would be. Maybe SO4^2-? No, that's more about reacting with water.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound with a high number of B atoms. Let me think about something else.

Wait, perhaps B is a diatomic gas like F2. Let's think about A being something that reacts with F2. For example, sodium (Na) reacts with F2 to form NaF. But that's 1 F2 per Na. Not 8.

Wait, maybe A is phosphorus and B is F2. The reaction for P with F2 is P + 3 F2 → PF6. Wait, no, that's not correct. The actual reaction is P + F2 → PF3 or PF5, depending on conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is carbon. C reacting with F2? Not sure, but carbon can form CF4.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the product E. Because the question is about the symmetry of E. So E's structure will determine its point group.

Looking at the options, the possible point groups are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Point groups like D4h suggest a high degree of symmetry, perhaps a square planar or octahedral structure. D∞h is for linear molecules with high symmetry, like CO2. C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. C2v has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

Wait, what is the structure of product E? Let's think about E's formation. C reacts with 2 D to form E. If C is SOCl2, and D is something that reacts with B (Cl2) to form H, a solvent.

Wait, in the fourth point, D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Let's suppose D is H2. Then B is Cl2. So H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H2 + O2 → H2O. That's a solvent. So if D is H2 and B is O2, then H is H2O.

So in reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → E. If C is SOCl2, then SOCl2 + 2 H2 → E. What would that produce? SOCl2 reacts with H2? I'm not sure what reaction that would be. Alternatively, perhaps C is COCl2, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if C is a different compound. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G weak. If C is SOCl2, then upon hydrolysis, it gives HCl (strong) and H2SO3 (weak). So that fits.

So E is the product of C (SOCl2) reacting with 2 equivalents of D. What is D? D reacts with B (Cl2) in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D + Cl2 → H (solvent). So what's a reaction where a gas D and Cl2 react to form a solvent? For example, if D is H2, then Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl (but that's a gas, not a solvent). So maybe D is something else.

Alternatively, if D is NH3 (but that's a gas?), but NH3 is a gas but can react with Cl2. Cl2 + NH3 → NH2Cl and HCl. But I'm not sure if that's a solvent. Or if D is another gas.

Wait, wait. Another thought: if B is O2, and D is H2, then their reaction would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. H2O is a solvent. So in that case, reaction 4 is D (H2) + B (O2) → H2O (H). Then, in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 D (H2) → E. So C reacts with H2. If C is SOCl2, then SOCl2 + H2 would produce what? Probably a reduction reaction. SOCl2 has Cl in the -1 oxidation state. H2 is a reducing agent. So perhaps it reduces SOCl2 to H2S and HCl? Not sure. Alternatively, another product.

Wait, maybe C is something else. Let me consider another approach. Since E is produced by C and D, and D is H2 in this scenario, perhaps E is a compound that forms when C reacts with H2. For example, if C is COCl2, then COCl2 + H2 might produce something like CH2Cl2, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCl gas, but that's a gas and not a product that would have a high symmetry group. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like H2S, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the point group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

D4h is a common point group for molecules like octahedral structures or certain transition metal complexes. D∞h is for linear molecules like CO2, H2O (but in linear form?), wait no, H2O is VSEPR trigonal planar, but its structure isn't linear. Wait, O=C=O is linear, so CO2 is D∞h. H2O is bent with C2v symmetry.

If E is CO2, then its point group is D∞h. So if E is CO2, that would correspond to option B or C. Wait, the options are B) D4h and C) D∞h. So that would be option C.

But how would E be CO2? Let me think. If E is CO2, how would it form from C and D?

If C is SOCl2 and D is O2, then reaction 2 would be SOCl2 + 2 O2 → CO2 + ...? Let's see: SOCl2 + O2 → CO2 + SO2 + Cl2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps other reactions.

Wait, maybe E is CO (carbon monoxide), which has a linear structure and D∞h symmetry. But CO is a gas, but the problem says E is extremely hazardous. CO is indeed toxic.

Wait, but how would we get E as CO? Let's see.

If C is COCl2, and D is something that can produce CO upon reaction. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the reaction between C and D. If C is SOCl2 and D is H2, then perhaps E is H2S and HCl. But that's a mixture, not a single product.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think about E's possible structure and its point group.

If E is a linear molecule, its point group would be D∞h (like CO2, O2, etc.). If it's a molecule with a two-fold axis and a mirror plane, maybe C2v (like water, H2O has C2v symmetry). Or maybe a molecule with a four-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (D4h), like methane? No, methane is tetrahedral and has Td symmetry.

Wait, another thought: E could be a diatomic molecule. Many diatomic molecules have D∞h symmetry. For example, O2, N2, Cl2, etc. Alternatively, if E is O2, then the point group would be D∞h (option C). But how would O2 form from the reaction of C and D?

Wait, let's recap the earlier points.

We have D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let's suppose B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then H2 + O2 → H2O, which is a solvent. So H is H2O. So D is H2.

So in reaction 2: C reacts with 2 D (H2) to form E. If C is SOCl2, then SOCl2 + 2 H2 → ? What's the product? Maybe it's a reduction reaction. SOCl2 has the structure SOCl2, with S in +4 oxidation state. If H2 is a reducing agent, perhaps it reduces S to S-2. Let me think about the reaction:

SOCl2 + H2 → H2S + 2 HCl.

So that would produce H2S (a gas, which is extremely hazardous) and HCl. But the product E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps E is H2S.

What's the structure of H2S? It's a bent molecule, similar to H2O. The point group is C2v (option D). So if E is H2S, then the symmetry group is C2v.

But wait, in that case, E is H2S, which is H2S, a molecule with a bent structure, so it's C2v symmetry. So the correct option would be D) C2v.

Alternatively, another possibility: if E is O2, which is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So which is more likely?

Wait, but if C is SOCl2 and D is H2, then reaction 2 is SOCl2 + 2 H2 → H2S + 2 HCl. So E is H2S. So the symmetry group would be C2v.

But let me double-check the possible structures of E.

Another possibility: If C is SO2Cl2, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Alternatively, perhaps C is something else.

Wait, let me think again about reaction 1. If A is S, and B is Cl2, then reaction 1 is S + 8 Cl2 → C. What would C be? 8 Cl2 per S. So that would be SCl8? Or is that a thing? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces SOCl2, but the stoichiometry doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think about another scenario. Suppose B is O2 and A is C (carbon). Then reaction 1 is C + 8 O2 → CO4? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming CO2, but 8 O2 per C would be C O8, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let's try to summarize:

- E is the product of C reacting with 2 D.
- D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H (a solvent).
- C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), G (weak acid).

If H is H2O (solvent), then D and B must react to form H2O. So D + B → H2O. So if B is O2 and D is H2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O.

So in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 H2 to form E.

If C is SOCl2, then SOCl2 + 2 H2 → H2S + 2 HCl. So E is H2S, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. So the molecular symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

Alternatively, if C is something else, but I'm going with this line of reasoning.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests that A and B combine in a specific stoichiometric ratio. For example, if B is Cl₂, A could be an element like sulfur (S), forming a compound such as SOCl₂.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O₂ and D is H₂, their reaction would yield H₂O, a common solvent. Thus, D is likely H₂, and B is O₂.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If C is SOCl₂, hydrolysis would yield HCl (strong acid) and H₂SO₃ (weak acid), which fits the description.

4. **Reaction 2 Revisited**: With C as SOCl₂ and D as H₂, the reaction SOCl₂ + 2 H₂ → H₂S + 2 HCl is plausible. This makes E H₂S, a highly hazardous gas.

5. **Molecular Symmetry of E**: H₂S is a bent molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane, corresponding to the C₂v point group.

Thus, the molecular symmetry group of E is **C₂v**.
