Okay, so I have this question about astrophysics, specifically dealing with redshift and the detection of quasars through neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for hydrogen. But wait, when we talk about absorption, the cloud would be absorbing at a certain redshifted wavelength.

So the main point is figuring out the redshift. The quasar's light is being absorbed by these clouds, but we're trying to detect this using optical ground-based telescopes. Oh right, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere blocks it. So if the Lyman alpha line is shifted into the optical range, we can observe it.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers or 121.6 nm. That's in the far ultraviolet, right? So if the cloud is at a high redshift, the wavelength would be stretched. The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength. So observed wavelength = rest * (1 + z).

But wait, the quasar emits in the optical, but the neutral hydrogen is in front of it. So the quasar's light goes through the cloud, and the cloud absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength, so we see absorption lines in the quasar's spectrum at that redshifted wavelength.

But the quasar itself emits light across the spectrum, including the optical. So the quasar's visible light can be observed, but the absorption line from the hydrogen cloud is at a longer wavelength. For an optical telescope, the detection would be in the visible range, so the redshifted Lyman alpha has to fall into the optical.

The visible spectrum (optical) is roughly from 400 nm to 700 nm. So the observed wavelength has to be within that range. Let's calculate the minimum redshift needed for 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) to be observed in optical.

So, 121.6 nm * (1 + z) = lambda_observed. We need lambda_observed >= 400 nm.

Wait, no, wait: 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is less than 400 nm. So when the cloud is at rest relative to us, the Lyman alpha is at 121.6 nm (far UV, not visible), but when it's redshifted, it moves into the optical range.

So setting lambda_obs >= 400 nm:

121.6 nm * (1 + z) >= 400 nm
Divide both sides by 121.6:

(1 + z) >= 400 / 121.6 â‰ˆ 3.293
So z >= 2.293 approximately.

Wait, that's about 2.29. But the options are 3, 1.2, 2.4,
