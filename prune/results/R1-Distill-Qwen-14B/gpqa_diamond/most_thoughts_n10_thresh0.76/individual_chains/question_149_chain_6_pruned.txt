Okay, so I've got this question here about a peptidic compound's NMR and LC-MS analysis. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound mostly looks as expected, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Wait, so each is around 0.5H? Or maybe one is 0.5 and the other 0.5, so together 1H. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not like they're splitting each other or something like that.

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. So the mass is the same, but there are two peaks. That suggests maybe two different compounds with the same mass, but same molecular weight? But then, same mass and same molecular formula would mean they're either enantiomers, diastereomers, or something else.

Wait, the same molecular weight but different structures? Or perhaps they're not structures but maybe different ionization forms? Hmm, but the question says the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule. So same mass, same structure, but perhaps different in some other way.

So for the NMR part, the two peaks for the same proton. Since the coupling is ruled out, maybe it's something else. When you have two peaks for the same proton without coupling, what else could cause that? Maybe if the proton is in a different environment in different molecules. Like in diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra because they're mirror images. So if the compound is a pair of enantiomers, the NMR would not show two separate peaks for the same proton. Because each enantiomer's protons are in identical environments but mirrored, so the NMR would just look the same as one. So the NMR would show a single peak, not two. So if there are two peaks, that might not be due to enantiomers. Unless... Wait, the question says that the NMR peaks integrate to 1H in total. So if each is 0.5H, maybe each is from a different diastereomer.

Wait, diastereomers
