Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring connected to a propenal group. Trans-cinnamaldehyde would have the double bond in the trans configuration, so the substituents on either end are opposite each other. The structure is something like Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO, but wait, no, wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is aromatic: it has a benzene ring attached to a propenal group. Propenal is CH₂=CH-CHO. So the structure would be benzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached. Wait, no, wait. The structure is benzene ring connected to a CH₂ group, which is connected to a CH₂ group with a double bond to the aldehyde. So it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Let me get this right. Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that's not right. Wait, the formula of cinnamaldehyde is C9H8O. So benzene (C6H5) connected to CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, the correct structure is C6H5-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that can't be because that would be longer. Oh wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, no, that would have four carbons in the chain. Wait, maybe it's C6H5-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, wait. Alternatively, I think the structure is C6H5-CH₂-CH₂-CHO, but that would be more like cinnamyl aldehyde. Hmm. Maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what
