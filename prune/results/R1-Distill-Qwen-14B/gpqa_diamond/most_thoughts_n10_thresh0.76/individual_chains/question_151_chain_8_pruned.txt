Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, those are just three numbers. So I think that's a vector in three-dimensional space, maybe like a state vector in a 3-level system. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state of a system is usually represented as a column vector in a Hilbert space, right?

Then there's this observable, P, which is a matrix operator. The matrix is given with three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability of each outcome is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude corresponding to that eigenvalue.

Wait, but wait, how do I find the probability of getting a specific eigenvalue, like 0 here? Let me think. So I think the process is: find the eigenvalues of the matrix P, then identify which eigenvalue is 0. Then, find the eigenvector associated with that eigenvalue, and then compute the inner product of the state vector with that eigenvector. The square of the absolute value of that inner product gives the probability.

Alternatively, maybe I should represent the state vector as a column vector and then compute the expectation value, but wait, the question isn't about the expectation value. It's about the probability of getting a specific outcome when measuring P, which is 0.

Wait, let me make sure. So the observable is P, and when you measure it, you get one of its eigenvalues. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's compute them.

So P is a 3x3 matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, maybe it's easier to write it out as:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Eigenvalues of P: Let's find them. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix (P - λ I) is:

[
[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

The determinant of this matrix is zero. Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- 1/√2 * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ]
+ 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, because the first element is -λ, and minors are calculated accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps expanding along the first row.

So,

det = (-λ) * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) 
      - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] )
      + 0 * det(...)

So compute each minor.

First minor: for element (1,1), which is -λ:

The minor matrix is:
[
[-λ, 1/√2],
[1/√2, -λ]
]

Its determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

Second term: for element (1,2) which is 1/√2, the minor is the matrix:

[
[1/√2, 1/√2],
[0, -λ]
]

The determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = (-λ)/√2.

Wait, but the sign for the second term in the expansion is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1. So the second term in the determinant is:

- (1/√2) * [ (-λ)/√2 ) ] * (-1) ?

Wait, let me think again. The expansion along the first row is:

sum_{j=1 to 3} [ (-1)^(1+j) * M_{1j} * a_{1j} ]

Where M_{1j} is the minor for element (1,j). So for j=2, the element is 1/√2, and the minor is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix that remains after removing row 1 and column 2.

So the minor matrix for (1,2) is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, -λ]

Wait no, when you remove row 1 and column 2, you're left with:

Rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and
