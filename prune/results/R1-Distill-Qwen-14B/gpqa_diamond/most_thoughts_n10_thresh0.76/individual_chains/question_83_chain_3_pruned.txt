Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations, but let's give it a shot. Let me read the question again.

We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, and the Ka is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, first, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution. So, the initial step is mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Let's calculate that.

The formula I remember is M1V1 = M2V2. Wait, no, actually, when you dilute, the moles remain the same, right? So, moles of acetic acid before dilution would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). So that's 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Then, the total volume after dilution is 20 + 20 = 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration would be moles divided by volume, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid we have. It's 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol, same as before. So NaOH needed: 0.1 M * V = 0.001 mol. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So that's when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but actually, no. Wait, the problem says 25% titration. So that's when 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So in that case, the moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 times the moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. So 25% is 0.00025 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume added would be 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. Yeah, that's right.

So now, for the pH at 25% titration, I think we need to calculate the pH of a buffer solution. Because at 25% titration, only part of the acetic acid has been neutralized, so we'll have a buffer of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation might be useful here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where A- is the conjugate base (acetate) and HA is acetic acid.

So, let's find the concentrations. Let me think about the moles.

Initially, after dilution, we have 0.001 mol of acetic acid in 0.04 L. Then, when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is 0.0025 L, it will react with the acetic acid.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of acetic acid reacted: 0.00025 mol. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol, so remaining is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol of CH3COOH.

Moles of acetate (A-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution at 25% titration is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.005882 M.

So now, using the Henderson equation:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

First, pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1.85e-5) is about 4.73? Wait no, wait. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, wait. No. pKa is -log(Ka). So Ka = 1.85e-5. So log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + (-5) =
