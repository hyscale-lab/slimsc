Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about finding the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to switch from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think means it's in the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I'm guessing this involves a change in either rotational, vibrational, or both states.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model... Oh right, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule can be described by two quantum numbers: v for vibrational state and l for rotational state. The total energy is a combination of both. So the fundamental state would be v=0 and l=0, I suppose.

The next lowest energy state after the fundamental state would be the next available state. Since vibrational energy levels are quantized and higher in energy than rotational ones, perhaps the transition is a vibrational one. Or maybe it's a rotational transition. But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B l(l+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency.

But wait, the question says the molecule can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, but maybe that's not directly relevant here. I'm not too sure about the details of that model.

So the fundamental state is the lowest energy, which is v=0 and l=0. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next vibrational level, v=1, because the vibrational energy is higher than rotational. Alternatively, if the molecule is in v=0 and l=0, the next state could involve l=1 (next rotational state) but that's lower in energy than v=1. Wait, no, the rotational energy depends on l(l+1), so l=1 is higher than l=0, but how does that compare to the first vibrational state?

Wait, let me calculate the energies. The vibrational energy for v=0 is (0
