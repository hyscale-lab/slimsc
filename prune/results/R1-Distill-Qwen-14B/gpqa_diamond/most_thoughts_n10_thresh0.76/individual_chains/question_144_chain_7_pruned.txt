Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV.

Wait, wait. I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the decay width Γ. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

But wait, the decay distance, not the lifetime. Oh right, because the particle is moving, the mean decay distance L is the product of the velocity v and the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity? I think I can use the energy and mass to find the velocity. The production energy E is the total energy of the meson, so E = γ m c². Since it's a resonance, I suppose it's moving relativistically.

Wait, but let me get the steps right. First, find the velocity. Then find the lifetime, then multiply them to get L.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula that combines these steps. I think the decay length can be calculated using the formula L = (E * ħ c) / (m² c^4 Γ) * something? Wait, maybe I should approach it step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the lifetime τ.
