Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options (A to D) each proposing a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence is correct.

First, I should probably sketch out the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions: a bromine and a nitro group. Then, attached to that is an ethanone group (a ketone with a methyl group, but I think ethan-1-one is (methyl)(methyl) ketone? Wait, no, ethan-1-one is actually methyl phenyl ketone. Wait, ethanone is acetone, but in this case, it's 1-phenylethanone, which would be a benzophenone structure, where the ketone is attached to the benzene ring. Oh wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one. So the structure is (Ph group)(CH3)CO, right? No. Wait, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO. Wait, no: ethan-1-one is where the ketone is at the first carbon. So it's R-CO-CH3. Wait, no, ethanone is (propan-2-one), which is (CH3)2CO. Maybe I should think of it as a benzene ring attached to a ketone at one position, and the ketone is connected to another carbon (so perhaps the ring is attached to the carbonyl, and the other side is a methyl group). So the structure would be a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5 (Br and NO2), and at position 1 (the ketone group), but wait, the numbering might be different. Alternatively, the benzene is attached to a ketone group, and the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring. So the ketone is attached to the benzene in such a way that the substituents are at
