Okay, let's try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on spectroscopy, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, each with a similar backbone but varying substituents.

First, the FTIR part. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests O-H or N-H stretching, but since the options all have a COOH group, which is a carboxylic acid, that makes sense. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches because of hydrogen bonding. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is probably the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the carboxylic acid. So that fits all the options, since each has a COOH group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The NMR shows several peaks, but none are vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds in the structure, or at least no protons adjacent to double bonds. So, any possibility of a double bond is out, but looking at the options, I don't see any with double bonds. So that's probably not an issue here.

Next, the NMR signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns. Each split indicates neighboring protons. So, a quartet would come from three neighboring protons, a triplet from two, and a doublet from one.

Wait, the splitting is a series. So, the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's break that down. Maybe each splitting is from adjacent groups. Like, maybe the proton is next to a group that has a triplet, which itself is next to a quartet. Or perhaps it's a multiplet resulting from coupling with multiple sets of neighboring protons.

Another approach: in the NMR, each peak's splitting tells us about the neighboring hydrogens. Let's consider each option's structure.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the structure is CH2COOH connected to a central CH group, which is connected to two C2H5 groups on either side. Wait, no, let me draw it. Wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So, the central part is two CH groups each attached to two ethyl groups. Then CH2 connected to COOH.

So, in this structure, the central CHs (they're each attached to two ethyl groups) would have neighboring groups. The CH2 group is next to the central CH. Let's think about the NMR signals for each.

Looking for the CH2 group in option A: The CH2 is next to a CH group. The CH has four neighboring groups: maybe each CH is attached to two ethyl groups and two other CHs? Wait, each CH is connected to two ethyl groups and two CHs? Wait, no. The structure is probably more like:

The molecule is like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the two middle CHs each have two ethyl groups and are connected to each other, perhaps. So each CH is attached to two ethyl groups, plus the adjacent CH groups.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

So the central two CHs each have two ethyl groups attached, plus they're connected to each other. So each CH is connected to two ethyl groups and another CH. So each CH would have two neighboring CHs. Wait, but each CH is attached to two ethyl groups and the adjacent CH. So each CH group would have how many neighboring protons?

Wait,
