Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem involves an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200Â°C without air, and only a mixture of gases is formed. Then, these gases are passed through several tubes. The first tube has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second is Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper.

The results are that tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, tube 3 gained 0.80 grams, and tube 2 didn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure. We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let me break this down. So, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose, releasing gases. The gases then pass through these tubes, which react with the gases in specific ways.

First, let's think about each tube. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent. But wait, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water vapor. So, when the gas mixture passes through, if any water vapor is present, it would be absorbed here, increasing the tube's weight. But in this case, tube 1 gained 3.60 grams. So that suggests that 3.60 grams of water were absorbed. Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, so it absorbs water, right? So the gas mixture must have contained water vapor, which was absorbed by tube 1, adding 3.60g.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas mixture had any CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form calcium carbonate precipitate. But the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change, which suggests that no CO2 was present. Or maybe CO2 was present but didn't react? Wait, but Ca(OH)2 solution would definitely absorb CO2. So perhaps the gas that passed through didn't have any CO2, which might mean that any CO2 was already removed earlier. But wait, tube 1 is before tube 2. So if the gas had CO2, it would have reacted in tube 2, but since the tube's weight didn't change, no CO2 passed through. So, that suggests that any CO2 was already removed, maybe in tube 1? No, because Mg(ClO4)2 doesn't react with CO2. Wait, no, Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, but CO2 is a gas that doesn't react with it. So, the CO2 would have passed through tube 1 and into tube 2, where it would have been absorbed. Since tube 2's weight didn't change, the gas mixture didn't have any CO2. So that means that any CO2 produced during decomposition was somehow not present in the gas mixture.

Wait,
