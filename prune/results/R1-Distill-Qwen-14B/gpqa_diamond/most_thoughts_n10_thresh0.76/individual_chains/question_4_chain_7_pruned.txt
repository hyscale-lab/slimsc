Okay, so I have this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles, so you can't isolate a single pole. But Maxwell's equations make that assumption, right?

Wait, Maxwell's equations... There are four of them. Let me think about each one. The first one is Gauss's law for electricity. That's about the divergence of E equals rho over epsilon naught. I don't think that's affected here because that's about electric charge, not magnetism.

The second equation is Gauss's law for magnetism. Oh yes, that's the one that says the divergence of B is zero. Because in our world, magnetic monopoles don't exist, so the flux through any closed surface is zero. But if in this universe, you can have isolated N or S poles, then that equation must change. So divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. So that equation would be different.

The third equation is Faraday's law of induction. It relates the curl of E to the negative rate of change of B. That equation doesn't directly involve the existence of monopoles, so I think it stays the same.

The fourth equation is Ampère-Maxwell's law. That's the one with the curl of H equals the current plus the displacement current. But wait, Ampère's original law didn't have the displacement current; Maxwell added that. But how does that relate to magnetic monopoles?

Wait, if there are isolated magnetic charges, then we might need to modify Ampère's law. Oh, right! Because in our world, magnetic monopoles don't exist, so the divergence of B is zero. But if they do exist, then the divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. But how does that affect the other equations?

Oh right, there's something called the dual formulation of Maxwell's equations where you can swap E and B and electric and magnetic charges. So if you have magnetic charges, then you have to modify the equations accordingly.

So the equations would be: the divergence of B would equal the magnetic charge density, similar to how divergence of E equals electric charge density. Also, the curl of E would have a term involving the current of magnetic charges, similar to how curl of B has the current plus displacement current.

Wait, let me get this right. The modified Maxwell's equations would be:
