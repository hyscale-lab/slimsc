Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, which makes sense because particles decay quickly, so the distance shouldn't be too big.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime τ. The relation is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/(Γ). But wait, I think Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s, so I'll need to convert units properly.

Also, the decay distance is the product of the velocity v and the lifetime τ. So the mean decay length L = v * τ. But how do I find the velocity?

The meson is produced with energy E_X, which is 8 GeV. Its mass is 1.2 GeV, so I can use the relativistic energy relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Wait, but maybe it's easier to find the velocity using beta (β) = v/c.

Alternatively, beta can be found using the relation E = γ m c^2. So γ = E/(m c²). Wait, units—since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², I can calculate gamma directly.

So E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ is about 6.6667.

Then, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/γ. So 1 - β² = 1/γ². Then, β² = 1 - 1/(γ²) = 1 - (1/(6.6667)^2). Let me compute that.

6.6667 squared is approximately 44.444. So 1/44.444 is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So β squared is 0.9775, so beta is sqrt(0.9775). Let me calculate that. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So β is about 0.9887, so v is about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Now, the lifetime τ. As I said earlier, τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to convert Γ into the same units as ħ. Γ is given as 320 MeV. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, let me double-check that calculation:

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32:

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no—wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.
