Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? And that happens when a compound has chiral centers, which are carbons attached to four different groups. But wait, there are exceptions too, like if there's a plane of symmetry or some other factors that prevent chirality.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure here is a double bond with substituents. Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but the double bond is at position 1, so it's actually Cl attached to a double bond. Wait, no, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-C(=CH(CH3))-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So
