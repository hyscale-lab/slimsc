Okay, so I've got this problem here where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence as input and gives a number as output. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. My task is to figure out what the algorithm does and then apply it to the sequence ACAGTGACC to see which option is correct.

Hmm, first, I need to understand the pattern here. Let's look at the first example: AGG. The output is 115. Let me break this down. Each nucleotide is a letterâ€”A, T, C, G. Maybe each of these letters corresponds to a number. I remember that in some cases, A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, and G is 4. Or wait, maybe they represent the number of something else, like their position in the alphabet. Oh wait, A is the 1st letter, T is 20th, C is 3rd, G is 7th. Wait, but that might not add up. Alternatively, maybe it's the numerical value of each letter's position, summed up.

Let me check the first example. AGG is A, G, G. A is 1, G is 7. So 1 +7 +7=15. But the output is 115. That's way higher than 15. Hmm, maybe each letter is multiplied by a certain value, not just added.

Wait, another thought: perhaps each nucleotide is converted to its position in the alphabet, and then those numbers are concatenated. Wait, but for AGG, that would be 1,7,7. So 177. No, that's not 115.

Wait, maybe it's a different approach. Let me think about binary or another base. Or perhaps each nucleotide is assigned a value and then multiplied by the position in the string. Like A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4. Then for each position, multiply the value by (position +1) or something.

Wait, let's test this with the first example. AGG is three letters. So positions 1,2,3.

A is 1, position 1: 1*1=1.

G is
