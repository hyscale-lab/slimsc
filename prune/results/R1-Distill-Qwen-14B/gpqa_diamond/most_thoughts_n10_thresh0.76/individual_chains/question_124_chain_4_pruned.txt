Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Okay, the question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and they travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. Now, the radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the inner walls?

Hmm. So, let's think about what determines how far a particle travels before decaying. I remember that the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is gamma times the lab frame lifetime. Wait, no, wait. The lifetime in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So, a particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times longer than its proper lifetime. That means that the particle can travel a longer distance before decaying. 

The detector's radius is 30 meters. The particle starts at the center, so the maximum distance it has to travel to reach the wall is 30 meters. So, the time it takes to reach the wall is the distance divided by its speed. But wait, at ultra-relativistic speeds, the speed is approximately the speed of light, so we can approximate the time as t = R / c, where R is the radius and c is the speed of light.

Wait, but the speed isn't exactly c. Wait, but for high Lorentz factors, v is very close to c. So, perhaps it's a good approximation to use v ≈ c. Let me think—ultra-relativistic means v is very close to c, so that's a valid approximation.

So, the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = R / (v) ≈ R / c. Since R is 30 meters, t = 30 m / 3e8 m/s. Let me compute that. 30 / 3e8 is 1e-7 seconds, which is 0.1 microseconds. Hmm, that's a very short time.

The proper lifetime of the particle is tau. So, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. The particle will decay after a time that's a certain fraction of the lab frame lifetime. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it reaches the wall is the exponential decay probability. The decay follows an exponential distribution, I think. So, the probability P that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is P = exp(-t / tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma * tau.

Wait, no. Wait. The decay probability is P(t) = e^(-t/tau), where tau is the mean lifetime. But in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper mean lifetime. So, tau_lab = gamma * tau. So, P(t) = e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

So, the decay probability after time t is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)). But wait, no: the survival probability is e^(-t/(gamma tau)). So, the probability that the particle reaches the wall is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but the problem says that when the Lorentz factor is ~20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So, 1/3 = e^(-t/(20 tau)).

So, I can write that equation. Let's write the equation for the first scenario: gamma1 = 20, P1 = 1/3.

1/3 = e^(-t/(gamma1 * tau)).

Then, for the second scenario, we want P2 = 2/3. Let's express that
