Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The reagents it's reacted with are NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. I remember that when you react something with nitrous acid (from NaNO2 and HCl), it's often a diazotization reaction, which typically happens with aromatic amines, especially aniline derivatives. But wait, the compound here has an N, so maybe it's an aromatic amine.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). That's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's adjacent to some coupling. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton? Wait, no, aldehydes are deshielded and appear upfield compared to aromatic protons, which are usually around 6-8. So 9.72 is likely an aldehyde. But why a triplet? Aldehydes are usually split based on adjacent protons. Maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group or something else that causes splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol tautomer, but I'm not sure.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like two aromatic protons as a doublet. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring. Because in para-substituted benzene, the H's are adjacent to the substituent and would couple with one another. Or maybe it's a meta substitution.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H). Another doublet, also two H's. Could this be part of another aromatic ring, maybe ortho to substituents?

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet for two protons. Maybe an -OH group? No, because -OH protons are usually broader and maybe around 1-5 ppm, but not always. Wait, that's 6.27, which is more aromatic region. Broad singlet suggests maybe some exchange or coupling, like in an allylic position or maybe some diastereotopic protons? Or perhaps it's a pair of protons that are equivalent but deshielded, like in a conjugated system, such as an enol.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet for two H's. That's around where methylene groups next to oxygen (like OCH2) appear. So maybe an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a CH2 connected to something else. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring group, maybe adjacent to a CH that's split into a doublet.

Putting this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=
