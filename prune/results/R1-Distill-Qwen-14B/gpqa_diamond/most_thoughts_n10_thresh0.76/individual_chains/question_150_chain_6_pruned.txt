Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. The options are four different products, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I need to analyze the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR shows several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, let me try to piece this together. The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet (t, 1H). That's a pretty high chemical shift—could be an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm. So perhaps this is an aldehyde group, maybe in an aromatic aldehyde or something similar.

Looking at the other peaks: the 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) suggest two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. This is characteristic of two aromatic rings, perhaps para-substituted. Wait, no, wait—if it's two doublets each with 2H, that might be two adjacent aromatic protons each. Or maybe it's a para-substituted benzene next to another substituent.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a conjugated diene or something like that. But looking at the other peaks, there's 6.27 (bs, 2H)—a broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet could indicate some sort of exchange, maybe an enol proton or perhaps an NH group. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen. So maybe an amide or an amine?

Wait, but the reaction steps might give a clue. Let me look at the reagents:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: That's usually for diazotization. So that's a reaction that converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. But wait, the starting compound has an NO group—so maybe it's an aromatic amine?

Wait, but the starting formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. X is 0 here.

So (2*8 + 2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring, one double bond, and another ring (since each ring or double bond is one degree). Or maybe a benzene ring (3 degrees) and a double bond (1) and another ring (1), or something like that.

Looking back at the NMR, the 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet. Aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets, but sometimes coupling with adjacent protons can cause splitting. Wait, but in an aldehyde, the aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because it's only attached to one carbon. So if it's a triplet, perhaps it's part of a conjugated system. Like maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So maybe something like CH2=CH-CHO, but that's just a thought.

Wait, let's think about the aromatic signals. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each 2H. If they are para-substituted on a benzene ring, the protons are usually split into doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, the protons would be deshielded. Wait, but 6.98 is lower field than 6.51, meaning the substituents are more de
