Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me think through how to approach it. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy spectrum for a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that looks like a potential that depends on both r and θ, so maybe it's polar coordinates. 

Wait, in two dimensions, when you have a potential that depends on r and θ, you can often separate the problem into radial and angular parts. But wait, I remember that for a central potential, which only depends on r, the problem separates nicely. But here, the potential also depends on cos²θ. So it's not purely central. That complicates things because the potential depends on the angle θ.

So, let's think about the form of V(r, θ). Let me rewrite it for clarity: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that can be written as (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. So it's a function of r² and cos squared theta. 

Wait, maybe I can express cos²θ in terms of something else. Oh right, cos²θ can be expressed using double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ]

Let me compute that. Let's see:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = (2 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)) / 2 
= (2 +3 +3 cos2θ)/2 
= (5 +3 cos2θ)/2 

So V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² * (5 +3 cos2θ)/2 
= (kr²)(5 +3 cos2θ)/4 
= (5kr²)/4 + (3kr² cos2θ)/4 

So the potential is a sum of terms involving r² and cos2θ. Wait, so the potential has a term that varies with cos2θ, which suggests that the angular part of the potential is non-zero and depends on 2θ.
