Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in QFT, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ = c = 1). So each term must have [L] = 4.

First, I need to determine the mass dimension of each field and parameter in the term. Let's break it down.

The fields involved are ψ (the spinor), and F^{μν}, which is the field strength tensor of a gauge field. Wait, but I'm not sure what gauge field this is. Oh, wait, the term is ψ F ψ, so perhaps it's a vector field like electromagnetism or Yang-Mills. So F_{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, say A.

In QED, the photon is a vector boson, so A has mass dimension 1. Wait, no, wait. The field strength tensor F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ plus some nonlinear terms for non-Abelian. But for mass dimension, F_{μν} should have the same dimension as ∂_μ acting on A_ν. Since ∂ has dimension 1 (because it's ∂/∂x^μ, which has inverse length, so dimension 1), and A_ν has dimension 1 (since the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1, so A must have dimension 1 to match). So F_{μν} has dimension 2.

Wait, no, wait. The covariant derivative D_mu = ∂_mu + i e A_mu. Since ∂_mu has dimension 1, A_mu must also have dimension 1. So F_{mu nu} is the field strength, which is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu + terms for non-Abelian (but in this case, it's an Abelian theory because the question doesn't specify). So F has dimension [F] = [∂ A] = [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Next, the spinor fields ψ. Spinors in 4D have dimension 3/2 each. So ψ has [ψ] = 3/2, and ψ̄ is the same because it's just the adjoint.

Now, the term in the Lagrangian is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's find the dimension of each part.

First, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (they are just matrices, their trace doesn't contribute to dimensions), so σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless as well. So when we have ψ̄ σ ψ, the dimensions are [ψ̄][ψ][σ], which is (3/2) * (3/2) * 0 = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Because σ is dimensionless, the product ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3.

Then, F^{mu nu} has dimension 2. So the entire term is (3) * (2) = 5. Wait, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F must be multiplied by a coupling constant κ whose dimension will make the overall term have dimension 4.

So [κ] [
