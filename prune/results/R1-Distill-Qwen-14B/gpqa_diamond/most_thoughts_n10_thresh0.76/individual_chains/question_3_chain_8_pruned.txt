Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And it's asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured a particular observable many times on identically prepared systems.

So, the first step is to find the expectation value of each part separately, right? Because the expectation value of a sum is the sum of the expectation values. So, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ equals 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Now, since σz and σx are Pauli matrices, their expectation values can be calculated using the given state. The state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of σz, so that should make things easier for σz.

Let me write down the state ψ. It's ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively, I think the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So, for σz:
⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) * (-1)
Let me calculate those squares. 0.5 squared is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4), which is 0.75. So,
⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, that's correct? Because the coefficients squared give the probabilities, and each term is multiplied by the eigenvalue. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, onto σx. Oh, σx isn't diagonal in the σz basis, so its expectation value calculation might be a bit more involved. I think the expectation value of σx is given by ψ† σx ψ, where ψ is a column vector.

Wait, let me think. In the computational basis (|↑⟩ and |↓⟩), the Pauli matrices are represented as follows:
σz = [[1, 0],[0, -1]]
σx = [[0, 1],[1, 0]]

So, the state ψ can be written as a column vector. Let me write that down:
ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

σx is the [[0, 1], [1, 0]] matrix. So, to compute ⟨σx⟩, which is ψ† σx ψ, I'll have to multiply these out.

Alternatively, I remember that for a spin-1/2 system in state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b)/(|a|^2 + |b|^2) multiplied by 2, but wait, actually, maybe it's (a b* + a* b) divided by something else. Hmm, perhaps I should compute it directly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute ψ† σx ψ.

So, let me compute the matrix product step by step. First, ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So ψ† (the row vector) is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ].

Multiply ψ† with σx: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] 
Which would be [ (0.5)(0) + (sqrt(3)/2)(1), (0.5)(1) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0) ] 
So that gives [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ].

Then multiply this with ψ, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ]^T.

So the product is [ sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ].

Wait, let me compute that:

First term: sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = (sqrt(3)/2) * (1/2) )= sqrt(3)/4.
Second term: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = same as above, sqrt(3)/4.

So sum of the two terms is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = (2 sqrt(3))/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the expectation value is (ψ† σx ψ), which is a scalar. So yes, it's [ sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ] = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but wait, when I multiply [sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ] with [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], it's (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) which is sqrt(3)*0.5.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

But wait, I thought the expectation value of σx would be (a b* + a* b) where a and b are the coefficients. Let me check that.

The state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ where a=0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2.

Then, ⟨σx⟩ = (a b* + a* b) = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) ) = (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2, same as before. So that's correct.

So now, ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5, and ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake. Because when I compute ⟨σx⟩, I should have used the formula ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re(a b*), but wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait
