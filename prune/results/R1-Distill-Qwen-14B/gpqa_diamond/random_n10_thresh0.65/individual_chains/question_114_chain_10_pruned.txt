Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, with a reagent A, to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, like NaCN, it's probably some kind of addition reaction. Oh wait, I think it's the Stephen reduction or maybe the addition of a cyanide. Wait, but for ketones reacting with cyanide, maybe it's the benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes. Wait, no, benzoin uses NaCN but in the presence of a catalyst, like HCN. Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, I think when ketones react with HCN, they form cyanohydrins. So if the reagent is NaCN, maybe it's providing HCN? Or maybe in the presence of an acid catalyst.

Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see, the starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would add a cyanide group. So the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen would get an H. So the product would have two CH3 groups, a CN, and an OH on the same carbon. Oh, that makes sense. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + HCN â†’ cyan
