Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a molecular formula with 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. I remember that molecular formulas can give clues about the structure, like the possible degrees of unsaturation.

The NMR data is given: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). I need to interpret this to figure out the structure before any reactions happen.

Then, the compound is reacted with a sequence of reagents: first sodium nitrite and HCl, then water, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. I need to figure out what each step does and what the final product is.

Let me start by analyzing the NMR data. The peaks might correspond to different parts of the molecule.

Looking at the NMR:

- 9.72 ppm triplet (t, 1H): That's a high chemical shift. I remember that aldehydes (RCHO) typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H, which matches an aldehyde proton. However, sometimes other protons like those next to an electron-withdrawing group can show up here. But aldehyde is a common one. So maybe there's an aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm doublet (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet often suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe this is an aromatic ring with two equivalent protons, each coupling with one adjacent proton. Like a para-substituted benzene ring, but maybe substituted with something else...

Wait, aromatic protons are usually split into multiple peaks based on substitution. Alternatively, if it's a para-substituted benzene, the protons are equivalent and could show as a doublet if each is adjacent to another. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: in a para-substituted benzene, like p-xylene, each pair of adjacent protons would be equivalent, and in the NMR, they might appear as a doublet or a singlet depending on substitution. Hmm.

Alternatively, another possibility is that this is a vinyl proton, but the shift is more like aromatic. Wait, 6.
