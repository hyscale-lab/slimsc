Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. So, there's a light beam going through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is, what is the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab?

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that when you have different reference frames, especially when objects are moving, you might need to use some relativity concepts. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v. So, how does that affect the speed of light inside it?

Wait, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Normally, the speed in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. What if the medium is moving?

Wait, I think that in classical mechanics, velocities add linearly. Like, if the medium is moving at v, then the speed of light in the medium would be v_medium = v + (c/n). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the medium is moving, how does that affect the speed as observed from the lab?

Wait a second, I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The medium is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the medium. So, from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about it using the relativistic velocity addition formula
