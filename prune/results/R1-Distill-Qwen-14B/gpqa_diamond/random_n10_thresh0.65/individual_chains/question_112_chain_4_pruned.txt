Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the coefficients are complex numbers, and the probabilities depend on their magnitudes squared. Normalizing will give me the actual probabilities.

Wait, but the question mentions an operator whose matrix elements Aij are hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, what's an operator like that? Oh, right, the Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli matrices have off-diagonal elements as 1, but maybe scaled here. Oh, but in this case, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero (since Aij is 0 when i=j, right?), and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

But wait, I might be getting this wrong. Because the problem says Aij is hbar/2 when i≠j. So for a 2x2 matrix, i and j can be 1 and 2. So the matrix would be:

Row 1: [0, hbar/2]

Row 2: [hbar/2, 0]

Yes, that's correct. So this operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, since Pauli X has [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (hbar/2) * σx.

But why is the operator given? The question is to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of this operator. So when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections onto the corresponding eigenvectors.

But wait, the state is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z, the spin-z component operator. The |up> and |down> states correspond to the eigenstates of σ_z, which are diagonal in the computational basis.

But the operator A is proportional to σ_x, so its eigenstates are different. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So, to find the probabilities, I need to express the state |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A. Alternatively, compute the projections of |alpha> onto each eigenvector of A, square their magnitudes, and those would be the probabilities. Then the average value is the expectation value of A in the state |alpha>.

Wait, but first, let me make sure I have |alpha> correctly. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So I need to normalize this.

Calculating the normalization factor. The state vector is a 2-component vector. Each component is a complex number. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component.

So the first component is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 =
