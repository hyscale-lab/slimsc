Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by understanding the question.

The question is about which stars can be observed with both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Both are high-resolution spectrographs, so I'm guessing they have different capabilities in terms of brightness they can detect.

Looking at the given info: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So, the brighter the star (lower magnitude number), the easier it is to detect.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's written: "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Since magnitude is a scale where lower numbers are brighter, I think that means ESPRESSO can go down to 17, meaning it can see stars as faint as 17 V mag. Similarly, HIRES can see down to 16. So, anything brighter (lower magnitude) than 17 can be seen by both, but HIRES can see a bit brighter, down to 16. So, a star that is brighter than 16 can be seen by both, right? Because if a star is 15 mag, both can see it. If it's, say, 17 mag, only ESPRESSO can see it. But if it's 16.5, then ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't? Wait, let me think again. The text says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So, brightness is higher when the magnitude is lower. So, a star with V mag 16 is brighter than 17, so both can see it. But a star with V mag 16.5 is still brighter than 17? No, higher magnitude means fainter. Wait, no. Wait, the apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So, a star with V mag 16 is brighter than a star with V mag 17.

So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 (so V <17) can be observed. HIRES can observe stars with V <16. So, stars with V mag less than 16 can be observed by both. Because if a star's V mag is 15, both can see
