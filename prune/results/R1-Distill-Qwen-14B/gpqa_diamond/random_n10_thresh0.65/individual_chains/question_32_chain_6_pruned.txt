Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium isotope is Li-7, I think. Because Li has 3 protons normally, and 3 neutrons would make Li-6? Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Average lithium is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. But the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so that would be Li-6. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Li has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that's 3+3=6, so Li-6? Or maybe the problem uses a different notation. Maybe it's considering X as a nucleus with atomic number equal to Li, so Z=3, and N=3, so mass number A=6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6. The question is about the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. So we're looking for the total energy of the nucleus, which in particle physics terms is the relativistic energy.

I remember that the total energy E of a moving particle is given by the equation E = gamma * m_0 c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). So first, I need to calculate gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me compute gamma. Let's plug v=0.96c into the formula. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is... let me calculate that. 0.0784 is 784e-4. Square root of 784 is 28, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28,
