Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has this really rigid structure, like a diamondoid, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms attached to adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. 

The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C, which forms a light yellow solid, product 1. The product's NMR and IR data are given. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, that makes me think that a ketone is formed because KOH is a strong base, and heating with it might lead to an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines. When KOH is used, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it could form a diene. But wait, the IR suggests a carbonyl, not a double bond. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe it's a double elimination, leading to a diketone? Or perhaps an epoxide? No, epoxide would have an ether peak in IR, around 1100-1250 cm-1, but the given IR is 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: when you have two bromine atoms adjacent on adamantane, and you treat with KOH, perhaps it's a double E2 elimination. Because each Br is on adjacent carbons, eliminating both would form a double bond. But wait, with two Brs, maybe it forms a bridge or introduces a ring with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe each elimination forms a ketone if it's a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, no, wait. Vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) when treated with a strong base like KOH can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, removing two HX molecules (like HBr here) and forming a double bond. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it might lose two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. But that would give me an alkene, not a carbonyl. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, could it be that the structure
