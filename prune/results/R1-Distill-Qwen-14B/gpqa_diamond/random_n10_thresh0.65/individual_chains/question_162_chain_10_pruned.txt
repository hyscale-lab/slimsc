Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that denominator looks a lot like 4 - (x² + y²), so the condition for the metric to be real is that 4 - x² - y² > 0. So the domain where this metric is defined is x² + y² < 4, which would be a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Oh, right, because the radius is 2 here. So the radius r is 2 as given.

Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, what's the area of a pseudosphere? I think in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (or pseudosphere) of radius r is... wait, in Euclidean geometry, a sphere's surface area is 4πr², but for hyperbolic, I think the formula is different. Or wait, no—maybe it's related to the Gaussian curvature.

Wait, pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The Gaussian curvature K is negative. The formula for the area of a pseudosphere of radius r (which is the radius in terms of the curvature, I think) is... I'm trying to recall. Wait, maybe the area would be infinite? Because hyperbolic surfaces can have infinite area even if they're compact
