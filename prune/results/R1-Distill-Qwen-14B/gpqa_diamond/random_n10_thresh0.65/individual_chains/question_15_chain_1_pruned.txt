Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and then think about what each part means.

The question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, which have been detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The researchers want to observe which one is more likely to transit because they have limited time. The goal is to pick the planet with the higher probability of transiting.

Hmm, wait, what's a transit? Oh right, that's when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the planet's orbit and the size of the star, I think.

The planets have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter period means it's orbiting faster and closer in (since orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's laws). 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not larger in radius. That might affect the transit probability because the size of the star determines how likely the planet's path will cross our line of sight.

Wait, transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so that simplifies to P = (R_star / a_planet). Because sqrt(1) is 1. So basically, P is proportional to R_star divided by the planet's orbital distance (a). 

Wait, no. Wait, actually, I think I might have that wrong. Let me think. The formula for the transit probability is a bit more involved. It's approximately P = (R_star / a_planet), but actually, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) but since e=0, it's just (R_star / a_planet). 

No, wait, I'm not sure. I think the transit probability is given by the formula: P ≈ (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + m_planet/m_star)^0.5), but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, that term is approximately 1. So maybe it's just (R_* / a), but also considering the star's size relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, another thought: the probability that a planet transits is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is roughly (R_*/a), considering the size of the star relative to the orbit. So if R_* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis (distance), then the chance of the planet passing in front is higher when a is smaller. Because a smaller a makes the transit more probable—if the planet is closer, the chance it blocks the star is higher.

But wait, also, the orientation of the orbit matters. The RV method tells us the minimum mass because
