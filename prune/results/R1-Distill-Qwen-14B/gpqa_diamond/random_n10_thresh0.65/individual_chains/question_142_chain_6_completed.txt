Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Alright, let me try to unpack this.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. So, this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

Wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit? Oh right, a qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. For a pure state |ψ><ψ|, the density matrix is a projector. But this ρ isn't that because it's a sum of |0><0| and |1><1|, each multiplied by 1/2. So it's a mixed state, specifically a maximally mixed state because the eigenvalues are both 1/2.

But the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm. I'm a bit confused about how the density matrix relates to position in space. Oh wait, I think qubit states are often visualized on the Bloch sphere. So maybe this density matrix corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, the vector on the Bloch sphere is (x, y, z), where the components are related to the amplitudes of the qubit state. But for density matrices, especially for mixed states, the representation might be different.

Wait, I remember that any density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector. Let me think. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector with components (x, y, z). So r is the Bloch vector. If ρ is diagonal and the off-diagonal terms are zero, then the y-component might be zero, but I'm not entirely sure.

Let's compute the given ρ. So ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write out the matrix. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2.

Wait, the identity matrix is I. So ρ = (I)/2. Now, using the general expression ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set them equal: (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + r·σ)/2 = (I)/2 implies that r·σ = 0 matrix.

What's r·σ? σ is the vector of Pauli matrices: σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. So for this to be zero, each component must satisfy r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z =0. Because each Pauli matrix is non-zero and they are linearly independent. So the only solution is r = (0,0,0).

Ah, so the Bloch vector r is at the origin. So in the Bloch sphere, the point is (0,0,0). But wait, the Bloch sphere's surface is for pure states, with r having length 1. So a point at the origin would represent a completely mixed state. That makes sense because ρ here is maximally mixed.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which I think is the state |0> on the Bloch sphere, but ρ here isn't a pure state. So the correct position should be the origin.

Thus, the answer must be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, as it is an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), with eigenvalues \(1/2\) and \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) is the vector of Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that the off-diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are zero, and the diagonal terms correspond to \(\frac{I}{2}\). This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), meaning the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero. Therefore, the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the point \((0, 0, 0)\).

Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin of the Bloch sphere.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** Correct, as this represents the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
