Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least h-bar over 2. So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE multiplied by the lifetime τ is greater than or equal to ħ/2.

But wait, the lifetime here is given as τ. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be roughly ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So for the first state with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 is ħ/(1e-9). Similarly, τ2=1e-8, so ΔE2 is ħ/(1e-8). But how does that help us?

Oh, I think the idea is that to resolve two energy levels, their energy separation ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Wait, no. Each state has its own uncertainty. So perhaps the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is much larger than either uncertainty, then they can be distinguished.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Or wait, maybe to resolve them, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy of the system when the state is measured. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the natural linewidth. The natural linewidth comes from the uncertainty principle. The broader the linewidth (longer lifetime), the smaller the energy uncertainty. So if two states have energy differences much larger than their uncertainties, they will appear as separate peaks.

So the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each. Wait, but each has a different uncertainty. So perhaps ΔE needs to be greater than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Let me compute the uncertainties.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But in eV·s, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 eV·s is 1.602e-19 J·s. So ħ ≈ 6
