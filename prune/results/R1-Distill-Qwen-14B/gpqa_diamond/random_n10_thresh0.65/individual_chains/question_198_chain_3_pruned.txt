Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. And the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Wait, I need to clarify what the complexes are. The stability constants β1 to β4 correspond to different complexes. Typically, for metal ions like Co(II), they form complexes by binding thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The complexes would be Co(SCN)_n where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So each β is the formation constant for that specific complex. So β1 is for CoSCN^2+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^2+, etc.

The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, what's the structure? Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- groups attached. So for Co(II), the dithiocyanato complexes are Co(SCN)2^2+. But wait, I think there are different isomeric forms for n=2 and higher. Oh, but maybe that doesn't matter here, since the problem is about the concentration of the complexes.

Wait, I remember that the stability constant (β) increases with the number of ligand attachments, but sometimes it can decrease if the higher complexes are less stable. Looking at the β values: β1=9, β2=40 (so higher, more stable), β3=63 (even higher), β4=16 (which is lower than β3). So the most stable complex is the trithiocyanato, Co(SCN)_3^2+? Hmm. But the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which would include both Co(SCN)_2^2+ and any other forms, but I think here they're referring to the specific complex which is blue.

Wait, maybe the color is due to the specific complex formed. So the blue one is a particular dithiocyanato complex. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering all species up to n=4 and determining the percentage of the dithiocyan
