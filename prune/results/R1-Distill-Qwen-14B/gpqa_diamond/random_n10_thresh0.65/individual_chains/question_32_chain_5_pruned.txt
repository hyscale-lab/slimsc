Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, right? The question is about finding the energy of the collider so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li with 3 neutrons would be lithium-6 because Li typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6.

So the first thing I think is I need to find the energy of the ion. Since it's a relativistic problem, I should probably use the relativistic equations, maybe the energy-momentum relation or something involving gamma.

Wait, the nucleus is moving at 0.96c. So its speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that when something is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, you can't use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v²/c²). Right, so I can calculate gamma with v = 0.96c.

Let me compute gamma first. So v is 0.96c. Let's plug that into the formula:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v² is (0.96c)^2, so v²/c² is (
