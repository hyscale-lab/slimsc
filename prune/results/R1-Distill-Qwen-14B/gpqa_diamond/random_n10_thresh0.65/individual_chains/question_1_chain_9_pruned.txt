Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about energy levels and their lifetimes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember something about the energy-time uncertainty principle. Oh right! It's ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the product of the uncertainty in energy and the time should be around ħ. But wait, how does that relate to the lifetime here?

Oh, right! The lifetime of a state is like the time interval over which the state exists, or the time it takes for the state to decay. So the uncertainty in time Δt would be related to the lifetime. But wait, in the uncertainty principle, Δt is the time during which the system is observed, right? Or is it the standard deviation of the lifetime? I'm a bit confused, but I think for this problem, the approach is to use the uncertainty principle with the lifetimes of the states.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So maybe we should consider the energy difference and the uncertainty in time for each state. Wait, but the problem is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, then you can't tell them apart.

So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime of the state. Let me write that down. For E1, ΔE
