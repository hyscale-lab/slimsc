Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me read it carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction involves another compound reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form a carboxylic acid. The options are A to D, with different combinations for A and B.

I think I should break this down step by step. Let's start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's acetone. The reaction is with NaCN and A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one has a carbonyl group on the second carbon. The product has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So, the product is something like (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would be: CN-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons. Oh wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. So in the presence of an acid or without? I remember that when ketones react with CN- under certain conditions, they add a cyanide group. But sometimes, that's via a two-step process. For example, in the presence of a strong acid, the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making it a better electrophile. Then CN- attacks, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. But wait, the product here has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. Oh wait, that's a possible example of a hydroxy group being added alongside the cyanide?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the cyanide attacking the carbonyl, forming an addition product. But then, for the product
