Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances usually refer to particles that are unstable and decay quickly. The question is about the mean decay distance, also known as the decay length. Hmm, right, decay length is how far a particle travels before it decays.

The given data are:
- Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV
- Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Width, Γ_X = 320 MeV

And the options are four different distances in meters. So I need to calculate the mean decay distance using these values.

I think the formula for the mean decay distance involves the particle's lifetime, its speed, and perhaps some other factors. Let me recall the formula. Oh right, the mean decay distance (L) is given by L = c * τ * beta * gamma, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, beta is v/c, and gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but how do I get τ? Oh, right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I should make sure about the units here.

Let me jot down the steps I need to take:
1. Calculate the mean lifetime τ using the width Γ.
2. Calculate the Lorentz gamma factor for the meson.
3. Find beta (v/c). Since gamma depends on beta, maybe I can find beta from gamma.
4. Combine all these to find the decay distance.

First, step 1: τ = ħ / Γ. Let me make sure about the units. ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) *1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 goes into 6 about 18 times (0.32*18=5.76), remainder 0.84. 0.84 / 0.32 is 2.625. So total is 18 + 2.625 = 20.625. So 20.625e-25 s, which is 2.0625e-24 s. So τ ≈ 2.0625
