Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and other factors. But wait, this is relativistic, right? So I guess I can't just use the simple formula from the classical case; I need to consider how relativity affects things.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But since we're dealing with relativity, the kinetic energy expression must be different from the classical case. Oh right, in relativity, kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² but something involving gamma.

Wait, let me think. The total energy in relativity for a particle is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But for the oscillator, the total mechanical energy at maximum displacement (x=A) would be all potential, right? Because at maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential.

So at x = A, the potential energy U is (1/2)kA². The total energy E should be equal to that, because the kinetic energy K is zero there. But wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc². Wait, no, gamma mc² is the total energy when the particle is at rest, but when it's moving, the total energy is gamma mc², which includes
