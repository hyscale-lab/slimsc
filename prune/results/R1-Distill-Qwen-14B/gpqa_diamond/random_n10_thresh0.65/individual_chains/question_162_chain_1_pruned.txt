Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is like a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But what's the metric telling me?

I remember that in differential geometry, the metric tensor tells us about the distances and angles in the space. The area element in 2D is usually something like sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. So I need to compute the determinant of the metric here.

The metric is written in terms of dx² + dy² multiplied by a factor. Let's see, the given metric is diagonal, meaning the off-diagonal terms (like dx dy) are zero. So the metric tensor g_ij is diagonal. The components would be:

g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_xy = 0, etc.

So the determinant g would be the product of the diagonal terms since it's diagonal. So determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Wait, or wait, no. The determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal elements. So in two dimensions, if the metric is g_{11} dx² + g_{22} dy², then determinant is g_{11} * g_{22}. Since both g_{11} and g_{22} are same here, it'd be (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

So the area element dA would be sqrt(g) dx dy. But wait, g is the determinant, which is already positive here, so sqrt(g) would be sqrt[(32)^2 / (4 - (x² + y²))^2] = 32/(4 - (x² + y²)).

Wait, because sqrt(a²) is a, assuming a is positive. So 32 is positive, and the denominator is positive? Let me check. The denominator is 4 minus x² minus y², so as long as x² + y² <4, that's positive. But if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the area element blow up. So this suggests that the space is only defined where x² + y² <4, like a disk of radius 2.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, I thought pseudosphere has a specific area. Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere (which is actually a surface of revolution of a tractrix) should have a finite area. Oh wait, no, wait. Or is it that the pseudosphere has infinite area? Wait, no, I think the standard pseudosphere has finite area. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total area by integrating dA over the entire domain. The domain where the metric is defined is the region where 4 - x² - y² >0, so
