Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me think. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. They're in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies.

Wait, what's LTE mean again? Oh right, it's when the gas is in thermal equilibrium with a local radiation field, so the Saha equation and Boltzmann distribution apply. So the excitation of energy levels is determined by the temperature.

I remember the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann const, T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference Î”E is given as 1.38e-23 J. So E_i - E_j is that value. The problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, so n1/n2 = 2? Or wait, the ratio is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. Let me see the question again: iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the number of atoms in that excited state is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2 for the same level.

Wait, no. Wait, the statement says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe it's the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms that's twice as much for star_1. But perhaps I should model it as (n_upper / n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper / n_lower)_2.

Wait, let's clarify. Let me denote for each star, the ratio of atoms in the upper energy level to the lower as R1 and R2. So R1 = (n_upper1 / n_lower1) and R2 = (n_upper2 / n_lower2). The question says R1 = 2 * R2.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the specific energy level is the upper or lower one. Hmm, maybe it's a ratio between two specific levels, so the ratio of
