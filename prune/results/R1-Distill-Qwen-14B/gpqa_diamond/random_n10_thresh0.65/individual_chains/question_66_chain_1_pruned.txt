Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, SMEFT is an effective theory framework that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. I remember that the SMEFT is constructed by including all possible terms that are consistent with the gauge symmetries and other underlying symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. The Standard Model, and hence SMEFT, must respect Lorentz symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. All interactions and operators must be invariant under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's the full symmetry of special relativity. But wait, in effective field theories, things can get a bit tricky. I think SMEFT is usually considered in a fixed spacetime background, so maybe the full Poincare symmetry isn't strictly required because the theory is formulated in a background where translations are already accounted for. Or do the operators themselves have to respect Poincare? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think: Poincare includes translations, so the theory should respect that. But in SMEFT, which includes higher-dimensional operators, maybe the operators don't need to be invariant under translations because the background handles that. Or wait, no, the operators in the effective theory should still be built from fields that transform correctly under Poincare. Or perhaps, since SMEFT is built from local terms, the individual operators might not need to be invariant under translations because the theory as a whole is. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this one. I'll come back to it.

Then CP symmetry. CP is Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators can have terms that violate CP as well. So not all operators have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP symmetry, is not a must. Therefore, any answer that includes 3 wouldn't be correct.

CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The Standard Model, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, respects CPT symmetry. Because the SM is a relativistic theory, any operator in the effective theory must respect CPT. So CPT symmetry (option 4) must be respected by all operators.

So reviewing the options: which symmetries must be respected. Lorentz (1) must be, CPT (4) must be. What about Poincare (2)? Well, since Lorentz is part of Poincare, but Poincare involves translations. In the SMEFT, I think the operators are local, so they involve derivatives and fields, but each term in the Lagrangian must transform correctly under Poincare. Wait, but operators are built from fields that are Poincare objects. So perhaps all terms must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but wait: in SMEFT, the interactions are written in a way that respects the gauge symmetries and Lorentz symmetry. But do they have
