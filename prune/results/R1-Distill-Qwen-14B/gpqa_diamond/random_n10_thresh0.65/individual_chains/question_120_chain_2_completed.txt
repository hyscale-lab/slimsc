Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is plx in arcseconds = 1 / distance in parsecs. So the closer the star, the larger the parallax.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Like, the same number of stars per volume? Or maybe per some other measure. So if the distribution is uniform in space, then the number density is constant. I think that's the assumption here—stars are evenly spread out in space.

Now, the problem is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (n) changes with plx. So we're looking for n as a function of plx.

Let me think about the relationship between distance and parallax. Since plx = 1/distance (d), so d = 1/plx. So when plx increases, distance decreases. Like, a star with a larger plx is closer.

But how does the number of stars in a certain plx range depend on plx? Let's consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by the thickness. The surface area is 4πd², so volume is 4πd² dd.

But wait, the number of stars in this shell depends on the number density of stars (n_0) multiplied by the volume. So number of stars N = n_0 * 4πd² dd.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. So N = n_0 * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d d). Wait, but wait, dd is the change in distance. Since plx is 1/d, then d plx would relate to d d. Let me think: d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² d plx. Oh, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for our purposes, we can take the absolute value.

So, substituting d = 1/plx into dd = (1/plx)^2 d plx. So N = n_0 *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d plx. Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that.

Wait, the shell's thickness is dd, which is the change in distance. So to find how many stars are in a range of plx, I should express the shell's volume in terms of plx.

So, let me start over. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = n_0 * 4π d² dd.

But since we're interested in the number per unit parallax, let's express N in terms of plx. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

So, N = n_0 * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But how is dd related to d plx? Let's compute it. Since d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. The negative just shows that as plx increases, d decreases, but for the number, we can consider the magnitude, so dd = (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, no, let me think again. Let's take the derivative of d with respect to plx.

d = 1/plx → dd/d plx = -1/(plx)^2 → dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx.

But since we are considering a small change in plx, d plx could be positive or negative. But for the purpose of counting stars, I think we can consider the absolute value. So, the change in distance dd is (1/plx²) * d plx.

But wait, when plx increases by d plx, the distance decreases. So, let's say plx increases by Δplx, then distance decreases by Δd = - (Δplx)/(plx²).

But perhaps for the purposes of the number, we can just take the magnitude. So, substituting dd into N:

N = n_0 * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx^2) d plx )

Wait, that would make N proportional to (1/plx^4) d plx. So, the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is N/(d plx) = n_0 * 4π (1/plx^4).

So, the number of stars per unit range of plx (i.e., per d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)", which I think is N/(d plx). So that would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which would be the case. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can have different dependencies.

Wait another approach: Let me think about the volume element in terms of parallax.

Alternatively, the differential volume in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. To express this in terms of plx, we have d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, the volume element in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx → 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Since the number of stars is proportional to volume, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: Think about the number density. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant, say n_0.

The number of stars per unit volume is n_0. The volume element in terms of plx is dV = 4π (d)^2 dd → plugging d=1/plx, so dV =4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d plx = 4π/(plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars is n_0 * dV = n_0 * 4π/(plx^4) d plx.

Thus, the number per unit plx is (n_0 *4π)/(plx^4). So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by analyzing the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is defined as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star in parsecs. This means that as \( \text{plx} \) increases, the distance \( d \) decreases.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell and the number density of stars \( n_0 \). The volume of the shell is given by \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 dd.
\]

To express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we note that \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), so:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting this into the volume expression, we get:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( n_0 \cdot dV \), so:

\[
N = n_0 \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per \( d\text{plx} \)) is therefore:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = n_0 \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
