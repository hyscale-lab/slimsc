Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the blue dithiocyanato complex? I think blue refers to the [Co(SCN)_n]^3- or something like that. Oh right, I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is a blue complex. So dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ligands? Wait, no, wait. Dithiocyanato would have two SCN- ligands. Or maybe more? Wait, [Co(SCN)_2]^2- is something else. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh, wait, the stability constants are given up to β4, which would be the number of ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN], β2 for [Co(SCN)2], up to β4 for [Co(SCN)4], I think.

So the question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Hmm, which complex is the blue one. Wait, from what I recall, [Co(SCN)4]^3- is the blue complex, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be [Co(SCN)2]^2- that's blue. I might need to figure that out.

Wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN- groups. So maybe the complex is [Co(SCN)2]^2+? But I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be [Co(SCN)_n]^3- where n is 4, but that's tet
