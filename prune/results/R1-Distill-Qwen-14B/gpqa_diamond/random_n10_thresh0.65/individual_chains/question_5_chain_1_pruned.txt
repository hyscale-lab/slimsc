Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So I think the operator P is a vector operator, and when they say the operator is along direction n, which is in the x-z plane, I need to construct the operator in that direction and then find its eigenvector.

Hmm, right. The operator P along an arbitrary direction n can be written as the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n is zero. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by ħ/2. Because each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. Let me write out each component's matrix first.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when I combine them with direction n=(n_x,0,n_z), the operator becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices. Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Right.

So the operator P is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). I need to find an eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But wait, the eigenvalue equation would be (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (1) |ψ>, because P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), so when you set P |ψ
