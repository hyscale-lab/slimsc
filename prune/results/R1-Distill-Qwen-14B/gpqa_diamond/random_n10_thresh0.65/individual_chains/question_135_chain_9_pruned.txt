Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think maybe I got the LaTeX wrong. Let me parse that again. Oh right, it's probably L(y) = -λ ψ_f^† (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y), where ψ_f is the fermion field. Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Oh wait, the correct Lagrangian would involve the fermion fields, probably something like ψ_f^† X ψ_f, but I might not need to get into the details of the interaction term for solving this problem. 

The key point is about the decay of the boson X. So X is a boson with a mass of 6 GeV. The question is asking what are the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order.

So first, I need to think about what particles can be decay products. Because X is a boson, its decay products must consist of particles that the boson can couple to. From the Lagrangian, it looks like X couples to fermions. Let me see, the interaction term is -λ f ψ_f^† X ψ_f, which suggests that X interacts with fermions in the same way as a Yukawa coupling. So X can decay into a pair of fermions ff̄.

Wait, but what fermions are available? The fermion fields ψ_f would include all the known fermions, but the decay must conserve charge and have the right quantum numbers. Also, kinematically, the rest mass of the fermions must be less than half the mass of X, because for a decay into two particles, each must have mass less than or equal to X's mass/2. So if X is 6 GeV, each fermion must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. But wait, let's think about the actual masses of the fermions.

The fermions in the Standard Model are: up quarks (u), down quarks (d), charm (c), strange (s), top (t), bottom (b), and the leptons like e, mu, tau, and the neutrinos. But wait, top quarks are way too heavy—mass around 173 GeV. So they can't be decay products of X (6 GeV), so X can't decay into t t̄.

Similarly, the bottom quark has a mass of about 4.7 GeV. Wait, wait, no, wait—wait, the bottom quark mass is approximately 4.7 GeV. But X is 6 GeV. So for a decay into b b̄, each b would have a mass of about 4.7 GeV. The sum is about 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So that's impossible. So X can't decay into b b̄. So any option that includes b b̄ is incorrect. Looking at the options:

Option A includes b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, e+ e−.

But wait, the tau lepton is about 1.77 GeV. So tau pair would be 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So 3.54 <6, so that's allowed. But wait, what about the quarks?

Wait, what's the mass of the up quark? It's about 2 MeV, so negligible. Down quark is about 4-5 MeV. So for X to decay into u ū, each u is 2 MeV, so total 4 MeV, way below 6 GeV. Same for d d̄. So that's allowed.

Charm quark mass is about 1.5 GeV. So c c̄ would have a mass of 3 GeV. So 3 GeV is equal to X's mass / 2 (since 6 GeV/2=3 GeV). So that's allowed. So c c̄ would be allowed.

Similarly, strange quark mass is about 100 MeV or so? Wait, no, strange quark mass is around 100 MeV? Or maybe 500 MeV? Wait, I think the average is about 100 MeV for u and d, a bit higher for s. Wait, perhaps I should look up the masses, but I'm just trying to think this through.

Wait, the up quark is about 2.2 MeV, down about 4.7 MeV. Strange is about 95 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom about 4.7 GeV, top 173 GeV. So for X (6 GeV) to decay into s s̄: each s is about 0.095 GeV, so 2 * 0.095 is 0.19 GeV, which is way below 6 GeV. So allowed.

But wait, can X decay into s s̄? Yes, but the mass isn't the issue—what about the coupling? Because X couples to all fermions, but the coupling strength might vary, but the question is about kinematical (mass) constraints, not about the actual decay rate or coupling strength. So any fermion pair where each is less than 3 GeV (since X is 6 GeV) is allowed.

Wait, but wait—let me think about the decay into e+ e−.
