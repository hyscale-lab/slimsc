Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium, as observed in the laboratory. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D, and the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm, alright. So, first, I remember that when a medium is moving relative to an observer, the speed of light within that medium might be affected by the motion. But wait, isn't the speed of light in a vacuum always c according to special relativity? But the glass is moving, so maybe the speed isn't the same as in the rest frame of the glass.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer. Wait, no, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam in the glass is moving in that same direction as well. So from the lab frame, the beam's direction is the same as the glass's movement.

I think the key here is to consider how the velocity of the light in the glass transforms when the glass is moving. The glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So maybe we should apply a velocity transformation, like the relativistic velocity addition formula?

Wait, but light's speed is tricky because in any inertial frame, light must travel at c. Wait, but that's in a vacuum. What about in a moving medium? Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light beam is moving at velocity v_light, which is c/n, because the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index. Wait, yeah, because the refractive index n is c divided by the phase velocity in the medium. So v_light_rest_frame = c/n.

Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, we need to find the velocity of the light. But wait, relativity says that the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, but here the light is in a medium that's moving. So perhaps the velocity addition formula from special relativity applies here.

Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, that's when you have a velocity u in the lab frame, and the frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. But wait, in this case, the light's velocity in the glass's frame is u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So when you transform to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v towards the observer), what's the transformed velocity?

Wait, no. Let me think about the direction. If the glass is moving towards the observer (the lab frame), then in the lab frame, the glass's speed is v. The light in the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So in the glass's rest frame (S'), the light's velocity is u' = c/n towards the same direction as the glass's motion. So we want to find the velocity u in the lab frame (S), which is moving at velocity v with respect to S'.

So applying the relativistic velocity addition formula, u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' * v)/c²]. Because the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, but wait, no. Wait, the lab is S, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light in the lab. So the glass's frame is S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S (the lab). So, the light's velocity in S' is u' = v_light_rest_frame = c/n, direction same as v.

So in the lab frame S, the velocity u would be [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/c²].

Plugging in u' = c/n and c=1:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / (1)^2 )

But c=1, so u becomes ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Hmm, perhaps factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1 + n v ) / n

Denominator: (n + v ) / n

So when you divide them, the n cancels out:

( (1 + n v) / n ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

So the speed of light in the lab frame is (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, but wait: is this the speed of the light relative to the lab? Because that's what we're being asked.

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Option B is 1. Hmm, but wait, in a vacuum, the speed is always c, but here it's in a medium moving. So according to this, the speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v ). But wait, let's think about units. If n is a dimensionless quantity, then (n v) is (unitless times velocity). Wait, but I'm assuming here that v is in units where c=1, so v is a fraction of c. So n v would be a product of a number (n) and a fraction of c.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v / c² )

In the glass frame, the light's speed is u' = c/n. Since c=1, u' = 1/n.

So substituting, u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Which simplifies to (1 + n v ) / (n + v ), because:

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n*(1) + v * n = n + v n ?

Wait, denominator after multiplying by n:

[1 * n + v * n * (1/n) ) ]?

Hmm, perhaps I'll do the math again. Let me compute it step by step.

u = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (1/n) v ]

Let me factor this:

Numerator: (1 + n v) / n

Denominator: [ (n + v) / n ]

So u becomes [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ) ] = (1 +n v) / (n + v )

So the speed is (1 + n v) / (n + v ), which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options. Option A is (1 +n v)/(n + v ). Yes.

But wait, what if the glass is moving away from the observer? No, the question says the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer. So that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: the speed shouldn't exceed c. Let's test for some numbers. Suppose n=1 and v is a fraction of c, say v=0.5c. Then the speed would be (1 +1*0.5)/(1 +0.5 ) = 1.5 /1.5 =1. But c is 1, so that's okay. If v is 0, then speed is 1/n, which is correct for a stationary medium.

Another test: if v is negative, meaning the glass is moving in the opposite direction. Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving towards the observer, so v is positive in the same direction as the light.

Wait, but what if n is 3 and v is 0.5? Then the speed would be (1 +3*0.5)/(3 +0.5 ) = (1 +1.5)/(3.5 )= 2.5 /3.5= 5/7 ≈0.714. That's less than c=1, which makes sense.

So, according to this, the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in a glass medium relative to a laboratory frame where the glass is moving at velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass and \( c = 1 \) (speed of light in a vacuum). 

The relativistic velocity addition formula is given by:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory frame is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to option A.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived result and is correct.
- **Option B**: \( 1 \) is incorrect because it assumes the speed of light is always \( c \), which is only true in a vacuum, not in a moving medium.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) is incorrect because the denominator does not match the relativistic velocity addition formula.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) is incorrect because the numerator does not match the derived result.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
