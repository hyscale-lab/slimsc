Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

So the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, meaning we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same masses, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital periodâ€”three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right?

Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations. The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. Oh, but both stars have the same radii. Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, but same size as Planet_1's host. So, same radius but different masses. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula I think is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (some function involving the orbital inclination, but since we don't know that, I guess the probability is based on the geometric likelihood). Oh wait, the probability that a planet transits is approximately the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but wait, no, that's for the depth of the transit. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, from our point of view, aligns so that it passes directly in front of the star. The formula I recall is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (something like 1 / (e + something)), but wait, for circular orbits (e=0), it's just P = R_star / a_planet. No, wait, that's the depth, not the probability. Hmm, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, but I'm confused now.

Wait, no, the geometric probability of a transit is given by (R_star / a_planet) * ( (1 + (R_planet / R_star)^2 )^(1/2) ) )? Or something like that. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think.

No, wait, I think the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_star /
