Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and at a distance l from the cavity's center. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions for E.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields. When a conductor is neutral, any enclosed charge will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Since the conductor itself was uncharged, the inner cavity's charge +q will induce an equal amount of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Then, to balance, the outer surface will have +q, because the conductor was initially neutral.

Wait, no wait. If the conductor is initially uncharged, placing a charge +q inside the cavity will cause the inner surface to have -q (by induction) and the outer surface will have +q, making the total charge of the conductor zero. Because the conductor's original charge was zero, the outer surface must have +q to balance the -q on the inner surface plus the +q inside.

So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor (point P), it should be as if all the charge is concentrated at the center, right? Because for a conductor's outer surface, the field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed, due to the shell theorem. So the field outside would be the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor's own charges are at the outer surface, so the field outside depends on the total charge. But in this case, the conductor's total charge is zero plus the +q from the cavity, so it's +q. So the field outside should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, with the angle theta between l and s. So the position of P relative to the cavity's center is important. Oh, but because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetric. So the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed by the conductor, which is +q. So the field at P would be the same as if the charge q were at the center of the conductor.

So the electric field E at point P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², right? Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but why are the other options there? Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared in the denominator. That seems like it's considering some sort of displacement between the point P and the charge's position, but that's probably not relevant because the charge's effect is screened except for the outer conductor's induced charge. Similarly, option C has (l + s cosθ), which doesn't make sense either. Option D is based on l, but the field outside depends on L, not l, because the conductor's field is determined by the total charge and the distance from its center.

So I think option B is the correct one.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal amount of negative charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. The total charge of the conductor remains zero, so the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. In this case, the total charge on the conductor is $+q$, which resides on the outer surface. By the shell theorem, the field outside the conductor is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Field Calculation**: The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Since the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of Other Options**: 
   - Option A involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which incorrectly suggests a dependence on the geometry of the cavity and the point $P$ relative to the cavity's center. This is irrelevant because the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge and the distance from the conductor's center.
   - Option C uses $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is similarly incorrect for the same reason.
   - Option D uses $l^2$, which incorrectly bases the field on the distance from the cavity's center rather than the conductor's center.

Thus, the correct answer is based on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.

**Answer: B**
