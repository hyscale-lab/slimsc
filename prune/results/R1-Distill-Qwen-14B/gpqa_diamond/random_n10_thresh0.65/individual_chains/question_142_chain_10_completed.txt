Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's positioned in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through carefully.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a maximally mixed state. Maxamally mixed states are like the completely randomized state, right? For a single qubit, the maximally mixed state is the one where the qubit is in a completely uncertain state, like being in a superposition of both |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probability, but without any coherence.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, a maximally mixed state is different from a maximally entangled state. Wait, no—density matrices for mixed states are different from pure states. So, the density matrix for a pure state like |ψ⟩⟨ψ| would have trace squared equal to 1, but for a mixed state, it's less than 1. But this one has ρ = ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute the trace of this matrix. The trace is ½*(1 + 1) = 1, which makes sense because all density matrices must have trace 1.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I'm recalling that for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize all possible states of a qubit. So, the state |0⟩ is at the north pole (0,0,1), and |1⟩ is at the south pole (0,0,-1). But wait, wait, no. Wait, the Bloch vector for a qubit state |θ, φ⟩ is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), right? So for |0⟩, θ is 0, so cosθ is 1, so the z-coordinate is 1, and x and y are 0. So |0⟩ is (0,0,1). Similarly, |1⟩ is (0,0,-1), because θ is π, so cosθ is -1.

But the given ρ isn't a pure state. So how does the Bloch sphere representation work for mixed states? Oh right, for density matrices, the state can be represented as a vector in the Bloch sphere as well, but it's scaled. The formula is that the density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (like the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So, solving for r, we get r = 2(ρ - I/2). Because ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, so rearranging gives r·σ = 2ρ - I.

So let's compute that. The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0, and |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (1/2) I. So ρ is (I)/2.

So plugging into the formula for r: r = 2( (I/2) ) - I. Let's compute that. 2*(I/2) is I, so I - I is zero. So r is (0, 0, 0). That means the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. So the geometrical position r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The maximally mixed state has no preferred direction because it's equally likely to be in |0⟩ or |1⟩, so the Bloch vector should indeed be at the center of the sphere. Yep, that makes sense. So yes, option C is correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) of a density matrix \( \rho \) is related to \( \rho \) by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Rearranging this, we find:

\[
\mathbf{r} = 2(\rho - I/2).
\]

Substituting \( \rho = \frac{1}{2}I \) into the equation:

\[
\mathbf{r} = 2\left( \frac{1}{2}I - \frac{1}{2}I \right) = 2(0) = (0, 0, 0).
\]

Thus, the density matrix \( \rho \) corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This makes sense because the maximally mixed state has no preferred direction and is equally likely to be in \( \left|0\right\rangle \) or \( \left|1\right\rangle \), so it lies at the center of the Bloch sphere.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).**

Answer: C
