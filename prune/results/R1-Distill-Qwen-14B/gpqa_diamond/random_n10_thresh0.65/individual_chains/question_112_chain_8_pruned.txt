Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

So, the problem says we have a state |alpha> that's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I think that means |alpha> is a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states. First, I probably need to normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional, which implies it's not necessarily normalized yet.

Wait, right. The state is given as proportional, so I should find the normalization factor. The normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients equals 1.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me calculate their magnitudes. The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). The magnitude of (2-i) is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5). So the total squared magnitude is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no, the state is |alpha> = a(1+i)|up> + a(2-i)|down>, where a is the proportionality constant. Because it says the state is proportional to that expression. So the actual state is a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2-i)|down>. So the normalization is |a|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2-i
