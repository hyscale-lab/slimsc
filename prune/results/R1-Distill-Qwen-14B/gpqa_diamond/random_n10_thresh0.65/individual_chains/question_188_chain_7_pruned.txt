Alright, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Okay, the question says the crystal has an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember there's a formula for that using the Miller indices (hkl) and the lattice parameters.

Hmm, the formula for interplanar distance d is given by 1/d² equals the sum of (h², k², l²) multiplied by certain terms from the lattice constants and angles. But wait, the exact formula is a bit hazy. Let me recall.

Right, for a general rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is defined by a single parameter 'a' (since all edges are equal in a rhombohedral system) and the angles between the edges, which are all the same here (alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees). So a rhombohedral system is a special case where the three vectors are equal in length but the angles between them are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees.

The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is: 

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cos beta)/(a²) - (2 hl cos gamma)/(a²) - (2 kl cos alpha)/(a²)

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Another approach: maybe the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by:

d = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)) / (h² + k² + l²) ]^(1/2) / (h² +k² + l²)^(1/2)

Wait, that might be mixing things up. Maybe I should look for the formula specific to a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another thought: in a cubic system, the formula is straightforward, but in a rhombohedral, it's more complicated because of the angles. Oh wait, but in this case all the angles are equal. So maybe there's a simplified
