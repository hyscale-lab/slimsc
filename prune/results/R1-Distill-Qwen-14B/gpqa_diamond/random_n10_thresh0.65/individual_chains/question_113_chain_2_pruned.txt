Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I need to analyze each of the spectroscopy results and see what they tell me about the compound's structure.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum: The key peaks mentioned are a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹, and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 

The broad peak around 3000 is likely an -OH group. Oh wait, but wait: in FTIR, a broad peak around 3000-3500 usually indicates O-H stretching. But wait, wait a second—broad peaks can also be from N-H or other types, but in this context, I think O-H is more likely. So that suggests the compound has an -OH group.

The peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the region of carbonyl groups. 1700 is usually a strong peak for a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 peak is lower, which might suggest conjugation or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl. Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an α,β-unsaturated ketone or maybe an aromatic ester.

Wait, but wait: if there are two carbonyl peaks, that suggests two different kinds of carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one group that has different environments. Hmm. So maybe it's something like a conjugated system where the carbonyl is part of a ring or something else. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: the 1700 cm⁻¹ might be a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester), and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation—like an aromatic C=C stretching. Wait, but then why two strong peaks? Alternatively, maybe it's an acid derivative or something else.

Wait, but wait—another thought: Maybe the 165
