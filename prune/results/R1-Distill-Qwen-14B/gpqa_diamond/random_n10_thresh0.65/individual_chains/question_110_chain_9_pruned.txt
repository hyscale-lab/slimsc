Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various observations, like maybe exoplanet studies or measuring stellar velocities.

The key information given is about the apparent V magnitudes each spectrograph can observe. ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, lower magnitude means brighter. So a star with V=16 is brighter than one with V=17. So ESPRESSO can observe fainter stars than HIRES. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than 16, because that's the more restrictive condition since HIRES can't go beyond 16. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. So anything V ≤ 17 is okay for ESPRESSO. And HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V ≤16. So the overlapping condition is V ≤16, since that's the brighter limit of HIRES. So any star that is V ≤16 can be observed by both. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16. So if a star is brighter than 16 (which is V<16), it can be observed by both. Wait, no. Wait, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, magnitude less than 17. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So if a star's V is ≤17, ESPRESSO can see it. For HIRES, V must be ≤16. So for a star to be visible by both, its V must be ≤16 mag.

Wait no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The question says, with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, if a star is brighter than V=17, ESPRESSO can observe it. So m_V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so m_V <16. So for a
