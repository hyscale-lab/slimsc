Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps given, each leading from one compound to the next. Plus, there are some hints provided. The options are four different cycloketones, so E is likely a cyclic ketone.

Let me list the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Elimination of an inert gas from D gives E.

Hmm. Also, there are hints:

a) When A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR of A has a peak at ~1750 cm^-1, E's is ~1715 cm^-1.

So, from the IR data: A has a strong peak around 1750, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. E's peak is at 1715, which is a bit lower wavenumber, but that's still a ketone. Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe A is an ester because esters have higher carbonyl absorption (like around 1740-1750), while ketones are about 1715. Oh, but in this case, E's peak is 1715, which aligns with a ketone. So A might be an ester, and E is a ketone. Alternatively, maybe A is a ketone and E is a more substituted ketone?

Wait, but the reaction steps might clarify that. Let me think about each step.

First step: A reacts with HCN to form B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So A must be a carbonyl compound. If A is a ketone, then adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an ester, HCN could add, but more likely it's a ketone. Or maybe A is an aldehyde? But the IR is 1750, which is more for esters or ketones than aldehydes (aldehydes are around 2800 for the stretch but their carbonyl is around 1720 maybe). Wait, but esters have higher carbonyl absorption, like 1740-1760. So if A is an ester, then B would be the addition product of HCN to that ester.

Wait, but in the case of a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which is a geminal diol? No, wait, no. Wait, HCN adds to ketones in a nucleophilic addition. The ketone (RCOR') would add HCN to form RCOH-C(R')N-CN? No, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

Actually, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So, the carbonyl oxygen is
