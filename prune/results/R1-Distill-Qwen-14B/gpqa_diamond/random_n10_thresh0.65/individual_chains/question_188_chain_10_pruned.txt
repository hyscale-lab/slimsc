Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with rhombohedral crystals. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question states that we have a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all angles α, β, γ equal to 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Hmm, I remember that for crystals like cubic systems, the interplanar distance (d) can be found using the formula d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, that's for cubic structures, right? Rhombohedral is a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees. So the general formula for interplanar distances in a rhombohedral system must take into account the angles between the lattice vectors.

Oh right, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with a rhombohedral lattice is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same (α = β = γ = 30 degrees here), so the formula should simplify a bit. Let me think. Since α = β = γ, the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Which can be rewritten as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) )

In this case, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging in the values, let's compute the denominator first. 

So h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Next, the term 2hk cos α: since h=k=l=1, each term hk is 1, so 2*1*1*cos(30) multiplied by three terms (hk, hl, kl) equals 2*3*cos(30) = 6*(√3/2) = 3√3.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: each of the three terms is 2hk cos α, but since h,k,l are all 1, each term is 2*1*1*cos30. So 2*(1)(1)*cos30 for each of the three terms (hk, hl, kl), so total is 3*(2 cos30) = 6 cos30.

Wait, no. Wait. The formula is (h² +k² +l²) minus 2 cosα (hk + hl + kl). Oh, right. So:

Denominator = sqrt( (3) - 2 cos30 (1 + 1 + 1) )

Because hk + hl + kl = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3.

So, denominator = sqrt(3 - 2 * (√3/2) * 3 )

Simplify that: 2*(√3/2) is √3, multiplied by 3 gives 3√3.

So denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 3√3.

Wait a minute, that would be 3 - 3√3. But wait, √3 is about 1.732, so 3√3 is about 5.196. So 3 -5.196 is negative, which can't be right because we can't take the square root of a negative number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Ah! Wait a second, I must have messed up the signs. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

Wait, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 ( hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ ) )

But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so α=β=γ=30°, so it becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 [ hk cos30 + hl cos30 + kl cos30 ] )

Which factors into:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 cos30 (hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111), h=k=l=1:

Denominator = sqrt(3 - 2*(cos30)*3 )

Which is sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

Wait, 2 *3=6, yes. So cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866.

So 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator is 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Oh wait, that's negative, which can't be. There's something wrong here.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I get the formula wrong? Oh wait, no, perhaps I remember the formula incorrectly. Maybe the angles are in a different arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal system. Another approach is using the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, another way: The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - 2 (hk cos γ)/(a²) - 2 (hl cos β)/(a²) - 2 (kl cos α)/(a²), but wait, in the rhombohedral system, the unit cell is such that a = b = c, and all angles are same. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe I should consider the Miller indices and the relation in a rhombohedral system. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos γ )

Wait, but if α = β = γ, then:

d = a / sqrt( (h + k + l)^2 - (2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α) )

Wait, wait, no, because (h +k + l)^2 is h² +k² +l² + 2hk + 2hl + 2kl. So that's not the same as the denominator.

Wait
