Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let me try to work through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find which energy difference allows them to be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) has to be at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this context, the lifetimes of the states are related to their uncertainties in energy. A shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt. So, the state with a shorter lifetime (1e-9 sec) will have a larger ΔE.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Oh, right, to clearly distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Or maybe each state's uncertainty? Or perhaps the sum? Hmm, not entirely sure. Let me think.

The uncertainty in energy for each state would be determined by their lifetimes. Let me calculate the uncertainty for each. The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2 * τ), where τ is the lifetime. Oh wait, sometimes it's approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, but maybe the exact factor isn't crucial for this problem since the options are orders of magnitude apart.

So, let's compute for each state. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718
