Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are 1.5 bigger. But wait, does mass matter here? The question is about luminosity, which I think depends more on radius and temperature. Hmm, maybe mass doesn't come into play directly unless we're considering something like the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Oh right, because the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. So mass might not be directly relevant unless it's about something else, but maybe the problem gives us something else to consider.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, the peak wavelength λ_max is the same for both stars. Wait, in black body radiation, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max are the same, their temperatures must be the same. So T_1 = T_2.

But wait, let me think again. If both stars have the same λ_max, then according to Wien's law, their temperatures must be equal. So T1 = T2. That's important because in the luminosity equation, temperature is a
