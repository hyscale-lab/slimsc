Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about titration, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, this solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values for these points.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the concentration decreases, which would affect the pH. Since we're adding equal volumes of water and acetic acid, the concentration should be halved. Because the initial volume is 20 cm³ and we add 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration of acetic acid should be 0.025 M, right? Because 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M.

Wait, let me make sure. Molarity is moles per liter. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles remain the same, 0.001 mol, but concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So I need to find two pH values: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me tackle the equivalence point first because that's a standard calculation. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. Let's find the volume needed to reach equivalence. Moles NaOH = moles acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Volume = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait, when you reach equivalence in a weak acid-strong base titration, the solution will be the sodium acetate (the conjugate base of acetic acid) in water. So it's a buffer solution, but since all the acid has been neutralized, it's just the sodium acetate. Then, the solution will be basic because the acetate ion is a weak base.

So the concentration of acetate ions would be moles of acetate divided by total volume. Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. Total volume is the sum of the diluted acetic acid (40 cm³) and the NaOH added (10 cm³) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The pH can be found using the Kb of acetate. Since Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, but wait a second, that's Kb for the acetate ion. The pH of a solution of a weak base can be found by:

OH- concentration is sqrt(Kb * C). Let me calculate that.

C is 0.02 M. So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

Then, pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → No, too low.

Option B: 3.17; 6.73 → No.

Option C: 4.73;7.00 → No.

Option D:4.57;6.92 → Also no.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, at equivalence, the solution is a sodium acetate solution. So the concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recalculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Now, for a weak base (like acetate), the OH- concentration is sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02)
