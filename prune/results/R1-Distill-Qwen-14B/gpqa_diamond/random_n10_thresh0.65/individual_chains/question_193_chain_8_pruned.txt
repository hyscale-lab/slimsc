Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars varies with parallax, and specifically, how it changes with distance. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula I think is that parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1 / r, where r is the distance in parsecs. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's the inverse. Because the parallax is smaller when the object is farther away. So yeah, plx = 1 / r. So as r increases, plx decreases.

The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So that would be N ∝ 1/plx^5. Wait, but since plx is inversely proportional to r, maybe I can substitute that in terms of r.

So substituting plx = 1/r, 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 would be r^5. Because (1/plx) is r, so (1/plx)^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number increases rapidly with distance.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the number of stars in a region of the sky as a function of distance. Wait, but I thought that in astronomy, the
