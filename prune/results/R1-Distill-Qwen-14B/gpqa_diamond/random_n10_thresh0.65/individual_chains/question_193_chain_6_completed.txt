Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given relationship is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. Hmm, right, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax, and vice versa. The formula I think is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs or something like that. So distance d is inversely proportional to parallax plx.

The question asks how the number of stars (N) changes with distance (r) per unit range. So they're asking for the relationship between N and r, which is distance. Let me write down the given: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in.

So substituting plx with 1/d, the equation becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by that would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, but wait, so N is proportional to d^5. But the question asks how N changes with r, which I think is the same as d here.

Wait, but let me think again. Parallax is in inverse relation to distance. So plx = 1/d. So plx is small when d is large. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx = 1/d gives N proportional to d^5, right? Because 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5.

So the number of stars N is proportional to d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number density, like stars per unit volume or something else. Wait, no, the question is about the number of stars in that region as you go to a larger distance. So if I go from r to r + dr, how does the number N(r) change?

Wait, but wait. Maybe I should think in terms of the differential number of stars. Let me think about the volume. Because stars are spread out in 3D space, so the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. So if more stars are at a certain distance, it might relate to the volume.

Wait, but the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, so N is proportional to (d)^5. Since d is the distance, that would mean as d increases, N increases as d^5. But wait, wait, the number of stars in a region depends also on the volume. Wait, perhaps I should model this.

Wait, in astronomy, the number of stars you observe in a certain direction (like in a specific region of the sky) as a function of distance depends on the density of stars and the volume up to that distance. So if the density is uniform, the total number of stars up to distance r would be proportional to r^3, because volume is r^3. But this might not be the case here.

Wait, the given is that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So in the question, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, 1/(plx) is d, so 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N increases with d^5. So if you move from distance r to r + dr, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r^5. Wait, but wait, no. Because for a thin shell at distance r, the volume (or more accurately, the number of stars in that shell) is 4π r² dr multiplied by the number density. But in this case, the number density might not be uniform. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit distance (per unit dr) is what's being asked.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?". Oh, so it's the change in number per unit distance. So perhaps it's the number of stars as a function of r, and the change is the derivative with respect to r.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, so N = k / plx^5, where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/d, N = k * d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. So when d increases by a small amount, the number of stars increases as d^5. But the question is about how N changes with distance per unit range. Hmm. Maybe the question is asking for the differential number of stars per unit distance, like dN/dr.

So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5r^4. But the options don't have r^4 as an option here. Wait, looking at the options:

Options are A) ~ r^3, B) ~ r^5, C) ~ r^4, D) ~ r^2.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So perhaps it's asking about the number of stars per unit distance, which would be dN/dr. If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the change would be proportional to r^4. That would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the cumulative number up to a certain distance. In that case, N ∝ r^5, which is option B. But I think the question is about the number per unit distance, which would be the derivative.

Wait, the wording says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance)". So per unit range (dr) would be the rate of change. So yes, it's dN/dr.

So if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ r^4. So the answer would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but wait another point. The number of stars in a region as a function of distance may also depend on how the area is projected. Wait, no, because the question says "number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So maybe N is the count in a unit area or per unit solid angle. Hmm, perhaps I should think more carefully.

Parallax relates to distance, and the number of stars per unit area (surface density) would be N/A, where A is the area. But perhaps in this case, the number of stars in a region (say, a small area) depends on distance. The way the problem is phrased, it's the number of stars in that region that varies as 1/plx^5. So perhaps it's the number per unit area (so per steradian or per square degree). So for a given area, the number of stars you see at a certain distance is proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx is 1/d, that becomes d^5. So for a given area, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. Wait, that doesn't make sense because as d increases, you can see more stars? But that's not the usual case. Normally, the number of stars you see depends on the volume, which increases with d^3. Unless the star density increases with distance, but that's not the usual case.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when plx is small (large d), the number is higher. So more stars are seen at larger distances. That's unusual because in reality, the density of stars in the galaxy decreases with distance from the galactic plane, but perhaps in this scenario, it's different.

But regardless, the question is about how the number changes with distance. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which equals d^5. So N = k d^5.

Now, the number of stars as a function of distance. So the number increases rapidly with distance. But when you're considering how many stars are there per unit distance, you're looking at the rate of change. So dN/dr = 5 k d^4.

So the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be C) r^4.

Another way to think about it: the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is the derivative of N with respect to r. Since N ∝ r^5, dN/dr ∝ 5 r^4. So the answer is C.


The question asks how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)), given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**: Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \), we find:
   \[
   N \propto d^5
   \]
   This means the number of stars increases as \( d^5 \).

2. **Interpreting the Question**: The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This implies the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), i.e., \( dN/dr \).

3. **Calculating the Derivative**: Since \( N \propto d^5 \), taking the derivative with respect to \( r \) gives:
   \[
   \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
   \]
   Thus, the number of stars per unit distance changes proportionally to \( r^4 \).

4. **Matching with Options**: Among the given options:
   - \( A) \sim r^3 \): Incorrect, as the relationship is \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
   - \( B) \sim r^5 \): Incorrect, as this represents the cumulative number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
   - \( C) \sim r^4 \): Correct, as shown by the derivative calculation.
   - \( D) \sim r^2 \): Incorrect, as it does not match the derived relationship.

### Conclusion:
The number of stars per unit distance changes proportionally to \( r^4 \).
