Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question probably wants probabilities, which require a normalized state.

Wait, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So they form an orthonormal basis. That means the inner product of |up> and |down> is zero, and each has a norm of 1.

The state given is proportional, so I need to find the constant of proportionality. Let me write the state as |alpha> = a(1+i)|up> + a(2-i)|down>, where a is the proportionality constant. But wait, noâ€”since it's proportional, maybe it's just written as |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but without normalization. So I need to find the normalization factor.

To normalize, the inner product of |alpha> with itself should be 1. So calculate the norm squared. The inner product is <alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Because the cross terms (like (1+i)(2+i) and its conjugate) would be zero since the basis is orthonormal.

Wait, |1+i| squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 = a^2 + b^2. So 1^2 + 1^2 = 2. Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the total is 2+5=7. Therefore, the state is (1/sqrt(7)) times [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>], because the norm is sqrt(7), so to make it 1, multiply by 1/sqrt(7).

So the normalized |alpha> is [ (1+i) |up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next part: Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the given operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/
