Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model or non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and it absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for both rotation and vibration (bond stretching). In the quantum mechanical model, each mode (rotation and vibration) has quantized energy levels.

So the molecule can change states either by changing rotational energy, vibrational energy, or both. But the question specifies the lowest possible energy state after the transition. So what's the next state in terms of energy?

Let me recall. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the molecule, which corresponds to the ground state of both rotation and vibration. So for vibration, the ground state is n=0. For rotation, the ground state is usually the lowest rotational state, which is J=0 (I think). 

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to a higher energy state. But the question asks for the photon that causes a switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So this probably means the smallest possible energy increment, which would involve the smallest possible change in energy.

Wait, but since the molecule's state is determined by both J and n, the next state would be the one where the sum of the changes in energy from rotation and vibration is the smallest. So I need to find the transition that requires the least photon energy. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a transition that only involves one of the modes (either rotation or vibration) since combining both might lead to higher energy jumps.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So n=0 and J=0. The next possible state could be either n=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state). Which transition requires less energy?

Because the photon's energy determines the transition. The one with the lower energy transition would be the correct answer.

So I need to calculate the energy differences for both possible transitions and see which is smaller.

Let's compute the vibrational energy difference first. Vibrational energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) h Î½. So
