Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two reactions, and I need to find the right reagents from the options given. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagents A and B.

Hmm, let's tackle each reaction step by step.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. The reagents are NaCN and A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait a second, when a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that typically this is a nucleophilic addition. In the case of ketones and aldehydes, the reaction with HCN or CN- usually adds the cyano group to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, so under certain conditions, maybe it undergoes addition.

Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. The product has a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. That suggests that the CN added to the carbonyl, and then the oxygen was replaced by OH. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it out mentally.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When reacting with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. That's the typical mechanism for such additions. So after addition, you get (CH3)2C(OH)CN? No, wait. Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it adds to give a cyanohydrin. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm
