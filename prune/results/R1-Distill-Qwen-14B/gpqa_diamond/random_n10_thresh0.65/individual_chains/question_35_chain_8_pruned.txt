Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay φ = a φ. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second is (i, 0). So S looks like [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are involved with spin. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh, right, σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S must be the Pauli Y matrix. That makes sense.

Now, since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), then Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by σy. So the matrix Ay would be:
[[0, (-i)(h/(4π))],
 [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh right, eigenvalues are found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me write out the matrix Ay. The diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are ±i * h/(4π). So the matrix is:

[ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

The eigenvalues equation is det(Ay - a I) = 0. The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ [ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1)=1. So the determinant becomes a² - (h²/(16 π²)) * 1. 

Setting this equal to zero: a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, but wait a second, the eigenvalues are a = ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but h is Planck's constant. Oh, but sometimes we use ħ which is h/(2π). So ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. 

Hmm, but looking at the options, let me see.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π). That doesn't seem right because the eigenvalues I found are real. Oh wait, no, because the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Because S is Hermitian since its transpose is equal to its complex conjugate. Let me check: S is [[0, -i],[i,0
