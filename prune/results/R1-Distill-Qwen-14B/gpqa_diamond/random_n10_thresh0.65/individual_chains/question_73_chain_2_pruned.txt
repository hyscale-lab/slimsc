Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, so first, I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics because the speeds add up differently. So I think I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the relative speed. And for the total energy, I think each astronaut's energy should be considered, adding their relativistic energies together.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The question is about the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. Oh no, wait, no. Because both are moving in the same direction, I think. So maybe the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds? In classical mechanics, if one is moving at v1 and the other at v2, the relative speed is v1 - v2 if they're in the same direction. But relativistically, it's more complicated.

Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, I'm not entirely certain about the signs. Let me imagine: if both are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2/c²)). Oh wait, but that depends on which frame you're considering. Actually, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of one object and v is the velocity of the other as seen from the rest frame. So in this case, since both are moving in the same frame, maybe I have to treat it differently.

Wait, wait. Let me step back. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of the stationary observer (let's say Earth frame), A is moving faster than B. So the relative speed
