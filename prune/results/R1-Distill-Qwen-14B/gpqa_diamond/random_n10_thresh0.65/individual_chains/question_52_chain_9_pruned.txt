Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a star with certain characteristics. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, so the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is spotless, the ratio is higher, and when spotted, it's lower. The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes from when there are no spots to when 40% of the surface is covered. So essentially, what is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots?

Hmm. The problem mentions that we can assume the photosphere is in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. That means the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the transition wavelength is given as approximately 1448 Å. That's about 1448 Angstroms, which is 144.8 nm. I think that's in the extreme ultraviolet or far UV range. But maybe more importantly, this transition corresponds to a photon emitted when an electron moves between these two energy levels. So the energy difference between the two levels is E = hc / λ, right?

So I can calculate the energy difference using the wavelength. Let's compute that.

The energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels is given by ΔE = hc / λ. H is Planck's constant, c speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. Wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters, or 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

Let me calculate that: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 1.448e-7 m gives approximately 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, but I might need this in terms of energy per particle in terms of k*T. Because the Boltzmann factor is (E_i - E_j)/(k T). Wait, but E is (ΔE) in the equation.

Wait, so the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is -(E2 - E1)/(k T), depending on how you define the levels. But in the ratio n1/n2, assuming level 2 is higher than level 1, so E2 > E1. So (E2 - E1) is positive. So the exponent is negative.

But wait, the question is about the ratio when spots are present. So, when the star is spotted, the effective temperature is lower. So the temperature T in the exponent will be lower, leading to a higher exponent (since T is in denominator), which would make the ratio n1/n2 smaller, because exponent is more
