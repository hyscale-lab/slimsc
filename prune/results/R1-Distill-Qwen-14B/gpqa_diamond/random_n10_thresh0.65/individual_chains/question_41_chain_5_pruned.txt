Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in moving glass. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll think it through.

The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm, so the glass is moving toward me, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light beam?

I remember that in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is about light moving through a medium, like glass. Oh wait, no, wait. When light is in a medium, its speed is v = c/n. But that's in the rest frame of the medium, right?

But wait, the medium (the glass) is moving relative to the lab frame. So I think I need to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. Because the speed measured in different frames depends on their relative motion.

So, the velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), but wait, that's when the source is moving towards the observer. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for when you have a velocity u in
