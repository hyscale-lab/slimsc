Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles the same, right? So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... that's the d-spacing, right? So I need to find the d value for the (111) planes. I think the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal depends on the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right, for a general crystal system, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2 hk cos α) / (a²) ... wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the general formula for a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for non-cubic systems, like rhombohedral, the formula is a bit more complicated. Because the unit cell isn't cubic; the angles between the axes aren't 90 degrees, so the formula involves the angles as well.

I think the formula for a rhombohedral crystal is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hk cos β + hl cos γ) )? Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up here. Alternatively, I remember that when the angles are all equal (rhombohedral), the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait another approach: The interplanar distance formula for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system... Wait, no, hexagonal systems have different formulas. Wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system? Or is it a separate category? Hmm... I think rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. Right, rhombohedral is where all edges are equal and angles are all equal but not 90 degrees. So, for a rhombohedral system, the formula for d-spacing is d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α) + ... wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively
