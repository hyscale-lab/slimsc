Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down. 

First, the gas W. W's molecule has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule must be something with the same number of protons and neutrons in each atom. Wait, no—the molecule as a whole. So for example, if the molecule is O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (in the common isotope). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So protons and neutrons per molecule are equal. So that fits. Alternatively, H2O has H and O, but let me check. H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons each, O has 8 each. So for H2O: total protons would be 2 +8=10, neutrons would be 0 +8=8. Not equal. So no. Another possibility is NH3? Let's see: N has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So molecule has 7 + 3(1) =10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (if it's N-14?), H has 0. So 7 neutrons. Not equal. So 10 vs 7, so no.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the gas is something like CO2? Let me see. C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So CO2: 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C is 6 (if it's C-12) and O is 8 each. So total neutrons 6 + 2*8 =22. Oh! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in total. That would fit. So W is CO2? Or wait, wait another idea: what about O2? Each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that's equal. So W could be O2, but that's a gas when released. Alternatively, maybe something else.

Wait, but when X reacts with Y, what could they be? X is a substance that reacts with a liquid. Let me think about possible reactions. Maybe X is a metal reacting with an acid. For example, metals reacting with acids produce hydrogen gas. But in that case, W would be H2. Let's see: H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. So protons and neutrons are 2 and 0, which aren't equal. So that can't be W.

Alternatively, maybe W is CO2, as I thought before. Let's think of a reaction that produces CO2. For example, heating a carbonate with an acid. But the question says X reacts with Y violently. Maybe X is a carbonate and Y is an acid? Or maybe X is something else.

Wait, another angle. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Wait, no, 273 K is 0 degrees, so 277 is about 4°C. What substance has a melting point near there? Maybe water? No, water's melting point is 273 K. Hmm, perhaps something else. Or maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, B is released upon heating G. Could G be a carbonate and upon heating, it decomposes? Let's say, perhaps, if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction could produce CO2, water, and a salt (precipitate G). Then heating G might decompose it into something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and an acid. Let's say X is a metal (like sodium), Y is water, but that doesn't produce CO2. Hmm.

Wait, going back to the product of a keto acid with X. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids have a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group. For example, a reaction with a base might deprotonate the acid. Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Maybe X is a strong base, like NaH or something that deprotonates acids.

Wait, another thought: if the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms, perhaps X is something that adds an oxygen or removes a hydrogen. Alternatively, maybe X is a reducing agent, adding hydrogen.

Wait, the product has two oxygen atoms. Wait, what if the keto acid is reacting with X to form something like an enolate? Or maybe the keto acid is being deprotonated to form a conjugate base, which would have an additional oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a strong base like NaOH. Wait, but sodium hydroxide is used in organic reactions as a base, but would it react with a keto acid? Maybe more likely, X is something like DMSO or another polar aprotic solvent, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, X could be something like LiAlH4, a strong reducing agent. But how would that react with a keto acid? Maybe it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. Wait, but that would change the functional groups.

Hmm, perhaps the product has two oxygen atoms because X adds an O somewhere. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, like sodium, which when reacts with a keto acid could cause some substitution or addition.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, like sodium, which is a strong reducing agent. Sodium reacts with alcohols to form sodium alkoxide and hydrogen gas. Hmmm, but how would that tie into the first part of the question?

Wait, let me try to re-examine the initial reaction. X reacts with Y violently to produce gas W, which is CO2. So perhaps Y is an acid, X is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate reacting with sulfuric acid would produce CO2, water, and sodium sulfate. Then the precipitate G would be sodium sulfate? But sodium sulfate is soluble, so maybe Y is something else.

Wait, wait, maybe Y is water. If X is sodium, which reacts with water violently, producing H2 gas. But earlier I thought W wouldn't be H2 because the protons and neutrons wouldn't match. But wait, the H2 molecule has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons:2, neutrons:0. So they're not equal. So W can't be H2.

Hmm, back to the gas W. So, another option: if W is carbon monoxide (CO), then each molecule has 6 protons (C) and 8 protons (O), so 14? Wait, no, each molecule has 1 C and 1 O. So total protons per molecule would be 6 +8=14. Neutrons per molecule: C has 6 (C-12), O has 8 (O-16). So 6+8=14. So that fits. So W could be CO.

So what reaction produces CO gas? Well, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a weak acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the decomposition of a carbonate, but that usually produces CO2.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal carbonate, like sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and Y is a strong acid like HCl. The reaction would produce CO2, water, and NaCl. NaCl is soluble, so precipitate G may not form. Unless Y is a different acid that produces an insoluble salt.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a liquid (like water), but that might produce H2 gas. But earlier that didn't fit W.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal oxide reacting with an acid. Wait, but that would produce water and a salt.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid that produces a precipitate. For instance, if X is sodium carbonate and Y is a solution of silver nitrate. Then, the reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and Ag2CO3 (silver carbonate), which is a precipitate. Then G would be Ag2CO3. Upon heating, perhaps it decomposes into Ag2O and CO2. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but when G is heated, it releases B. If G is Ag2CO3, upon heating, maybe it becomes Ag2O and CO2. So B would be Ag2O. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let me check the melting point of silver oxide (Ag2O). Silver oxide has a melting point around 1537°C, which is way higher than 277 K (which is about 4°C), so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. What compounds have a melting point around there? Maybe something like water ice, but that's 273 K. Alternatively, some other hydrate or compound.

Wait, perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, calcium chloride hexahydrate has a melting point of about 277 K. Or maybe it's not a compound, but another form of water, like ice. Wait, but B is a product when G is heated. So perhaps G is a hydrate that, upon heating, loses water (B) which is then ice? That seems a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think. Maybe B is sodium carbonate decahydrate or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal oxide. Wait, if X is sodium oxide, and Y is water, the reaction would produce NaOH. But that doesn't produce a gas. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let me think about substance X. The question says X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So possible candidates for X could be something like DMSO (used as a polar aprotic solvent) or something like THF, or maybe a base like NaH or KOtBu.

Wait, another thought: X is a reducing agent. For example, NaBH4 or LiAlH4. But those are usually used in solution. Wait, maybe X is something like sodium metal. Sodium is a strong reducing agent and reacts violently with water. So let's say X is sodium (Na), Y is water.

So, when sodium reacts with water, it produces NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. So W would be H2. But earlier I thought H2 doesn't fit because W's molecule has same protons and neutrons. But let's double-check: H2 has 2 H atoms, each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons: 2, neutrons: 0. Not equal. So W wouldn't be H2.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps X isn't sodium.

Wait, another possibility: X is a heavy isotope. Wait, the first part says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps X is a compound where one of the elements has a heavier isotope. For example, chlorine has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if X is, say, CHCl3, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the product of a keto acid with X having two oxygen atoms. So, if X is a base that deprotonates a keto acid, the product would have an additional oxygen in the form of the conjugate base. For example, a keto acid like cyclohexanone carboxylic acid. When deprotonated, it becomes a conjugate base, which has the same number of oxygens as the acid? Or maybe it adds an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps X is a strong base like NaOH. So when it reacts with a keto acid (which is a carboxylic acid with a ketone group), it would deprotonate it to form the conjugate base. The product would have more oxygen atoms? Or perhaps it's just a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like DMSO, which is a polar aprotic solvent. DMSO is used in Swern oxidations, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones. So if X is DMSO, reacting with a primary alcohol would produce a ketone.

Wait, but the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonyl reagent. For example, in the formation of an enol ether.

Wait, I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to connect the dots.

So, the reaction of X with Y produces gas W (CO?), precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with melting point ~277 K. The product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms.

Wait, perhaps W is CO. So the reaction is between X and Y producing CO. How? Maybe X is carbon, and Y is something that oxidizes carbon to CO. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is a weak acid, but that usually produces CO2, not CO.

Wait, another angle: if W is CO2, which is produced in the reaction. So X and Y could be a carbonate and an acid. For example, X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl. The reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and NaCl. NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. So perhaps Y isn't HCl but another acid that forms an insoluble salt. For example, if Y is AgNO3 solution, then X is Na2CO3. The reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and Ag2CO3. Ag2CO3 is a precipitate (G). Then, heating Ag2CO3 would decompose into 2AgO and CO2? Or perhaps it's more complex. Alternatively, upon heating, Ag2CO3 might decompose into AgO and CO2. Then B would be AgO. What's the melting point of AgO? Silver(I) oxide (AgO) has a melting point around 850°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe B is sodium carbonate. But sodium carbonate's melting point is around 1800°C, which is too high.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. The melting point of 277 K is about 4°C. What compounds have that melting point? Let me think of something like ammonium nitrate, but that's more about exothermic dissolving. Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a lower melting point. Or maybe B is something like paraffin wax, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe B is water. Wait, if G is a hydrate, upon heating, it releases water. So B is H2O. H2O has a melting point of 273 K, which is very close to 277 K. Wait, but 277 K is 4°C, which is just a bit higher. So perhaps it's water, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if G is a hydrated salt, upon heating, it loses water (B), which could be in the form of steam, but then B would be water vapor. Hmm, but the melting point of B is 277 K, which is solid. So if B is ice, but that's at 273 K.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think of another approach. Since the melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4°C, perhaps B is a type of ice or a hydrate. Wait, maybe it's a different crystal form of water, like ice II or something, but that's probably too advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound altogether, like ammonium chloride, which has a melting point of around 337°C, which is way higher. So that's not it.

Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track. Let me think again about the initial reaction. If W is CO2, then the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So what if Y is a carbonate and X is something else? Or perhaps X is carbon, and Y is something that oxidizes it. Wait, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a hydroxide. For example, sodium hydroxide. If Y is a carbonate, but that would produce CO2 and sodium carbonate again. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal and Y is an acid. When a metal reacts with an acid, H+ ions are released, producing H2 gas. But as before, W would be H2, which doesn't fit the protons and neutrons condition.

Wait, so maybe the gas W is CO2, as I thought earlier. Then, the reaction produces CO2, which implies a carbonate reacting with an acid. So X could be a carbonate, Y an acid, producing CO2, water, and a salt (G). Then, when G is heated, perhaps it decomposes into something else with a melting point near 277 K.

Wait, but what if G is a bicarbonate? For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). If heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be Na2CO3, but its melting point is about 1800°C, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the product of X with a keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two ketone groups and a carboxylic acid group). If X is a base, it would deprotonate the acid, producing a conjugate base. That would add an oxygen (from the hydroxide ion) but not necessarily increase the oxygen count in the molecule. Alternatively, perhaps X is a reagent that adds an oxygen, like an oxidizing agent.

Wait, maybe X is a strong oxidizing agent. For example, KMnO4. But then, the product would have more oxygen. Alternatively, maybe X is something like ozone, which adds an oxygen across double bonds. But I'm not sure how that would relate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent, and the reaction adds hydrogen. For example, LiAlH4 reduces a ketone to an alcohol, but that would add hydrogen, not oxygen.

Hmm. Let me think about the element in X that has a heavier isotope. So X contains at least two elements, one of which has a heavier isotope. For example, chlorine has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37, so if X contains Cl, perhaps the heavier isotope is Cl-37.

Wait, perhaps X is CHCl3, which contains Cl. But then, in the reaction with Y, what would happen? Not sure.

Alternatively, X could be something like CCl4, but that's more inert.

Wait, another approach. The product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So, for example, a keto acid has structure R-CO-COOH. If X removes a hydrogen, perhaps the product becomes R-CO-COO^- Na^+ (sodium salt), which has the same number of oxygen atoms as the keto acid. Hmm, but that doesn't change the count.

Alternatively, maybe X is a base that deprotonates the acid, but that wouldn't add oxygen. Unless X is something that adds an oxygen, like an oxidizing agent.

Wait, perhaps X is DMSO, which is used in oxidations. For example, in the Swern oxidation, DMSO is used with a base to oxidize alcohols to ketones. So, if the keto acid is an alcohol (but wait, no, it's a keto acid), maybe DMSO is involved in some way. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a solvent, like THF, which is used in various reactions but doesn't add oxygen.

Wait, maybe X is something like dimethylformamide (DMF), which is a polar aprotic solvent. But again, not sure.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the other parts of the question again.

The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, first, I need to find out what elements are in X. Let me suppose X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Its constituent elements are Na, C, O. The lightest is C (12), the heaviest is Na (23) or O (16). Wait, no, Na is 23, O is 16. So the heaviest is Na. So the sum would be 12 (C) +23 (Na) =35? Wait, but then the options have 35 as option A. But wait, wait. Let me re-read the question.

The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So, for each element in X, sum all isotopes (i.e., the total mass considering all isotopes present?), and then take the lightest and heaviest elements and sum their atomic masses.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses in X. For example, if X has elements A, B, C, with atomic masses a, b, c, then find a + c, where a is the smallest, c the largest.

So, if X is Na2CO3, the elements are Na (23), C (12), O (16). So lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A.

But earlier I thought X might be a carbonate, which would fit some reactions. Let me see if that fits with the other clues.

So, X is Na2CO3. It reacts with Y (maybe HCl) to produce CO2 (gas W), water, and NaCl (G). NaCl is soluble, so perhaps Y is a different acid that produces an insoluble salt.

Wait, but in that case, G would be the insoluble salt. Suppose Y is AgNO3: Na2CO3 + 2AgNO3 → 2NaNO3 + Ag2CO3 ↓ + CO2↑ + H2O.

Ag2CO3 is a precipitate (G). Then, upon heating, Ag2CO3 may decompose into AgO and CO2. But the melting point of AgO is higher than 277 K, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a nitric acid, but then the products would be different.

Wait, perhaps Y is not an acid. Maybe it's another liquid, like water. Na2CO3 is more soluble in water, but if Y is a different solvent, perhaps something else happens. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. If X is Na2CO3, perhaps it reacts with a keto acid to form sodium salt of the keto acid. But that doesn't add oxygen; it just deprotonates.

Alternatively, maybe X is something else. Let me think, if X is sodium oxide (Na2O), reacting with Y (maybe CO2) to form Na2CO3. But that doesn't fit the reaction description.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide. For example, NaOH reacts with a carbonate to produce CO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)C(O)OH). If X is NaOH, then the product would be the conjugate base: CH3C(O)C(O)O^- Na^+. But that doesn't add any oxygen atoms; it just deprotonates. So the number of oxygen atoms remains the same.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the first part. If X is Na2CO3, which has elements Na, C, O. The lightest atomic mass is C (12), the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A. But wait, what about if X is something else, like CaCO3? Then, elements are Ca (40), C (12), O (16). Sum would be 12 +40 =52, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, if X is KCl, which has K (39) and Cl (35.5). Heaviest is K, lightest is Cl. Wait, no, Cl is heavier than K? No, K is about 39, Cl is about 35.5. So lightest is Cl, heaviest is K. Sum is 35.5 +39 =74.5, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid). Its elements are C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, which is option B is 25, no. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol). Elements C, H, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH4Cl. Constituents N, H, Cl. Atomic masses are N (14), H (1), Cl (35.5). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which is about 36.5, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Atomic masses: Na (23), C (12), O (16). Lightest is C (12), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A. But earlier I thought that the precipitate G would be something else.

Wait, but the problem states that X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, for example, if X is Na2CO3, the Na could be the heavier isotope, but that's not a big deal. Or, maybe one of the oxygens is a heavier isotope, like O-18.

Wait, the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So, considering all elements in X, find the lightest and heaviest in terms of atomic mass, then sum their masses.

So, if X is Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. So lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). So sum is 35, which is option A.

But earlier I wasn't sure about the reactions, but given the options, 35 is an option. So perhaps the correct answer is A) 35.

Wait, but what if X is another compound? Let's think of another possibility. Suppose X is NaOH. Elements Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which is option B is 25, so not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is CaCO3. Elements Ca (40), C (12), O (16). Sum is 12 +40=52, which isn't an option.

Hmm. So based on the initial analysis, the most plausible scenario seems to be that X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, leading to a sum of 35, which is option A.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and ultimately a compound B with a melting point close to 277 K. Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. This suggests W could be CO₂, as each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. CO₂ is a plausible gas formed in reactions involving carbonates and acids.

2. **Precipitate G and Compound B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C). This melting point aligns with water (H₂O), but B is not explicitly identified as water. G could be a salt formed during the reaction, and B might be a decomposition product of G.

3. **Reaction of X with a Keto Acid**: The product of this reaction contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X could act as a base, deprotonating the keto acid to form its conjugate base, which retains the same number of oxygen atoms.

4. **Substance X**: X is described as a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. A plausible candidate for X is sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), which reacts with acids to produce CO₂, water, and a salt (G). Sodium carbonate contains sodium (Na), carbon (C), and oxygen (O).

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: 
   - Sodium (Na) has an atomic mass of approximately 23.
   - Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12.
   - Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16.
   - The lightest element in Na₂CO₃ is carbon (C, 12), and the heaviest is sodium (Na, 23). Their cumulative atomic masses sum to 12 + 23 = 35.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) elements in X (Na₂CO₃) are 12 and 23, respectively, summing to 35. This matches option A.
