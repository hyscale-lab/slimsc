Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let's see what I remember about this.

The problem states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere relates to the thermal energy of the star. Since both photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here. 

The Boltzmann distribution says that the population of energy levels is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. So the ratio of the populations (excitation) between the two stars should relate to their temperatures.

In star_1, the population is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the population ratio as n1/n2 = 2. According to the Boltzmann equation, this ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ).

Wait, let me double-check that. The Boltzmann factor for each star would be for their respective temperatures. So for star 1, the population is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). So the ratio n1/n2 is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )).

Wait, no, wait: if n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), then n1/n2 is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )).

Wait, no, because when you subtract exponents, it's exp(a - b) = exp(a) / exp(b). So the ratio becomes exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ).

So n1/n2 =
