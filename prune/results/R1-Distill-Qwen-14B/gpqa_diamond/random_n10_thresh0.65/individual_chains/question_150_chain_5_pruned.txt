Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it describes a series of reactions this compound undergoes, and I need to identify the final product from the given options.

First, I'll break down the problem. The compound has the formula C8H9NO. Let's compute the degree of unsaturation to get an idea about the structure. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, and O=1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5. Wait, that can't be right because degrees of unsaturation should be a whole number. Did I do the calculation correctly?

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Oh, wait, X is halogens, but here there are none. So the formula is C8H9NO. So, applying the formula: (2*8 +2 -9 +0 +1)/2. Wait, wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So in this case, X (halogens) is zero. So it's (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Let's compute: 16+2 is 18, minus 9 is 9, plus 1 is 10. 10/2 is 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation.

Each degree could be a ring or a double bond. So 5 might be a combination. For example, one ring and four double bonds? That seems unlikely. More likely, it's a structure with rings and maybe aromatic rings.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's an aldehyde.

Then, 6.98 ppm is a doublet (2H), 6.51 is another doublet (2H). These look like two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet (2H), which might be something
