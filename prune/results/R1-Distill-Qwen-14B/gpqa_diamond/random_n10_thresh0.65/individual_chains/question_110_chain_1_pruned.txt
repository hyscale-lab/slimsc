Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different brightness limits. Let me try to think through this.

First, I should probably figure out what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, wait—no, actually, the way it's phrased is that they can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Oh right, because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So wait, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, meaning V less than or equal to 17, right? Because if a star is 17 mag, is that the limit? Or is it that they can't observe anything fainter than 17? I think it's the latter. So stars with apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 mag (i.e., V <17) can be observed. So ESPRESSO's limit is V <=17.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So for HIRES, apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 16. So only stars with V <=16 mag can be seen by HIRES. Because if a star is fainter than 16, like 17, HIRES can't see it.

Wait, but wait—apparent magnitude is how bright the star appears from Earth. So for a star to be detectable by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude that is <=17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and also <=16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, no. Wait, both spectrographs can see if the star's apparent V is <=17. But wait, HIRES can't see anything beyond 16. So to be detected by both, the star must have V <=16 mag. Because if it's more than 16, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So the star must be <=16 mag to be seen by both.

So the stars that can be seen by both would have apparent V mag less than or equal to 16.

Wait, but wait the question is about which of the given stars can be detected with both. So for each star, we need to calculate their apparent V magnitude, and see if it's <=16.

Wait, but not all stars have their apparent V given. Some have absolute magnitude given
