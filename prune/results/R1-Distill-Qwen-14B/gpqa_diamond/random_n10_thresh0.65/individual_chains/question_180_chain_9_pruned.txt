Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 3.2e-19 C? Wait, no, 2e is 2 times e, so yeah, that's correct.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Wait, what's the energy in an electrostatic system? Oh right, the potential energy between point charges. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * |q1 q2| / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Since the system is isolated, the total energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, in this setup, one charge is fixed at P, and the others are at a fixed distance from P. So the charge at P is interacting with each of the 12 charges at 2 meters. Also, the 12 charges are all at the same point—wait, no, they're each at 2 m from P, but are they all at
