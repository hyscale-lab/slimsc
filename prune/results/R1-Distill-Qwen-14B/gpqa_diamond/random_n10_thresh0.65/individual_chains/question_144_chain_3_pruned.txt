Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and their decay properties depend on things like their energy, mass, and width. 

The question gives me some specific values: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a different distance value.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. I remember the formula for the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by the total decay width Γ. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again: the mean lifetime τ (also called the proper lifetime) is given by τ = ħ / Γ. 

But wait, the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, right? Because its energy is much higher than its rest mass. So the total lifetime we calculate is in the particle's rest frame, but in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so the time it lives is longer due to time dilation. Oh right, so the mean path length depends on both the lifetime and the velocity of the particle.

So the steps are: first, calculate the proper lifetime τ, then find the velocity of the particle, then calculate the time dilation factor gamma (γ), then multiply τ by γ and the velocity to get the mean decay distance.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate τ = ħ / Γ.
   But wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The value I remember is ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because Γ is given in MeV, I need to convert units. Oh, so Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32. Let me compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.05
