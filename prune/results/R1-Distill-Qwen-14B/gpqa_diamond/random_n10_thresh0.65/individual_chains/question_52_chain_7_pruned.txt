Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star whose surface temperature changes when spots appear. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, I remember that the number of atoms in different energy levels in a star's photosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution tells us how particles distribute themselves among different energy states based on temperature and energy differences between the states.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights (or degeneracies), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. I guess the spots are cooler regions, so the average temperature of the photosphere goes down. But wait, the star isn't uniformly at 5500 K—40% of the surface is spots, and the rest is at 6000 K. Or does the presence of spots lower the overall Teff as an average?

Wait, the question says when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Oh, wait, no—the Teff is the effective temperature, which is a measure of the star's total luminosity. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall flux is less, so the effective temperature decreases. But does the photosphere locally have a lower temperature in the spotted regions? Or maybe the spots are cooler, so the star's overall emission is less, making the effective temp 5500 K.

But in terms of the ratio of the Ti atoms' energy levels, we're looking at the photosphere as a whole. So I think the problem is assuming that the temperature of the photosphere is changing from 6000 K to 5500 K. Wait, but the star isn't uniform. The spots are cooler, but the rest is at 6000 K. So the photosphere has a mixture of temperatures. However, the problem says to assume LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), which I think implies that each region is treated in its own thermal state, but when we observe the star, the overall spectrum may be a blend of regions at different temperatures.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. So perhaps the observed ratio is an average weighted by the areas. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem simplifies the situation by considering an average temperature, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem
