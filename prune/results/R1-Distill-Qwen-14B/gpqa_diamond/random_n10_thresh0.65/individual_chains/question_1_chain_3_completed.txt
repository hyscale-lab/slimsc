Okay, so I have this physics problem here about quantum states and their lifetimes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about two energy levels with different lifespans, and we need to find the energy difference that allows them to be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It says that you can't precisely know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle. The product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, but I think for order of magnitude estimates, it's often approximated as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. Or wait, maybe it's ħ/2? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants, but I'll proceed.

The problem gives the lifetimes as 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. So, one is an order of magnitude longer than the other. The question is about the energy difference needed to distinguish them. I think that the energy difference has to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state so that their signals don't overlap.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE_i is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime τ_i. Let me write that down. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

But what's ħ? Planck's constant over 2π. I remember that ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since we're dealing with eV, maybe I should convert that into eV·s. Oh wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So ħ in eV·s would be 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, for the first state with τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV. That's approximately 6.58e-7 eV.

For the second state with τ2=1e-8 s, ΔE2 is (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.582e-8 eV.

But wait, the problem is about distinguishing two states. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty in either state, their signals would overlap and you can't distinguish them.

So let me compare the energy difference options given. The options are A) 1e-9 eV, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8.

Wait, the first state has a larger uncertainty (6.58e-7 eV) compared to the second (6.58e-8 eV). So the bigger uncertainty is from the first state. Therefore, the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than about 6.58e-7 eV to be resolved.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 is 0.001e-7 → much smaller than the required 6.58e-7.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 → 1e-4 is much bigger than 6.58e-7 (since 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658). So 1e-4 is way larger than the required 6.58e-7. So this would work.

D) 1e-8 → which is 0.00000001. 0.00000001 is smaller than 0.000000658, so it's not enough.

So the only option that's larger than the largest uncertainty is option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the uncertainty for each state is 6.58e-7 and 6.58e-8, respectively. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or just larger than the larger uncertainty?

Hmm, thinking about it. If you have two energy levels, E1 and E2, their uncertainties are ΔE1 and ΔE2. For them to be distinguishable, the separation between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if E2 - E1 is less than ΔE1 + ΔE2, the two might overlap.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the two states have energies E1 and E2. The energy difference we're considering is |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, this difference must be greater than the uncertainty in each, right? Because if the difference is smaller than either uncertainty, you can't tell them apart. But if it's larger than both, then you can.

So let's compute the larger uncertainty, which is ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking back at the options:

C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 6.58e-7 eV (which is 0.000000658 eV). So option C is the only one that satisfies this condition.

Wait, but let me recheck the numbers. For τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1=6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV. τ2=1e-8 s, ΔE2=6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So the larger uncertainty is 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than that. So the correct answer is C.


To determine which energy difference allows the two quantum states to be clearly distinguished, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy for a state with lifetime \( \tau \) is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For the two states:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
   \]

The larger uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). To distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than this larger uncertainty.

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much larger than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
