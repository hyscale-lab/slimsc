Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about stars and parallax. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and it's asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various power laws, like 1 over plx to some exponent.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, right? So as parallax increases, the distance decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means the number density is uniform in some way. But how?

Let me think in terms of volume. Because parallax relates to distance, maybe I should consider the volume of space at a certain distance.

If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's say the number density is n. So the total number of stars between distance d and d + dd would be n multiplied by the volume in that shell.

Wait, the volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. So the number of stars in terms of parallax would be n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). Since plx = 1/d, dd is the change in distance. But wait, d = 1/plx, so if plx changes by dplx, the distance changes by dd = - (d^2) dplx, because plx = 1/d, so d plx = - d^2 dd. Wait, maybe I should think about how d changes with plx.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of plx. So, let me write the number of stars as a function of parallax.

The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * 4π d² * (dd), but d = 1/plx, so d = 1/plx. So d squared is 1/plx squared. And what's dd in terms of dplx?

Because plx = 1/d, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. But since we're dealing with absolute numbers, perhaps the negative sign just indicates direction, so in terms of magnitude, the change in d is proportional to 1/plx² times dplx.

Wait, so putting it all together: N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). And since dd = (1/plx²) * dplx, substituting into N gives:

N = n *4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that would be N = 4πn (1/plx^4) dplx. Wait, that seems to lead to N proportional to 1/plx^4. But wait, that would be the number per unit dplx.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The number of stars per unit parallax range (dplx) is N = number
