Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about identifying a compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are also some hints provided, so I should definitely pay attention to those.

First, let me outline the steps given:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E’s is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are various cyclic ketones, so E is likely a ketone.

Let's break this down step by step.

Starting with compound A. It reacts with HCN to form B. HCN is typically used for the formation of nitriles from aldehydes or ketones via the Stephen reduction. Alternatively, it can add to carbonyl groups in a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but in this context, since HCN is added, maybe A is a carbonyl compound.

But then, the IR of A is 1750 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So A has a carbonyl group, probably a ketone, as the peak is high, around 1750. If it were an aldehyde, the peak is a bit higher, but maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or something else, but given the product options, perhaps a cyclic ketone.

Next, when A reacts with HCN, it forms B. So perhaps A is a cyclic ketone, and B is a cyanohydrin. Wait, but the product of a ketone reacting with HCN is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group.

But then, after that, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Pd and H2 is hydrogenation. If B has a nitrile group, hydrogenation under palladium would typically reduce the nitrile to an amine. Wait, but wait, no—hydrogenation of nitriles usually requires more specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is converted to an amine, but that might not fit here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps B is an enone, which upon hydrogenation would become a diol or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps A is a cyclic ketone, B is a cyanohydrin (so a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached). Then, B is hydrogenated. But under what conditions? If B has a nitrile and an alcohol group, what happens when you hydrogenate it with H2 and Pd? Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. If Pd is present, maybe it hydrogenates the nitrile group.

Wait, when you hydrogenate a nitrile (R-C≡N) with H2 and a catalyst like palladium (maybe under certain conditions), it reduces the nitrile to an amine (R-CH2-NH2), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, in some cases, nitriles are reduced to alkanes, but that usually requires more vigorous conditions, perhaps with a different catalyst like Raney Ni or LiAlH4. Hmm.

Wait, but looking at the reaction steps again: from B to C is a reduction. So perhaps B has a triple bond or a double bond. Oh wait. Let me think about the possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a ketone with a nitrile group. No, because A is a ketone, and when it reacts with HCN, it's adding HCN to the carbonyl. So maybe A is a cyclic ketone, and B is a secondary
