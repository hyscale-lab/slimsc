Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. They've given me the stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, the stability constant (β) is a measure of the stability of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β1 is the constant for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for the next, maybe [Co(SCN)₂]^, and so on. But wait, the order of β's is β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's interesting because β3 is higher than β2, but β4 is lower. So maybe the complexes are ordered in a way that the third is the most stable, but the fourth isn't as stable as the second?

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I remember that the blue color in the cobalt thiocyanate complexes is typically associated with the tetrahedral [Co(SCN)₄]^3− complex. Oh wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Cobalt can form different colored complexes depending on the number of SCN- ligands. The [Co(SCN)₆]^3− is usually pink, and the dithiocyanato complex, which has two SCN- ions, maybe [Co(SCN)₂]^+? Or is it [Co(SCN)₂]^ something else?

Wait, the blue color is typically for the tetracyanonickelate ion, but in cobalt's case, [Co(SCN)₄]^3− is blue? Or is it [Co(SCN)₂]^+ that's blue? I'm not entirely sure, but I think the question is referring to the dithiocyanato complex, which has two SCN ligands, so that would be [Co(SCN)
