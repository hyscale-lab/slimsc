Alright, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these, so I need to figure out which ones are required.

Wait, let's start by recalling what SMEFT is. SMEFT is an effective theory that encapsulates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry. These operators are organized by their dimension, starting from dimension 6, 7, etc. Each operator is built from the SM fields, and the coefficients are constrained by the SM gauge group.

Now, symmetries in physics are crucial because they determine the form of the laws of nature. The SM, for instance, respects several symmetries like Lorentz symmetry, gauge symmetries, and others. SMEFT being an effective theory should preserve the same symmetries as the SM, except for those that are explicitly broken by the higher-dimensional operators.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must all operators respect. So, SMEFT operators must be compatible with certain symmetries.

Lorentz symmetry is big here. The SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, otherwise, it would break the theory's fundamental structure. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry, translations, and their combinations. But wait, Poincare symmetry isn't just about the local transformations; it's the entire symmetry group of special relativity. But when we talk about symmetries that operators must respect, do they have to be invariant under Poincare transformations, or just Lorentz?

Hmm, operators in the theory are built in a way that's compatible with the Poincare algebra. Wait, but in effective field theories, you often work in a specific frame, like the rest frame, but the operators must still respect the symmetry up to possible explicit terms. Wait a second, the SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators are Lorentz scalars. But Poincare includes translations, so are the operators required to be invariant under translations?

Wait, effective operators are local, so when you write them down, they're local Lorentz scalars. But Poincare includes translations, so each term in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar, right? Because otherwise, you'd have terms that don't respect the overall symmetry of the theory.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are written as local operators, but the full theory is Poincare invariant. So the operators have to be Poincare scalars as well. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry includes translations. The SM is Poincare invariant, so the SMEFT as an effective theory should also respect Poincare symmetry. So operators must be Poincare scalars, so both Lorentz and Poincare are required. So options 1 and 2 must be correct.

Then, what about CP and CPT symmetry? The SM isn't CP symmetric because of the CKM problem, but it
