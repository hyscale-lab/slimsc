Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it involves reagents for certain reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, I think that's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, in ketones, the carbonyl group is attacked by the nucleophile. So in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So when you add a nucleophile like CN- to a ketone, typically you get an addition product, not a substitution. So the product would have the CN attached to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So let me draw that structure. The molecule is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, no. Let me think. The formula for 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? No, wait, let's think about the reaction. When you add NaCN to a ketone, it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is that the ketone would form an enolate under certain conditions, but wait, when you have NaCN and maybe an acid catalyst, perhaps it's a two-step process. Oh wait, in the presence of an acid, maybe the ketone is protonated, making it more electrophilic, and then the CN- attacks.

Wait, but that would give an addition product where the CN is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is now a secondary alcohol after workup. Wait, but the product here is a nitrile attached to the same carbon as the hydroxy group. Wait, but wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see:
