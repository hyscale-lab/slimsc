Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to tackle, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to figure out the structure of the starting material and then determine what the product is after each reaction step.

First, I'll look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, the first peak is a triplet at 9.72. That seems like an aldehyde proton, which typically appears around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the structure. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehydes are usually deshielded and split into a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group? Or maybe it's a conjugated system.

Next, the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks are doublets each integrating to 2H. That makes me think of aromatic protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene ring, the two protons would be equivalent and split into a doublet. Or maybe they're part of a vinyl group.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad signals can indicate exchange with something else, like in an acidic environment. Maybe these are hydroxyl protons, but wait, they're a singlet. Or perhaps they're part of a conjugated system, like allylic protons. Alternatively, they could be adjacent to an oxygen, like in a phenol or an enol.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That could be a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or a CH2 attached to something else, like a carbonyl.

Putting this together, I'm thinking the molecule might have an aldehyde group, an aromatic ring, and some sort of oxygen-containing group. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, formula is C8H9NO. So, substituting: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde (which is a double bond, but maybe counted as part of the carbonyl group). Wait, but the aldehyde is RCHO, which is a double bond (so that's another DoU). So 3 (benzene) +1 (double bond) +1 (aldehyde) = 5. So that adds up.

So, the structure likely has a benzene
