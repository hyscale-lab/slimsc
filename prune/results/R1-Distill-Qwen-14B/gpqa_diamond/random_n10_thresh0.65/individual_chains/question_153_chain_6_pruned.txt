Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? So the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. 

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options given.

Let's start with part A: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile I think. It's a diester, and under basic conditions, it can deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

So the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, wait. No, wait: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the acrylate. Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is attached to the acrylate. Oh wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. The formula is CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the acrylate. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the correct structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Oh, no, wait, the numbering. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is at position 3. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2C6H4-4-CH3? No, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2C6H4-4-CH3? Or maybe it's the p-tolyl group attached to the alpha-beta position, like CH2=C(C6H4-4-CH3)-CO-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2
