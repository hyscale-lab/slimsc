Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read through it carefully and think about how to approach it.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible, so maybe I can ignore any kinetic energy aspects and just focus on potential energy. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. The system's potential energy is the work done to bring the charges together. Since the system is isolated, the energy will be the sum of the potential energies between all pairs.

Let me outline what I know. Each charge is 2e. Let's recall that e is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge q is 2 * 1.602e-19 C, which is about 3.204e-19 C.

There are 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, which is where the 13th charge is located.

Wait, but do the 12 charges form some sort of arrangement? Like, are they all at the same point 2m away from P, or are they arranged in a circle or something? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps all 12 are at a distance of 2m from P, but their arrangement among themselves isn't specified. Hmm, but for the potential energy calculation, maybe it's just the sum of all mutual interactions.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So, maybe it's the potential energy when all the charges are placed in the configuration that gives the minimum (or maximum) potential energy. But wait, for charges of the same sign, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But in this case, the setup is fixed: 12 are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not
