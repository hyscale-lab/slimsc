Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two specific spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, probably looking for exoplanets or studying stellar populations.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with different properties like RA, DEC, magnitudes, distances, and some have extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their apparent brightness. I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

First, I think I should recall the capabilities of each spectrograph. From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, any star with apparent V mag ≤17 is observable. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag, so stars with V mag ≤16 can be observed. So, a star needs to be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, but wait, wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed"—wait, does that mean that ESPRESSO can detect stars down to V=17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is less than 17. So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16, so V≤16.

Wait, no, the question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, if a star's V mag is brighter than 17, meaning V <17, then ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, V mag brighter than 16, so V <16.

Wait, no, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again. The way the question is phrased: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, if a star's V mag is brighter than 17, it's accepted. So, V mag <17. Similarly, for HIRES, V mag <16.

So, for a star to be detectable by both, it must have V mag ≤16 (since HIRES requires brighter than 16, which is V <16), because if a star is V=16.5, then it's fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can since 16.5 <17. So if a star is V=16.5, then it can be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

Wait, no. Let me make a table.

ESPRESSO observes stars with V <17 (brighter than 17 mag)
HIRES observes stars with V <16 (brighter than 16 mag)

So a star that can be detected by both must satisfy V <16. Because if a star has V=15, both can see it. If V=16, HIRES can see it (since 16 <16?), wait
