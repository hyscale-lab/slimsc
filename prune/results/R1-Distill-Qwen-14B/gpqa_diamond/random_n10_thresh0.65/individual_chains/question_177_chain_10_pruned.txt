Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting. Then, through spectroscopy, the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T were different, λ_max would change. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but why does that happen? Because even though their masses and radii are different, they're emitting the same peak wavelength, implying same T. So T1 = T2.

The next part says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight, right. But how does that affect luminosity? Hmm, maybe it's about Doppler shift? Because if a star is moving towards us or away, the observed wavelength would shift. But in this problem, they found the same λ_max through spectroscopy. Oh wait, but maybe the observed wavelengths are shifted due to their velocities, but the actual emission peaks are at the same wavelength. Or perhaps the velocities are given in their rest frames?

Wait, no. Because if the stars are moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would be different. But the problem says they found the same λ_max, so perhaps the velocities are accounted for when determining that λ_max. Or, maybe the velocities are radial, but the λ_max observed is the same. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the velocities affect the observed flux or something else, but perhaps for luminosity calculation, which is intrinsic, the velocities don't matter. Because luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, not the apparent brightness.

Wait, the question says 'assuming the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of...' So the velocities might be a red herring, or perhaps they affect the observed wavelength, but since the peak wavelengths are same, maybe the velocities are causing a shift that is accounted for
