Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the allowed decay products of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. 

The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) [ν + X(y)] ψ_f(y). Wait, no, maybe I should look again. Oh, wait, I think I misread that. The interaction term looks like it's between the boson X and some fermions. The term is -λ f ψ_f bar (y) times (v + X(y)) times ψ_f(y). Oh, right, so it's like a Yukawa coupling. So this means that the boson X is interacting with fermions of type f. 

So the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. Because in Yukawa interactions, the boson couples to two fermions. So the decay products should be pairs like f and f-bar. 

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the possible decays would be into any fermion-antifermion pair where the combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because for a decay to happen, the rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. Let's list them:

- Up quark (u): mass around 2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are super light, but I think they are negligible here.

Wait, but wait.
