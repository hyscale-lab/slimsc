Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit, I think. The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. So, the task is to find the geometrical position of this matrix in the qubits space. The options are given as vectors r with different coordinates.

Wait, what do I know about the Bloch sphere? Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a way to represent the state of a qubit. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1 and be a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But this ρ looks like a mixed state because it's a sum of two projectors, each for |0> and |1>, multiplied by 1/2.

So, for a qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of Bloch vectors. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (probably in 3D since σx, σy, σz are involved). The vector r would be the Bloch vector, which has components (x, y, z). The length of r determines if the state is pure or mixed. If |r|=1, it's pure; else, it's mixed.

Let me compute that. So, given ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write that out in matrix form. |0> is [1; 0], |1> is [0;1]. So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplied by 1/2, we get ρ = (1/2)I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

So, ρ = (I)/2. Now, according to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, this would mean that r·σ is zero because (I/2) is just (I + 0)/2. So r·σ = 0, which implies that r must be the zero vector. Because any non-zero
