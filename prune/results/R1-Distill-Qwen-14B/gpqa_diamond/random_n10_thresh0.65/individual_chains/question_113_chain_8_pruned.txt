Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let's see what I can figure out here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's take it step by step.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four possible chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. 

Let's start by breaking down each piece of data. 

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So that's probably an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. If it's a broad peak, it's more likely an -OH group, like in an alcohol, because carboxylic acids can sometimes show a very broad peak too, but maybe it's stretching. 

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a region where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) show up. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or an amide? Wait, but the options don't include nitrogen, so probably another type of carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: the 1650 could be an absorption from a conjugated carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the possible functional groups. The presence of two strong peaks in the carbonyl region suggests two different carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure if that's possible. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Let me think. For example, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (like a ketone, ester, maybe a carboxylic acid). 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretch) or maybe an amide, but without N, probably not. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl like an enone. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid derivative or an ester. 

Wait, the
