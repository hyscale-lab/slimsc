Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance somehow. Oh right, the parallax of a star is the angle subtended by the star at the two ends of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax (plx), right? So d = 1/plx. 

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, more stars when parallax is smaller, meaning closer stars, and fewer as parallax increases (since they are farther away).

Wait, but how does the number of stars depend on the range of parallax? Let's think. The number of stars within a certain distance depends on the volume, since stars are uniformly distributed. Oh, yeah, the number of stars in a spherical shell between d and d+Δd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is about 4πd² Δd. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d².

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Since plx is 1/d, a small change in plx would correspond to a change in distance. Let me think about how d and plx relate. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So if I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, I can find the corresponding distance range.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the change in the number of stars per unit of plx. Let's think of
