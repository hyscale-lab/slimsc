Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, another possibility is that it's a dehydrohalogenation or maybe a substitution reaction. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are used in the elimination of HX, especially when dealing with something like a vicinal dihalide. Oh wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I think that when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it can lead to the formation of an imine or maybe a different kind of reaction. Hmm, maybe I should first figure out what compound X is from the spectral data.

So, the IR data is given. Let's look at those peaks. The IR shows strong absorption between 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. That's usually indicative of O-H or N-H stretching. But since the compound is reacting with HI and phosphorus, maybe it's an alcohol or something else. Wait, but the other peaks include 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak, probably a ketone (around 1700-1750) or maybe an ester or aldehyde. The 1610 and 1450 cm-
