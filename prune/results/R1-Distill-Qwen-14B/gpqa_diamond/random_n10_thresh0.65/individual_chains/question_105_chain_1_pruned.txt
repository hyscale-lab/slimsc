Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how it relates to an exoplanet causing brightness variations. Interesting.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is 1 R_sun. The spots are on one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Oh wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered in spots. So 20% of half the star's surface is covered. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing periodic brightness changes. But the problem says that this setup can look like an exoplanet causing the same brightness variations. So we need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the spots, assuming no spots (so comparing the two scenarios).

Wait, the question is asking: what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots? So I need to calculate the relative radius Rpl/Rstar.

First, I should think about how both the spots and the planet affect the brightness.

When a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness (the dip) is proportional to the area of the planet compared to the star. The area is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, because area scales with the square of radius.

But in the case of the star spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler regions. So when the spots are facing us (as the star rotates), they reduce the overall brightness because they emit less light. So the observed brightness variation is due to the change in the amount of light blocked as the spots rotate in and out of view.

Wait, but wait. No, actually, the spots are on the surface, so when the star rotates such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total emitted light is less. But how does that translate into the amplitude of the brightness variation?

Alternatively, perhaps we should model the brightness variation caused by the spots as a decrease in flux when the spots are visible. So the total flux from the star is F = F0 * (1 - Filling Factor * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4)) ). Because each spot is cooler, so their contribution to the flux is less.

Wait, no, not exactly. The flux from the star is the sum
