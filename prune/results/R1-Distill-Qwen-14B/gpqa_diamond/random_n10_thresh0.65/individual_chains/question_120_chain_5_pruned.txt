Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I'm supposed to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Oh right, parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So a star at a larger distance has a smaller parallax. So plx = 1/distance (in some units, but the exact units don't matter for this question).

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what way? Oh, I think that means their spatial density is uniform. So in any volume of space, the number of stars is the same. So the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I need to find how the number of stars in a thin slice of plx (like between plx and plx + dplx) relates to plx.

Let me break it down. Parallax is inversely related to distance. So if I have a parallax value plx, the corresponding distance is d = 1/plx (again, considering units where the constant of proportionality is 1 for simplicity). 

The next step is to think about how the volume in space relates to a given parallax range. Since parallax decreases as distance increases, a small change in plx corresponds to a larger change in distance at larger distances. 

So, suppose I have a parallax plx. The distance is d = 1/plx. If I consider a small change in parallax, dplx, this will correspond to a change in distance dd. How? Let's see: plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, but we're interested in the magnitude here. So, the volume element in spherical shells (since we're considering all directions) would be 4π d² dd, right?

Wait, but we're looking for the number of stars in a range of plx. So for a given plx, the corresponding distance is d = 1/plx. The next part is to find the volume between plx and plx + dplx, which translates to distances from d to d + dd. But wait,
