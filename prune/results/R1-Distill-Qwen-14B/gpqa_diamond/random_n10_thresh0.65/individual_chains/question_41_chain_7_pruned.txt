Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a moving medium, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Hmm. I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the glass itself is moving, so does that affect how we perceive the speed of the light? Oh, right, because the glass is moving, we might need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity, but wait, is that necessary here?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n. But if the medium itself is moving, I think the speed of light in that medium as observed in the lab frame would depend on the relative motion between the medium and the observer. But wait, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the glass's velocity is v, same direction as the light beam, and toward the observer. Wait, no—wait, the glass is moving toward the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Or is the glass moving toward the observer while the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion?

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, no—wait, same direction as the beam, and toward the observer? That sounds conflicting. Oh
