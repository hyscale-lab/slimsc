Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

So, the question is about a star with certain properties and how dark spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, their overall brightness can change, but how does that affect the line ratios? Wait, this is about LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. That means each region emits based on its local temperature.

The star's parameters: 1.5 solar radii, 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? Because spots are cooler regions, so the star's average temperature decreases. But how do they calculate the effective temperature when part of the surface is cooler? Oh right, the effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity and radius.

But the problem isn't directly about luminosity; it's about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the ratio goes down. I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in levels 1 and 2. In LTE, the ratio should follow the
