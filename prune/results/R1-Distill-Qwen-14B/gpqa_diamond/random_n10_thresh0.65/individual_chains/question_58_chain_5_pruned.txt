Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory doesn't need regularization. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those pesky infinities that pop up in calculations. I remember that regularization helps make these infinities manageable so that you can subtract them or renormalize the theory.

Let's look at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory that includes supersymmetry. I think string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories do. Because strings are extended objects, maybe the calculations don't lead to the same divergences. So superstring theory might not require regularization because it's already finite.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD does require regularization because it deals with things like the running of coupling constants and issues with renormalization. Also, QCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory, which can have more complex divergences. So they probably use things like lattice regularization or other methods to handle the infinities.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED does require regularization. The famous example is the calculation of the electron's mass and charge, which leads to infinities. These are handled through renormalization, so regularization must be a part of QED's process.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't involve quantum aspects, so they don't have the same divergences that quantum theories do. In classical electrodynamics, like Maxwell's equations, there are no infinities because they're just classical fields. So regularization, which is a quantum concept, wouldn't be needed here.

So putting it all together. The question is which theory never requires regularization. Regularization is a tool in quantum field theories to handle divergences. If a theory doesn't have such divergences, it won't need regularization.

Superstring Theory (A) is a quantum theory but is supposed to be finite, so maybe it doesn't require regularization. But wait, I'm not sure. Do string theories actually avoid all divergences? I think they might require some form of regularization or maybe have their own ways of handling things, but perhaps they don't need it in the same way as QED or QCD.

Wait, but the question is about whether it "never" requires regularization. So if a theory doesn't have divergences, it doesn't need regularization. Superstring theory is a candidate because it's a theory that's supposed to be free from divergences. Because strings have a different structure than point particles, maybe the divergences don't appear.

On the other hand, classical electrodynamics (D) definitely doesn't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But the question is about high energies. Wait a minute, what happens when you go to high energies in classical theories? Electromagnetism at high energies is still classical, but when you go to very short distances (high energies), the classical theory breaks down, and you need quantum mechanics. But the question is about whether the theory
