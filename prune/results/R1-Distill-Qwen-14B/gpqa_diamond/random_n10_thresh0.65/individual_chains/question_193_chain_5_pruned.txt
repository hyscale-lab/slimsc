Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, based on the observed relationship between the number of stars and parallax. The specific relationship given is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by plx to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. 

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in parsecs. So d ≈ 1/plx. Wait, let me think, if plx is in arcseconds, then d in parsecs is 1 over plx. Right, so plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. 

But the question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance. So they're relating N to parallax as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since I know plx is inversely proportional to distance, I can express plx in terms of d. 

Let me write that down. Since plx = 1/d, substituting into the equation: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so 1/(that) would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5. 

Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, for a small change in distance, how does N change? I think this is about the derivative of N with respect to d. 

If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dd would be proportional to 5d^4. But wait, the question is about per unit range of distance r. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, maybe the way to approach this is to consider the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of that shell would be approximately 4πd² dr. But wait, wait, the number of stars depends on how many there are per unit volume, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. 

Wait, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional
