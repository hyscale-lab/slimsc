Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, sounds a bit challenging, but I'll take it slowly.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, right, the formula is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, X (halogens) is 0, and N is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So DoU is 5. That could be from a ring and some double bonds. Maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents and a double bond elsewhere.

Looking at the NMR data: 

1H-NMR (ppm):
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me analyze each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That sounds like an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as singlets or triplets if coupled. The triplet suggests that the aldehyde proton is adjacent to another proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually at the end, so maybe it's part of a conjugated system? Alternatively, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Hmm.

Next, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm peaks are doublets, each integrating to 2H. These could be aromatic protons. The 6.98 is more downfield, so maybe para-substituted phenyl rings. Oh, wait, but the two doublets could be from a pair of para-substituted aromatic rings, like a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Each as a doublet suggests coupling with two protons. Alternatively, maybe each is part of a meta coupling, but more likely para.

The 6.27 ppm
