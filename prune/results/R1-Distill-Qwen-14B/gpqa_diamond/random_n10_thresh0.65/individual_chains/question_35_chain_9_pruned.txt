Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y. They represent it as a 2x2 matrix A_y, which is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π). Oh wait, S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to write down what S looks like.

Let me write S as:
S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

So A_y is c multiplied by this matrix. Since c is h/(4π), that's A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, the problem is asking me to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. And then look at which statement among the options is correct.

So first, probably I should find the eigenvalues of A_y. Eigenvalues come from the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0.

But wait, since A_y is a multiple of S, maybe I can find the eigenvalues of S first and then scale them by c.

Because if S has eigenvalues λ_s, then A_y will have eigenvalues c * λ_s.

So let's find the eigenvalues of S. The matrix S is:
[0  -i]
[i  0]

The trace of S is 0 + 0 = 0, so sum of eigenvalues is 0.

The determinant of S is (0
