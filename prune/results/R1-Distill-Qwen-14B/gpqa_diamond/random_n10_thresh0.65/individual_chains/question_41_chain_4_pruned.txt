Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam propagating through glass with a refractive index n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c divided by the refractive index. Oh wait, but c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is given here as 1. So the speed of light in the glass would be 1/n, right? But wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass. But the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed according to the lab frame?

Wait, this seems like a problem involving special relativity. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, velocities add according to the rules of special relativity, not just linearly. Oh wait, but light's speed is always c in any inertial frame. Or wait, is that the case?

Wait no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think. In a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But here, the light is in a medium (glass) which is moving.

Wait, but in the glass, the speed of light is v_glass = c/n, which is 1/n since c=1. But when the glass is moving, how does
