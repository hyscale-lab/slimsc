Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The problem is about a bosonic field X interacting with fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I'm not entirely sure I parse that correctly. Oh, right, the interaction term is probably something like λ times the fields. But maybe I don't need to focus too much on the Lagrangian's specifics except for understanding the interaction type.

The key point is that the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV, and the question is about its kinematically allowed decays. So I need to consider which fermions X can decay into.

From what I remember, a boson's decay into fermions depends on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it's decaying into. The rule is that the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson. Also, because fermions are involved, there's a spin consideration—fermions have half-integer spin, and bosons have integer spin. But for decay kinematics, it's about the masses.

Wait, another thing: in the Standard Model, the Yukawa coupling determines the strength of the interaction between a boson (like the Higgs) and fermions. So, if X is a boson with a coupling to various fermions, the decay modes are determined by whether the fermion masses are less than half the X mass. Because for a decay into two particles, each must have energy at least their rest mass. So the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of X.

Wait, but for two-body decay, each fermion's mass must be less than the X boson's mass divided by 2. Because each fermion gets at least its rest mass energy, and they're produced in pairs (like f and f-bar). So the condition is 2m_f < m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So m_f must be less than 3 GeV.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions. The up and down quarks are the lightest, but their exact masses are tricky because they're part of the same multiplet and depend on things like confinement. But for the sake of this problem, I'll consider the approximate masses.

Electron mass is about 0.0005 GeV. Muon is around 0.1 GeV. Tau is about 1.78 GeV. The quarks: u and d are around 2-5 MeV each (so much less than 3 GeV). The strange quark is about 100 MeV. The charm quark is about 1.27 GeV. The bottom is around 4.5 GeV. Top is way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

Wait, let's get exact numbers. Let me think:

- Electron (e): ~0.000511 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.1057 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up (u): ~1.5 MeV (so 0.0015 GeV)
- Down (d): ~3 MeV (0.003 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (let's say ~4.7 GeV)
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

So, for each fermion pair (like e+ e-), the sum is 2 * m_f. So for each possible pair:

Electron pair: 2 * 0.0005 ≈ 0.001 GeV < 6 GeV. So allowed.
Muon pair: 2 * 0.1057 ≈ 0.
