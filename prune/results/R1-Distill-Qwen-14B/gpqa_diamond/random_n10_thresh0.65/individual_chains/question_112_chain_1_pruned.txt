Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that there's an electron state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, S_z, I think. Right, because spin-up and spin-down states along z.

First, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The matrix elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Then, I also have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Wait, what's the matrix for A? Let me think. The matrix is 2x2 because we're talking about spin-1/2 particles, so two states. So, the matrix A would look like this:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because when i != j, Aij is ħ/2, else zero. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. That looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix times ħ/2. Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

But wait, what are the eigenstates of this operator A? Because the question is about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So, the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σ_x, I think. Because A is a scalar multiple of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2. So, these are the eigenstates of A as well.

Wait, so to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. The probability in each eigenstate will be the square of the absolute value of the coefficient.

But first, let me normalize |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, let me compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha
