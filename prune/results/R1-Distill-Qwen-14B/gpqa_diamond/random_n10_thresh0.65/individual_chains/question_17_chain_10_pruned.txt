Okay, so I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability constant (K) is given here as 5x10^10. 

Wait, what's the formula for this? Oh right, the stability constant K is the product of the concentrations of the complex and the ions it's binding, divided by the product of the ions' concentrations before complexation. So for Ca-EDTA, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. 

The stability constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this case, we're given that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. 

But wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, right? So when it complexes with Ca²+, it forms a 1:1 complex. So each mole of CaEDTA^2- corresponds to one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. 

Wait, no, because the complex is Ca-EDTA, so in solution, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Now, because K is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be
