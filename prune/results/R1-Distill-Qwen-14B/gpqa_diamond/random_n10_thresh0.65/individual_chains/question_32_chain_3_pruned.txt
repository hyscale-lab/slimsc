Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a certain nucleus. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that a nucleus X, which is Li with 3 neutrons, moves at 0.96c. Wait, Li with 3 neutrons—so Li normally has 3 protons. The isotope would be Li-6, right? Because Li has atomic number 3, so 6 nucleons in total (3 protons and 3 neutrons). So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that the energy in a collider is relativistic, so we'll need to use the equations from special relativity. The main formula I think I need is the total energy of a particle, which is gamma multiplied by its rest mass energy.

The total energy E = gamma * m0c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Given that v is 0.96c, so I can plug that into the gamma equation. Let me calculate gamma first.

So v = 0.96c. Then v² = (0.96c)² = 0.9216 c².

Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I think the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is similar, around 939 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), so m0 = 6 * 938 MeV/c² approximately. Wait, wait, but protons and neutrons have slightly different masses. Let me think—proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But wait, for a nucleus, the mass is actually a bit less than the sum because of binding energy and all, but since the question doesn't give any specific mass, maybe we're supposed to just use the sum of the individual nucleons' rest masses. Or perhaps use the atomic mass.

Wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (u). To convert that to MeV, I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c².

So m0 = 6.013 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ let's calculate that.

6.013 * 931.5 ≈ Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589, 0.013 * 931.5 ≈ about 12.1095. So total around 5601.1095 MeV, which is about 5.6011 GeV. Wait, 5601.1 MeV is 5.6011 GeV.

Wait, but wait, when dealing with nuclei, the actual rest mass is slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons because of the mass defect due to binding energy. So the rest mass of Li-6 is less than 6 * average nucleon mass. Wait, but the problem doesn't give any specific data, so maybe they just expect us to use the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Or the question might
