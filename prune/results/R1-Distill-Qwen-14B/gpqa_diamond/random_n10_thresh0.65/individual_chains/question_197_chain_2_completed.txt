Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but wait, no, actually, I think that's for the treatment of alkyl halides to form alcohols. Alternatively, when compounds have certain functional groups, these reagents might be involved in elimination or substitution reactions. Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the substitution of the hydroxyl group in something like a hydroxyl group adjacent to a carbonyl. Oh right, like in the formation of an alcohol from an acid chloride, but I might be mixing things up.

Anyway, looking at the data for Compound X. The IR and NMR data are provided. I'll start by analyzing those to figure out what X is.

Let's look at the IR spectrum. The peaks are 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad range suggests maybe an O-H stretch. The 1720 cm-1 peak is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So that suggests an aromatic ring. The 1720 could also be an ester or a ketone.

Now the NMR. The peaks are as follows:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a high chemical shift. Could that be an aldehyde proton? No, aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12. The broad signal suggests maybe exchange, like in an -OH group, but if it's a carboxylic acid, that would be more like a broad peak because of the acidity and possible hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, an aldehyde is less likely because those are usually sharp, but wait, the integration is 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be a broad singlet. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

But wait, the IR also shows a peak at 1720, which could correspond to a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which fits. So perhaps X has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but the NMR at 10.5 ppm is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. More typical is around 12 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but 10.5 might be a bit high. Or perhaps it's an acidic proton like from an enol structure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aminol or something else.

Let me think about the other peaks. 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene. The doublets suggest coupling with each other. So if it's a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are in the para positions. The integration is 2H each, so perhaps two sets of protons on the aromatic ring, each as doublets. That would fit a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. Wait, no, if it's a monosubstituted benzene, the coupling would give more splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-dihydroxybenzene or something else. Wait, no, the substituents here might be something else.

Wait, 8.0 and 7.2 ppm for two doublets each integrating to 2H. So maybe it's a para-disubstituted benzene, like a substituent in the para position that causes the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. For example, a substituent like a methyl group or something else, but that doesn't make sense because that would typically cause more complex splitting. Alternatively, it's a para-substituted benzene where the substituent is another group that causes each set of protons to couple. Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the ortho positions? Or maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where each substituent is in the para position relative to each other, but that's not possible. Hmm, I might be getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the two protons are in a meta arrangement. No, because the coupling for each would be different. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene, like two substituents on adjacent carbons (ortho) but that would cause more splitting. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is such that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For instance, if the substituent is in the para position, and the ring has two protons each in the ortho and meta positions relative to the substituent. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent that's on a ring and causes the ring to have two doublets. Hmm, wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group. Let me think about that.

Wait, the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps the substituent is a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a broad O-H stretch as well, which is in the 3400-2500 region. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached. Then, the NMR would have the aromatic protons split into two doublets, meaning the substituent is at the para position, and the ring has two sets of protons each as doublets.

Wait, for example, if the substituent is at position 4 of the benzene, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be equivalent? No, wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are in the ortho and meta positions relative to the substituent. So the protons adjacent to the substituent (ortho) would be one set, and the protons two positions away (meta) would be another set. Each of these would be split into doublets due to coupling with each other.

But wait, if the substituent is a group like -COOH, then the ring's protons would be influenced. Let me think of para-substituted benzoic acid. For example, 4-methylbenzoic acid. But in that case, the aromatic protons would be split into more complex patterns. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester or a ketone.

Wait, let me look at the other NMR peaks. There's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The 1.4 ppm with a doublet (d) and 3H suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm triplet (t) with 3H is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2. So maybe this is a butyl group? Let's think.

Looking at the 2.9 ppm multiplet for 1H, that could be a methine (CH) group adjacent to other groups. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to the CH. So putting that together, the structure might have a CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3) group or something similar.

Wait, the 0.9 triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, a triplet for 3H would be a CH3 connected to a CH2. So for example, the structure could be (CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH(CH3)... No, perhaps it's a butyl group attached to a CH. Let me try to build this.

So, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m). The CH2 attached to the CH could be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). Then, the CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is attached to the CH2. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3 connected via a chain.

Wait, perhaps it's like this: The CH is connected to a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. So that would be a pentyl group? Wait, no. Let me think, the 1.7 ppm is 2H, which is a CH2 group. So maybe the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3). Wait, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's an isobutyl group?

Wait, an isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, actually, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the substituents mixed up.

Wait, let me try to sketch this. The NMR shows 0.9 (t, 3H), so that's a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, a triplet at 0.9 ppm is a CH3 connected to a CH2. Then the 1.7 ppm is two H's, perhaps a CH2 connected to the CH and something else. So the chain is:

CH2CH2CH3 (the 0.9 triplet) connected via a CH2 to a CH, which is at 2.9 ppm. Then, the CH is connected to a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d), which would be the -CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, so the structure from the CH would be: CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3?

Wait, that would make it a pentyl group attached as a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group. Let me recount the integration:

The 0.9 triplet is 3H, which is a CH3.

The 1.7 multiplet is 2H, which is a CH2.

The 2.9 multiplet is 1H, which is a CH.

The 1.4 doublet is 3H, which is another CH3 attached to the CH.

So the structure is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, that would be a pentyl group attached to the CH.

Wait, let me think again. The CH is connected to two groups: a CH3 (the 1.4 ppm d) and a CH2CH2CH2CH3 (from the 0.9 triplet). So the structure would be CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. But wait, that would make the chain longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. So the group is a pentyl substituent on a CH.

But wait, the total number of carbons would be 5 (from the pentyl) plus the CH and CH3. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the substituent is a butyl group, perhaps an isobutyl or a sec-butyl.

An isobutyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me see. The NMR would then have the isobutyl's CH2 groups. The CH(CH2CH3) would be a triplet or something else. Hmm, perhaps not matching.

Alternatively, a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the structure is more accurately CH2CH2CH(CH3). No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me think about the substituent. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. Then, the CH is next to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), which is next to another CH2 (perhaps the 0.9 triplet is from a CH2CH2CH3 group). So the chain would be like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, that's a pentyl group, but where's the substitution? Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 attached to a benzene ring. So the benzene would have a substituent at the para position which is a pentyl group? That seems a bit long, but perhaps.

Wait, but let's think about the IR again. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. So if X has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR has a proton at 10.5 ppm. If that's a carboxylic acid, then it would have a COOH group. But then, the IR would show a strong O-H stretch as well, which it does (3400–2500 cm-1). So that fits. So X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a substituent which is a pentyl group or something similar.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene could be an alkyl chain. So the structure is probably para-substituted with a carboxylic acid and another substituent, which is an alkyl group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. If the substituent is a carboxylic acid in the para position, then the aromatic protons would be at ortho and meta positions. Let's say the substituent is at position 4. Then, the H's at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho, and positions 3 and 5 would be meta. Each of these would have coupling with each other and perhaps with substituents.

Wait, in para-substituted benzoic acid, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be equivalent and give a doublet. The meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be equivalent and also give a doublet. That would fit the NMR data: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So the substituent is a -COOH group at position 4. Then, where is the other substituent?

Wait, no, the NMR shows that the aromatic protons are in two doublets, which would be the case if the substituent is in the para position, and the ring has two sets of equivalent protons each as doublets. So that would fit a monosubstituted benzene with a substituent that's in the para position. But the IR shows a carbonyl group, so perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the integration in the NMR is for 1H at 10.5 ppm. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would be the -OH proton, but wait, carboxylic acids typically have a broad peak around 12 ppm. However, in some cases, the -OH might exchange and appear at lower ppm. Alternatively, perhaps X has an aldehyde group, but that's less likely because aldehydes usually have a peak around 9-10 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm peak is a carbonyl group. Wait, no, that's for protons.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm proton could be an enol proton, but that would typically be in a more deshielded environment. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an aromatic ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, such as a ketone. Then, the substituent would be a ketone, like a benzophenone structure. But then, the IR would show a strong carbonyl, which it does, and the NMR would show the carbonyl group as a singlet.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) and the other peaks suggest branching, which might indicate an isopropyl or similar group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester or a ketone attached to an alkyl chain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative with an alkyl chain. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to put it all together.

So, the aromatic ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group (from IR) and another substituent which is an alkyl group. The substituents are in the para positions relative to each other.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are in two doublets, which would occur if the substituents are in the para position. So, the ring is para-substituted with two groups: one being a carbonyl group (like -COOH or -COOR), and the other being an alkyl chain.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, which suggests it's not split by any neighboring protons. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is usually broad, but perhaps it's exchanged or in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton, but that would require the compound to have an aldehyde group, which doesn't fit the IR data of a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is a vinylic or aromatic proton. No, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2. So perhaps the 10.5 is another functional group.

Wait, let me think about the options given. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Let me analyze that structure. Benzoic acid has a -COOH group at position 1. The substituent at position 4 would be a sec-butyl group.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So, attached to the benzene ring at position 4, we have a sec-butyl group.

So the structure would be:

Phenyl ring with -COOH at position 1 and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group at position 4.

Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is attached via the CH2 group. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), which is a four-carbon chain with a branch.

Let me think about the NMR for this structure.

The aromatic protons: in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4 (para). The remaining protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. These would be two sets of doublets: positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 would be meta. So the ortho protons would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than the meta. So the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the ortho protons, and 7.2 (d, 2H) would be the meta. That fits the NMR data.

The -COOH group would have a proton in the NMR. But in the NMR data, there's a 10.5 ppm singlet for 1H. Benzoic acid's -COOH would typically have a proton around 12 ppm, but maybe it's exchanged and appears downfield. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different functional group.

The other part of the molecule is the sec-butyl group. The structure is:

Ph–COOH

Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)– (at para position)

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2CH(CH2CH3).

The NMR would then show the protons from the substituent.

The substituent's structure is:

CH2–CH(CH2CH3)

So the CH(CH2CH3) group is connected to the CH2 which is attached to the benzene ring.

In the NMR, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a proton. The CH2 group attached to the benzene would have two protons. The CH2CH3 group would have three protons.

Looking at the substituent's NMR:

The CH(CH2CH3) would be a CH with two substituents: one CH2 and one CH2CH3. This CH would be split based on the neighboring groups.

Wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the CH2 group is between the benzene and the CH. The CH has two substituents: the CH2 and the CH2CH3.

The CH would be a methine (CH) group, which has one proton. The CH2 group (attached to the benzene) would have two protons. The CH2CH3 group has three protons.

Now, in the NMR:

The CH (from the substituent) would be around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The CH2 attached to the benzene would be around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH2CH3 would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) for the CH3 attached to the CH, and the other CH3 from the substituent would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), perhaps? Wait, no, the CH2CH3 would be a triplet somewhere else.

Wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So:

- The CH2 near the benzene would have two H's, possibly as a triplet or multiplet. The CH (middle) has one H, and the CH2CH3 has three H's, which would be a triplet around 0.9 ppm.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H). That would correspond to the CH2CH3 group's CH3. The CH2 attached to the benzene would be around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH in the middle is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The CH3 attached to the CH (if any) would be at 1.4 ppm. Wait, but in this structure, the CH is connected to a CH2CH3 and a CH2Ph. So the CH has two CH2 groups attached to it. The CH3 from the CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet (since it's attached to a CH2 group, which has two H's, hence triplet). The CH2Ph (attached to the benzene) would be next to the CH, which has 1 H, so perhaps it's a multiplet around 1.7 ppm. The CH itself is at 2.9 ppm.

Wait, but according to the NMR data, there's a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH. In the substituent, the CH has a CH2CH3 and a CH2Ph. So the CH3 of CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm, and the CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm. Then, where does the 1.4 ppm come from? Oh, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the CH group has a CH3 attached directly. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a different branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group: CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2Ph? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: maybe the substituent is a pentyl group with branching. Let me think of the substituent as CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH2CH3. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group. But the NMR doesn't seem to fit that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4. Let's see if the NMR matches that.

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent's structure is:

Ph-COOH (at position 1)
Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3) (at position 4)

So the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH2 group (between Ph and CH) has 2 H's as a quartet, perhaps, due to coupling with the CH and the adjacent group.

Wait, no, the CH is connected to both the CH2 and the CH2CH3. The CH2 (attached to Ph) would be next to the CH, which has 1 H. So the CH2 would be a triplet, but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet with 2 H's. The CH would be a triplet, but it's a singlet or multiplet in the NMR.

The CH2CH3 would be a triplet at around 0.9 ppm.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d) for 3 H's, which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is not a sec-butyl group but a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, that would be a neopentyl group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me instead look at the options again and see which one fits the NMR and IR.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In this structure, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4. The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). The -CH2- group is attached to the ring, then a -CH(CH2CH3) group.

In the NMR, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a proton as a triplet or multiplet. The CH2 attached to the ring would have two protons as a quartet, perhaps.

Wait, but according to the NMR data:

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): could be the CH3 attached to the CH in the substituent.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): the CH in the substituent.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): the CH2 attached to the ring.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): the CH2CH3 group.

So for the substituent:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (1.7 ppm, 2H) is a CH2 connected to the CH.

- The CH (2.9 ppm, 1H) is connected to the CH2 and the CH2CH3.

- The CH2CH3 group (0.9 ppm, t) is the terminal CH3.

Additionally, the CH has a CH3 attached, which is at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). Wait, but in a sec-butyl group, the CH doesn't have a CH3 attached. The structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the CH is connected to a CH2 and a CH2CH3. So the CH3 would be at the end of the CH2CH3. Therefore, the 1.4 ppm (d) doesn't fit this scenario. So perhaps the substituent is not a sec-butyl group.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the NMR again. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. If the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group, perhaps as part of a longer chain.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. For example, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then:

- The CH(CH3) would have the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) CH3.

- The CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H).

- The terminal CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

So the substituent would be a 3-pentyl group with a branch at the CH(CH3). That would fit the NMR data.

So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group attached to the benzene at the para position, along with a -COOH group.

But then, which option matches this structure?

Looking back, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is a four-carbon substituent. But in our case, the substituent is a five-carbon group. So perhaps none of the options match. Hmm, but the given options don't include a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the NMR data.

The substituent's NMR:

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): CH3 attached to a CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): CH2 group.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): CH2CH3.

So the substituent is a group like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that would require more protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. No, that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch. The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group. But that's also known as a neopentyl group? Or perhaps it's an isobutyl group.

Wait, an isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's a different structure.

Wait, the substituent is:

Ph—COOH (position 1)

Ph—CH2—CH(CH3)—CH2—CH2CH3 (position 4)

No, that's getting too complicated. Maybe it's a pentyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group.

So, let me think of the substituent as -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3). But that would have a different NMR signature.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group, which is an isopropyl group attached via a CH2. But that doesn't fit all the NMR data.

Another approach: let's consider the options. We have option C as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would be:

Ph-COOH (para to the substituent)

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

In this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH2 group attached to the benzene: two H's.

- The CH group: one H.

- The CH2CH3 group: three H's.

In the NMR:

- The CH2 attached to benzene would be next to the CH, which has one H, so it's a triplet or quartet. The NMR shows this as 1.7 ppm (m,2H), which could be a triplet.

- The CH group is connected to two groups: CH2 and CH2CH3. So the H on CH would be a triplet as well, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2CH3 group would have three H's as a triplet around 0.9 ppm.

But in the NMR, we have a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is a CH3 attached to a CH. This doesn't fit the substituent structure for option C, because in option C, the CH doesn't have a CH3 attached to it; the substituent's CH has a CH2CH3 and a CH2Ph.

Therefore, perhaps option C is not the correct structure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let's think about that.

An isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the substituent's NMR would have:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: 2 H's.

- The CH attached to two CH3 groups: 1 H.

- The two CH3 groups on the CH: 6 H's in total, but in the NMR, we have 0.9 triplet for 3 H's.

Wait, but the NMR has a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH. If the substituent is an isobutyl group, the CH would have two CH3 groups, each as a singlet.

But the NMR data shows a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which would not fit an isobutyl group, since the isobutyl group's CH3 would be at around 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

So perhaps the substituent isn't an isobutyl group either.

Wait, another option is that the substituent is a t-butyl group, but that would have a singlet for the CH3 groups, which doesn't match the NMR.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let's think about the NMR of that.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So the substituent's structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

In the NMR, the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene: 2 H's, likely a quartet because adjacent to a CH with one H.

- The CH in the middle: 1 H, which would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH2 group).

- The CH2CH3 group: 3 H's, triplet around 0.9 ppm.

In the given NMR data:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): matches the CH2CH3.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): matches the CH2 attached to the ring.

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): matches the CH.

But the NMR also has a peak at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH. In the substituent for option C, there's no such CH3 attached. So this suggests that option C might not be correct.

Wait, unless I'm missing something. Perhaps the substituent is a different structure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch, such as a 2-pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tertiary butyl group.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option C. Let me try to see.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the NMR would have:

- CH2 (2H) at ~1.7 ppm.

- CH (1H) at ~2.9 ppm.

- CH2CH3 (3H) at ~0.9 ppm.

But the NMR also has a CH3 at 1.4 ppm, but that's not part of the sec-butyl group. So this doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch, leading to a CH3 at 1.4 ppm. For example, a substituent like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3.

In this case, the substituent would have:

- CH(CH3) (1H, at 2.9 ppm)

- CH2 (2H) next to CH (at 1.7 ppm)

- CH2 (2H) next to that (but which peak is that?)

Wait, but the NMR data only shows 1.7 ppm (2H) and 0.9 ppm (3H). So perhaps the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, but that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck, but maybe I should proceed to the reaction part. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I think this is a reaction known as the Wurtz reaction, which is the coupling of alkyl halides. But wait, Wurtz reaction requires two alkyl halides. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides to form alcohols. Wait, no, more accurately, it's used for converting alkyl halides to alkanes via dehydrohalogenation and elimination. Wait, no, I'm mixing up reactions.

Wait, another reaction involving red phosphorus and HI is the use for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride. For example, an acid chloride (like RCOCl) reacts with red phosphorus and water to form the carboxylic acid. But wait, red phosphorus and HI are more commonly used in the formation of alkanes from alkyl halides, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. Wait, if X is a benzophenone derivative, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the elimination of HI from an alkyl iodide. So if X has an adjacent leaving group, it could undergo elimination to form an alkene. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but in the case where X has a good leaving group like a tosylate or mesylate, then reaction with HI might lead to substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a nucleophilic substitution. If X has a good leaving group attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group, then perhaps the substitution occurs, leading to a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option's reaction.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, benzoic acid doesn't have a leaving group. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester or an acid chloride. But in the options, option C is a benzoic acid.

Wait, maybe X is an acid chloride. Then, red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to the carboxylic acid. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is an alkyl iodide substituted on the benzene ring. So, for example, if X is an aryl iodide, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the question says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Another possibility is that X is a nitrile. But none of the options suggest that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is an epoxide, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent on the benzene is an alkyl iodide. So, for example, if X is 4-iodo-benzoic acid, then reaction with red phosphorus and HI would form 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution. If X is an acid chloride, reacting with HI (a nucleophile) would substitute the chloride with iodide, but that doesn't seem to fit the options.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the NMR and IR data.

Given the NMR data, the aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (from IR), and the other is an alkyl group.

The substituent with the alkyl group shows a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d), which is attached to a CH (2.9 ppm). The CH is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm), which is connected to a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm). So the substituent is a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, that would make it a pentyl group, but the CH(CH3) is part of the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, but that seems too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a secondary butyl group, i.e., a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of the options again.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Let's see if the NMR data fits this.

For the substituent:

- CH2 (attached to ring): 2H, around 1.7 ppm (m).

- CH (middle): 1H, around 2.9 ppm (m).

- CH2CH3: 3H, around 0.9 ppm (t).

But the NMR also has a peak at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which would correspond to a CH3 attached to a CH. But in the substituent of option C, there's no CH3 attached to the CH; the CH is attached to a CH2Ph and a CH2CH3.

Therefore, option C's substituent wouldn't have a CH3 at 1.4 ppm. So perhaps the correct substituent in X is different.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary butyl group. A tertiary butyl group is -(CH2)C(CH3)3. But that would give a singlet for the CH3 groups, which doesn't match the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a neopentyl group, but that also wouldn't fit.

I'm stuck, but perhaps I should proceed with the best possible fit. The aromatic data matches option C, but the substituent's NMR doesn't. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the substituent's NMR.

Wait, perhaps the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) isn't part of the substituent but is from another part of the molecule. But in this case, the only other group would be the -COOH.

Wait, another possibility: the 1.4 ppm is the methyl group from an acetic acid group. No, because acetic acid would have different NMR characteristics.

Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the correct structure is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, despite the substituent's NMR not matching perfectly. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in X is a pentyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a longer chain, and the NMR would have more peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let's see:

- The CH(CH3) would have 1H at 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2 attached to ring would be 2H at 1.7 ppm.

- The CH2CH3 at the end would be 3H at 0.9 ppm.

- The CH3 attached to CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d).

Yes, this fits the NMR data.

So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

That's a 3-pentyl group with a branch. So the substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch at the second carbon.

So the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group. The structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a 3-methylpentyl group. Hmm.

If the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, then the NMR would show:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): the terminal CH2CH3.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): the CH3 attached to the CH.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): the CH2 groups.

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): the CH.

So this would match the NMR data.

But none of the options mention a pentyl group. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

In this structure, the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH2 attached to benzene: 2H, likely as a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH's 1H).

- The CH in the middle: 1H, as a triplet (coupled with the CH2 and the CH2CH3).

- The CH2CH3: 3H, as a triplet.

But the NMR has a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH. In option C, the substituent's CH doesn't have a CH3 attached; instead, it's attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH2Ph. So the 1.4 ppm peak isn't explained by option C.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a different structure, but I can't figure it out. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to the reaction part.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides to alkanes via the elimination of HX. Wait, no, another reaction: when alkyl halides react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction to form alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Wurtz reaction, which involves the coupling of two alkyl halides.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction is the elimination of HI from a dihalide to form an alkene.

Wait, but X is likely an alkyl iodide, considering the reaction conditions. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with an iodide substituent, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aryl iodide, but that's not fitting the options.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes an iodide, such as a bromo or chloro group, and the reaction replaces it with a hydroxyl group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkane from an alkyl iodide via the replacement of iodide with a hydrogen.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides to form alkanes. For example, in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can induce the substitution of an alkyl halide to form an alkane and phosphine oxide.

So, if X has an alkyl iodide substituent, the reaction would replace it with a hydrogen, forming an alkane.

So, for example, if X is 4-iodo-benzene, the reaction would form 4-tolylmethane, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if X is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes an iodide, such as a benzyl iodide, the reaction would form a benzyl group with a hydrogen.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a substituent that is an alkyl iodide, like 4-iodo-butylbenzene, and the reaction would replace the iodide with a hydrogen, forming 4-butylbenzene.

But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is para-xylene with an isobutyl group. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a similar structure.

Wait, but in the reaction, if X has an alkyl iodide, then replacing the iodide would form an alkane. So for example, if X is 4-iodo-butylbenzene, the product would be 4-butylbenzene. But that's not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzoyl chloride, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would form benzoyl iodide, but that doesn't fit the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. Another possibility is that the reaction is the elimination of HI from an alkyl halide to form an alkene. For example, if X is a vicinal diiodide, the reaction would eliminate to form an alkene.

But none of the options suggest an alkene product.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkyl bromide or chloride, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is the Wurtz reaction, which would couple two alkyl halides to form an alkane and eliminate halide.

But without knowing X's structure, it's hard to say.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, despite the substituent's NMR not matching perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substituent analysis.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the substituent in X is a secondary butyl group (sec-butyl), and the NMR's 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is due to the methyl group in the substituent. Let me re-examine.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So the substituent's structure is:

Ph—COOH (position 1)
Ph—CH2—CH(CH2CH3) (position 4)

The substituent has:

- CH2 (2H) attached to the ring: 1.7 ppm (m).

- CH (1H) in the middle: 2.9 ppm (m).

- CH2CH3 (3H): 0.9 ppm (t).

But where does the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) come from? Oh, wait, perhaps the 1.4 ppm is the methyl group from the benzoic acid's COOH. No, that's not possible because COOH doesn't have a CH3.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 1.4 ppm is an impurity or from another part of the molecule. But I can't think of any.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should proceed with option C as the answer, despite the substituent's NMR not completely matching.


The problem involves identifying Compound X, which reacts with red phosphorus and HI, based on its IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely an O-H stretch), 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl group), and 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretching). The NMR data includes a 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) peak, which could correspond to a carboxylic acid proton, and aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring. Additional peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) indicate an alkyl chain with branching.

### Analysis of IR and NMR Data:
1. **IR Spectrum**:
   - The broad peak at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.

2. **NMR Spectrum**:
   - The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) peak is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
   - The aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring, with two sets of equivalent protons in the ortho and meta positions relative to the substituents.
   - The peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) indicate an alkyl chain with a branching point (likely a CH group) and terminal methyl groups.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides or the substitution of alkyl halides with hydrogen. However, in this case, the reaction likely involves the substitution of a functional group in Compound X to form the final product.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the branching pattern observed in the alkyl chain.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure does not contain a carboxylic acid group, which is supported by the IR and NMR data.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)) at the para position.  
   - The aromatic protons match the NMR data, with two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm.  
   - The sec-butyl group explains the peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).  
   - The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) peak, however, does not fully align with the substituent in this structure, as the sec-butyl group does not include a CH3 attached to a CH. Despite this discrepancy, this option is the most consistent with the overall data.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Based on the IR and NMR data, the most plausible structure for Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. While the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) peak does not perfectly match the substituent, this option aligns best with the overall spectral data and reaction conditions.

Answer: C
