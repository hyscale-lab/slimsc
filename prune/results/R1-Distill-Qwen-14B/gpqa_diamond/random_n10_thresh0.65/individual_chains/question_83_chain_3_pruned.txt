Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the volume doubles. That should dilute the concentration. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should find the initial concentration after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. So, 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, 0.05 M diluted by doubling the volume gives 0.025 M. Right.

Next, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ions.

But wait, the question asks for two pH values: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part step by step.

First, the equivalence point. To find that, I need to know how much NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be equal to the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.025 M × 0.04 L? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me recheck that. Oh no, wait, wait. Wait, the original solution is 20 cm³ × 0.0
