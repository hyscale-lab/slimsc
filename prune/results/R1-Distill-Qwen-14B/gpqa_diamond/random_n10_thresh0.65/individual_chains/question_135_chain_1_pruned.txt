Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it again. It's about the decay of a boson X, and I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decay channels at the lowest order. The question gives a Lagrangian and the mass of the boson X as 6 GeV. 

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not entirely sure I remember what this Lagrangian represents. Oh, right, this looks like the interaction term between the boson field X and fermion fields. The term λf would be the coupling constant, and ψ_f are the fermion fields. So X is interacting with fermions, and the interaction is proportional to (υ + X), where υ is probably the vacuum expectation value or something similar. But maybe that's not too important for figuring out the decay modes.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find which fermion pairs X can decay into. At lowest order, the decays would be via tree-level Feynman diagrams, which would involve X boson coupling to two fermions. So each decay channel is X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

Now, what's the condition for a decay to be kinematically allowed? The basic rule is that the mass of X must be greater than twice the mass of the fermion it's decaying into. Because each fermion would get half the mass. So, for each fermion pair (like b b-bar), I need to check if 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

Wait, what are the masses of the different fermions? Let me think. The up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV. The strange quark is heavier, maybe around 100 MeV. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, top is way heavier, about 173 GeV. For leptons, electron is negligible, muon is about 0.1 GeV, tau is around 1.77 GeV.

So let's list each possible fermion and their masses:

- e−: ~0.0005 GeV
- μ−: ~0.105 GeV
- τ−: ~1.777 GeV
- u: ~2.2 MeV (so ~0.0022 GeV)
- d: ~4.7 MeV (~0.0047 GeV)
- s: ~95 MeV (~0.095 GeV)
- c: ~1.27 GeV
- b: ~4.1 to 4.7 GeV (let's say ~4.5 for approximation)
- t: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Also, neutrinos are even lighter, so their masses are negligible.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's see which fermions can be produced.

For each fermion f, 2m_f must be ≤ 6 GeV.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: X → b b-bar
