Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT framework. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? It's a framework where you write down all possible interactions that can occur at low energies, beyond the Standard Model but without introducing new particles. So the operators are constructed with higher dimension terms, respecting certain symmetries.

The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Lorentz symmetry includes rotations and boosts, right? And Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations. So Poincare is a bigger symmetry group. But in the context of the effective theory, does SMEFT require operators to be invariant under Poincare?

I think that SMEFT is based on the Standard Model gauge group plus Lorentz symmetry. Because all the SM interactions are Lorentz invariant, and the effective operators are constructed as such. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected, that's for sure.

But what about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes not just Lorentz transformations but also translations. In quantum field theory, translation symmetry is tied to momentum conservation. But in effective theories, especially when considering higher-dimensional operators, do they necessarily respect translations? Or is that automatically part of the setup?

Wait, the operators in SMEFT are built from the Standard Model fields, which are already translationally invariant
