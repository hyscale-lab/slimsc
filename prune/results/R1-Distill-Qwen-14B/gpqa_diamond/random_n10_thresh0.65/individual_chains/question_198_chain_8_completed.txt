Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because usually the stability constants increase with the number of ligands attached, but here β4 is lower than β3. Hmm, maybe it's a typo, or perhaps the complexes are different in some way. Not sure, but I'll proceed.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. So, first, I need to figure out which complex corresponds to dithiocyanato. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^{n+}, and since βn is given, I need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in the solution.

Wait, let me clarify the complexes. The complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^{2−n} for n=1,2,3,4. So the possible species are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{-}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Stability constants (β) are given for each. The β for a complex [Co(SCN)_n] is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from Co^2+ and n SCN^- ions.

So, the general formation equation is:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, with β_n = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

Our goal is to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} in the solution.

The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. That would be the sum of all the cobalt species: free Co^2+ plus each of the complexes.

Since the solution has excess SCN- (0.1 M is much higher than the total Co concentration), we can probably assume that the concentration of free SCN- is approximately 0.1 M because most of it won't be bound to Co. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider it as a variable, but perhaps at 0.1 M, it's in excess, so we can approximate [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M.

So, to find the fraction of each complex, I can use the stability constants and the concentrations.

I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the total Co. The fractions will depend on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligands.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n ) / ( sum over m (β_m * [SCN^-]^m ) )

Wait, but the denominator is sum from m=0 to m=4 of (β_m [SCN^-]^m ), except that when m=0, it's just β_0 which is 1, since the complex is Co^2+ itself. Because for m=0, the complex is just Co^2+ without any ligands. So, β_0 is 1 by definition.

Wait, wait. The stability constant for m=0 would be Co^2+ itself, so β_0 = 1. Because for m=0, the reaction is Co^2+ ⇌ Co^2+ + 0 SCN^-; so the formation constant is [Co^2+]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^0 ) ) = 1/( [Co^2+] ) * [Co^2+] ) = 1. So yes, β_0 is 1.

So, the fraction for each complex is f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / ( sum_{m=0}^4 β_m [SCN^-]^m )

But wait, the β given in the question are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that doesn't make sense because β3 is higher than β2, but β4 is lower than β3. So perhaps the numbering is something else. Wait, perhaps the complexes are not in order of n=1 to 4. Maybe β1 is for n=1, β2 is for n=2, etc. But then why is β4=16, which is lower than β3=63? That would suggest that the stability constant decreases for higher n, which is unusual. Because typically, the more ligands, the more stable the complex, so higher β. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the β values are given in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the problem gives β for each step. Like, the first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+, β1=9. The second step is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2=40. The third step is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_3]^- , β3=63. The fourth step is [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, β4=16.

Wait, but then the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_4]^2- would be the product of all the step constants: β_total = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4. But that's not the same as the β given for each individual complex. Hmm, I might be getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN ligands. So, for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, the βn is the overall formation constant.

In that case, the fractions would be calculated as:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 βm [SCN^-]^m )

Because each term in the denominator is the product of βm and [SCN^-]^m, where m is the number of SCN ligands.

In this problem, n can be 0,1,2,3,4.

So, the denominator is sum from m=0 to m=4 of (βm * [SCN^-]^m )

Given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and β0=1, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but β4 is 16, which is less than β2 (40) and β3 (63). That seems odd because you would expect higher β for higher n. But perhaps the problem is correct, and the β4 is lower than β3.

So proceeding with the given data.

So, let me compute each term in the denominator:

Denominator terms:

m=0: β0 * (0.1)^0 = 1 *1 =1

m=1: 9 * (0.1)^1 = 9 *0.1=0.9

m=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

m=3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

m=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Adding all these up: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator sum is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for m=2 (the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0) is f_2 = (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / 2.3646.

Compute numerator for m=2: 40 *0.01=0.4.

So f_2=0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 (approx 0.169, which is 16.9%).

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which would correspond to this. But wait, wait a minute. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Hmm, but sometimes the color is associated with a specific complex. For example, perhaps the dithiocyanate complex is not the most stable one. Wait, let me think.

Wait, but according to the calculations, [Co(SCN)_2] has a fraction of about 16.9%, which is option D. But why is the answer not higher? Because β3 is 63, which is much higher than β2. So the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex would have a higher fraction. Let me check the fractions for each m:

Compute all fractions:

m=0: 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423 → 42.3%

m=1: 0.9 /2.3646 ≈ 0.381 → 38.1%

m=2:0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169 →16.9%

m=3:0.063 /2.3646 ≈ 0.0266 →2.66%

m=4:0.0016 /2.3646 ≈0.000677 →0.0677%

Wait, that adds up to 42.3 +38.1=80.4, plus 16.9=97.3, plus 2.66=99.96, plus 0.0677=100.027%, which is close enough considering rounding.

So the fraction for m=2 is 16.9% (option D). But wait, why is m=3 (β3=63) having a lower fraction than m=2? Because even though β3 is higher, [SCN^-]^3 is (0.1)^3=0.001, which is much smaller than [SCN^-]^2=0.01. So the product βm * [SCN^-]^m for m=3 is 63 *0.001= 0.063, which is less than m=2's 40*0.01=0.4.

So, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I thought that the dithiocyanato complex is the one with two SCN ligands, which is m=2. So the answer should be 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is the fraction for m=1. So that's the [CoSCN]^+ complex. So why would the answer be D, but the options include C as another possibility.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the denominator. Let me recheck.

Denominator:

m=0:1*(0.1)^0=1

m=1:9*(0.1)=0.9

m=2:40*(0.01)=0.4

m=3:63*0.001=0.063

m=4:16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum them: 1 +0.9 =1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

Yes that's correct.

So for m=2, 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Maybe the blue color is associated with a different complex. I might have that wrong. Wait, I thought that the dithiocyanate is blue, but perhaps it's a different complex. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to a different complex as the dithiocyanato.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the one with four ligands, or maybe three. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking about the dithiocyanate which is [Co(SCN)_2]^+, which would be m=1. But no, because [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is neutral, with two SCN- ligands. Or perhaps I'm getting the charge wrong.

Wait, let me think about the charges. Each SCN- is -1. So for Co^2+:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → 2+ + (-1) = +1

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → 2+ +3*(-1)= -1.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → 2+ +4*(-1)= -2.

So, the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral.

If the problem refers to the blue color as being associated with the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, then our calculation of 16.9% stands as option D.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is the fraction for m=1 ([CoSCN]^+). Could the blue color be for m=1? Or perhaps the problem is considering the first complex as dithiocyanato, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the definition of the dithiocyanate complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to a different complex as the 'dithiocyanato' one. For example, sometimes the dithiocyanate complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2−, but that would require n=4. Wait, no, that can't be. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the term 'dithiocyanato' to mean two SCN ligands, which would be n=2, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the fraction is 16.9%, option D.

But wait, the options given are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So, the correct answer would be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants (β) provided and the concentration of SCN⁻ ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

Here, β₀ = 1 (for free Co²⁺), β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. The denominator is the sum of all terms βₙ \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n for n = 0 to 4.

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{For } n=0: & \quad \beta_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \\
\text{For } n=1: & \quad \beta_1 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \\
\text{For } n=2: & \quad \beta_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \\
\text{For } n=3: & \quad \beta_3 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \\
\text{For } n=4: & \quad \beta_4 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Summing these terms gives:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2)
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex is:
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Step 4: Verify consistency
The fractions for all species sum to approximately 100%, confirming the calculations are correct. The blue dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) corresponds to n=2, and its fraction is 16.9%.

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
