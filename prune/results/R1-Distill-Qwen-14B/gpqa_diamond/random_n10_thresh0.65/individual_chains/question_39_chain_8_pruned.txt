Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, wave functions and probabilities. Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding a particle in a particular region.

The question says that each particle's wave function is given by (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second—that's an odd expression. Because wave functions usually are complex, but I remember that the square modulus is what matters. So the wave function itself is a complex number, but the probability is about the absolute square of it.

But wait, the way the wave function is written here is a little confusing. Let me parse it again. It's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So that would be a complex function where the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wave function ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5)i. So ψ(x) = A + Bi, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is -0.5.

Now, to find the probability of a particle being in a certain region, we take the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. The question states that when they measured the position, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3. That means the probability of finding the particle in x < 1 or x >3 is zero. So the wave function must be zero outside of x=1 to x=3, but we also have to ensure that the total probability (integral from -infty to infty) is 1.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function given is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the square modulus is |ψ|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you square a complex number (a + ib), the modulus is a² + b².

So |ψ(x)|² = [a^2 / (1 + x)] + 0.25.

But wait, the problem says that when you measure the position, you find the particles only between x=1 and x=3. So outside this region, the probability should be zero. But our |ψ(x)|² is a sum of two terms. The only way for the probability to be zero outside 1<x<3 is if |ψ(x)|² is zero outside that interval.

But wait, looking at |ψ(x)|²,
