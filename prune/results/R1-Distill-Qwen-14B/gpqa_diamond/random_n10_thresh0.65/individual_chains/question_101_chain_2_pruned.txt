Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the correct reagent (A) and catalyst (B) from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions often involve things like alkylation or acylation. Wait, but I also recall that when amines react under acidic conditions, they can undergo various reactions like alkylation, especially using carbonyl compounds.

Let me think about the product structure. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Breaking that down, the substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Cyclohexylidene suggests a cyclohexyl group attached via a double bond, right? So it's like a cyclohexane ring with a double bond to a methyl group. Wait, no, cyclohexylidene would be a substituent where the cyclohexane is connected via a double bond. So the substituent is CH₂-Cyclohexylidene? Or maybe it's a cyclohexene ring attached to a methyl group. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclohexenyl group attached to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl) would be a cyclohexyl group (like a six-membered ring) where the connecting point is through a double bond. So maybe the structure is a CH₂ group attached to the pyrrolidine and that CH₂ is connected to a cyclohexene ring via a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexenyl substituent, like a cyclohexene ring attached to the nitrogen via a methylene group.

Wait, I think the product is an enamine. Enamines are formed from the reaction of a ketone or aldehyde with an amine. The process involves two steps: first, the amine attacking the carbonyl to form a hemiaminal, then losing water to form an imine (Schiff base), but if another equivalent of amine is present, it can form an enamine upon protonation and cyclization.

Wait, but wait. Enamine formation typically uses a ketone or aldehyde and
