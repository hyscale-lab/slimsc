Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, the metric given is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²))(dx² + dy²). The question is about finding the area when the radius r is 2. Wait, but in the metric, I don't immediately see an r parameter. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the term pseudosphere makes me think of hyperbolic geometry or maybe some kind of surface with negative curvature. I remember that in 2D, a pseudosphere can have an infinite area because it's like an infinitely extending surface. But wait, the options don't exactly match that. Let me think.

So the metric is in terms of x and y coordinates. Let me try to analyze the form. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That looks like a sphere's equation if x² + y² is less than 4. Oh wait, but 4 is 2 squared, so radius 2. Hmm, so the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which suggests that the metric is defined when x² + y² < 4, because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative.

Wait, but the metric has 32/(4 - x² - y²) multiplying dx² and dy². So as x² + y² approaches 4, the coefficient blows up. So maybe this is a model of hyperbolic space or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius 2. I think a pseudosphere's area might be infinite, but I'm not certain
