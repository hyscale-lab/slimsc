Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break this down.

First, I should probably draw out the structures to visualize what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group and also a carbaldehyde group.

Wait, let me think about the functional groups. The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne attached to a cyclohexane.

I remember that alkynes can undergo various reactions. Maybe I need to do some cyclopropanation or use them in a way to form rings. Alternatively, perhaps some kind of addition or oxidation. Let's think about how to get from an alkyne to the aldehyde.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane? Or is it cyclohexane with a triple bond? Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so I think it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. Like, cyclohexyl-ethynyl.

But wait, ethynylcyclohexane would have the structure cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a triple bond? No, wait, ethynyl is the substituent, so it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH?

Wait, no, wait. Ethynylcyclohexane is probably cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is -C≡CH. So, cyclohexane with a substituent that's a triple bond. So, like, cyclohexane attached to a -C≡CH group.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, and we need to get to 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Looking at the target, the substituent on the cyclohexane is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait,
