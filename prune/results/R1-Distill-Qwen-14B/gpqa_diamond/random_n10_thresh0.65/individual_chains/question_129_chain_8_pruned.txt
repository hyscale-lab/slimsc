Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are multiple steps, and each step involves a different reaction. Plus, there are some hints given, so I'll need to pay attention to those.

Let me start by listing out the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H₂ in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO₂ to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm⁻¹, while the IR of E is around 1715 cm⁻¹.

The options for E are A, B, C, D, each with different substituted ketones.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each reaction step and what it implies.

Starting with compound A reacting with HCN to form B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So, I'm thinking that compound A is a ketone or aldehyde because HCN addition (like in the cyanohydrin formation) typically occurs at carbonyl groups. The IR peak of A at 1750 cm⁻¹ supports this because that's a typical region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, A is probably a ketone.

So, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which is compound B. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached? Wait, no, the cyanohydrin is a vicinal diol with a nitrile group?

Wait, no. Actually, in the cyanohydrin formation, the ketone (R2CO) reacts with HCN to form R2C(OH)CN. So, B would have an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So if A is a cyclic ketone, then B would be a cyclo structure with an -OH and -CN group adjacent.

Then, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst, maybe for hydrogenation. So what's the functional groups in B? It has an -OH (alcohol) and a nitrile (CN). Wait, but H2 and Pd usually reduce nitriles to amines. Do they? Wait, I think hydrogenation of nitriles with H2 and Pd (like in catalytic hydrogenation) typically reduces the nitrile to an amine. So the CN group becomes CH₂NH₂? Or maybe CH₂NH₂ if it's fully reduced, but wait, I might be mixing up. Alternatively, maybe in some conditions, a nitrile is reduced to an amine. Let me think. No, wait, nitriles (RCN) upon hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst (like Raney Ni) typically reduce to RCH2NH2. But with Pd, perhaps not. Oh wait, maybe under different conditions, it reduces to an amine, but sometimes it might stop at the imine stage. Hmm, but with H2 and Pd, I think it goes all the way to the amine.

Wait, but compound B is the cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group on the adjacent carbon. So structure-wise, if A is a cyclic ketone, say cyclopentanone, then B would be 3-hydroxy-3-cyanocyclopentane. Then, when B is hydrogenated, what happens? The nitrile group would become an amine. But wait, in hydrogenation, the nitrile group (RCN) would become RCH2NH2. So in this case, the adjacent carbon would have a CH2NH2 group. But wait, compound
