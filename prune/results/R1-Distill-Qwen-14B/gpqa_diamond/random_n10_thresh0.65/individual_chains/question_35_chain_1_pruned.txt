Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row (0 -i) and the second row (i 0). So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. But before that, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues of S first, then scale them by c.

Let me write down matrix S. It's:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Hmm, this looks familiar. Oh right, this is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is [0 -i; i 0], which matches what S is here. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±ħ/2 for each component. Wait, but let's be precise. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by ħ/2, they become the eigenvalues for the spin angular momentum.

Wait, in this case, the operator S is the Pauli Y matrix. So the eigenvalues of S
