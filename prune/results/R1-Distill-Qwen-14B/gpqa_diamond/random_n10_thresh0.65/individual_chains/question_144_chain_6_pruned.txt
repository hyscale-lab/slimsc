Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and decay distances. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D with various values in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is distance = velocity * lifetime. So I need to find both of these.

First, I should probably find the lifetime of the meson. I recall that the lifetime (τ) is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check that. Oh right, the relation is τ = ħ / Γ, because Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime in natural units.

Wait, but units can get tricky here. I think I need to convert everything into consistent units. Let me jot down the constants I'll need. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, no, wait, ħ is usually in J·s, but since we're working with GeV, I need to make sure all units are compatible.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula for the mean decay length is (c * τ) multiplied by the velocity. But first, I need the velocity of the meson. Since it's moving at a relativistic speed, I should calculate its gamma factor and then find the velocity βc.

So, let's think: The production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E = γ m c^2. So I can find γ by E/(m c^2). Wait, but m c^2 is given as 1.2 GeV, so γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV. Let me calculate that: 8 / 1.2 is the same as 80/12 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is approximately 6.6667.
