Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on adamantane structures, but I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with a very rigid structure, kind of like a cage-like molecule.

The first reaction is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I think KOH is a strong base, maybe acting as a dehydrohalogenation agent. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (1 and 3), perhaps an elimination reaction occurs. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Adamantane has a structure where the carbons are arranged in a diamond-like lattice, so the positions 1 and 3 are actually on adjacent faces. Wait, but in a dibromide, would the positions be such that elimination can happen? Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene.

Wait, when two vicinal bromides (like adjacent carbons each with Br) undergo elimination with a strong base, they form an alkene. But wait, in this case, 1 and 3 are not adjacent carbons. Hmm, wait, adamantane's structure—each carbon is connected to three others. So 1 and 3 positions are on different faces but connected through the structure. Wait, perhaps the two Br are on opposite sides, or maybe the same face?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. I remember that when dibromides are treated with strong bases like KOH, especially in elimination, they form alkenes. But in this case, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Oh wait, the product's IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. So maybe the product is a ketone.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane: when heated with KOH, perhaps the two Br groups are on adjacent carbons, leading to elimination of two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. But if that's the case, would that give an alkene? Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely that the KOH is causing the bromides to leave, but since there are two Br atoms, maybe it's a double elimination, forming a double bond. But then the IR doesn't show a peak for an alkene (which would be around 1650 cm^-1, maybe), but a carbonyl at 1720, which is more like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but wait. If the product after KOH treatment is a ketone, that suggests some kind of oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an elimination product that's a ketone. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the product is a cyclohexane derivative with a ketone group.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is such that elimination leads to forming a bridgehead double bond, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, replacing Br with something else. Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the
