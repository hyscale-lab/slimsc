Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these titration calculations. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D with different pairs of pH values.

First, I think I need to figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, you can use the dilution formula: C1V1 = C2V2. So the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

Calculating the diluted concentration: C2 = (C1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers, C2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / (40 cm³) = (1) / (40) = 0.0125 M. Wait, no, wait, 0.05 * 20 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M? Wait, wait, let me recalculate. Oh wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, after adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) water, total volume is 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh okay, right. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they react in a 1:1 ratio.

So the moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So the moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question isn't about the equivalence point directly; it's about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence
