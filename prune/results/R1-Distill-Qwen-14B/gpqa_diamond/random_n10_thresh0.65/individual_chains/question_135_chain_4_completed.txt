Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I think this is describing the interaction between the boson X and some fermions. So X is a boson, and it's interacting with fermions ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the rest mass of the boson is at least the sum of the rest masses of the products. So, m_X ≥ 2m_f. If the fermion is too heavy, this won't be possible.

So, looking at the possible decay options, each one lists different fermion pairs. Let's list out the fermions and their masses approximately, so I can check which are allowed.

Fermion masses (in GeV/c²) approximately:
- e⁻ (electron): ~0.000511 GeV
- μ⁻ (muon): ~0.105 GeV
- τ⁻ (tau): ~1.777 GeV
- u: ~0.003 GeV (current quark mass, but in reality, the u and d are much lighter)
- d: ~0.005 GeV
- s: ~0.095 GeV
- c: ~1.27 GeV
- b: ~4.7 GeV
- t: ~173 GeV (way too heavy, but X is 6 GeV, so can't decay into top)
- Also, neutrinos are even lighter, but the problem doesn't list any νν pairs, so maybe they're not considered here.

Wait, the problem's options include pairs like b\bar{b}, which would require m_X ≥ 2m_b. Let me calculate 2m_b. m_b is about 4.7 GeV, so 2*4.7 is ~9.4 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9.4 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because that would require more mass than it has.

Similarly, for the tau, m_tau is about 1.777 GeV. 2*m_tau is ~3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

For the charm quark, m_c is ~1.27 GeV. 2*m_c is ~2.54 GeV, which is allowed. So c c-bar decay is possible.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: X → b\bar{b}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.
Wait, tau decay is allowed, but b is not. So option A includes b b-bar which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
Looking at this, the fermions considered are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Let's check their masses.

c: 1.27 GeV. 2*1.27=2.54 <6. So okay.
s: m_s is about 0.095 GeV. 2*0.095=0.19 <6. So okay.
u: 0.003, 2*0.003=0.006 <6.
d: 0.005, 2*0.005=0.01 <6.
tau: as before, 2*1.777≈3.55 <6.
mu: 0.105, 2*0.105=0.21 <6.
e: 0.0005, 2*0.0005=0.001 <6.

So all these fermions are allowed. What about t? No, because t is 173 GeV, which would need 346 GeV for X to decay into t t-bar. X is only 6, so no.

Wait, but option B includes c c-bar. So why is that allowed? Oh, because 2m_c is less than 6 GeV. So is the decay X→c c-bar allowed? Yes, because 2.54 <6. So B seems possible.

Option C: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
Wait, t t-bar. 2mt is ~346 GeV, way higher than 6. So decay into t t-bar is not allowed. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
Again, b b-bar is 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So D is incorrect.

So, looking back, the only options that do not include b b-bar are B and C. But C includes t t-bar which is impossible. So the correct answer must be B.

Wait, let me double-check. The mass of X is 6 GeV. For each fermion pair:

- b quark: 4.7 GeV each → 2*4.7=9.4 >6 → no.
- c: 1.27*2=2.54 <6 → yes.
- s: 0.095*2=0.19 <6 → yes.
- u: 0.003*2=0.006 <6 → yes.
- d: 0.005*2=0.01 <6 → yes.
- tau: 1.777*2≈3.55 <6 → yes.
- mu: 0.105*2=0.21 <6 → yes.
- e: 0.0005*2=0.001 <6 → yes.

So all these fermion pairs are allowed except those with b and t, which are too heavy.

Looking at the options, option B includes all the possible fermion pairs except b and t. So option B is the correct one.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we use the condition that the boson's mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it decays into: \( m_X \geq 2m_f \). The fermion masses (in GeV/c²) are approximately:

- \( m_e \approx 0.000511 \), \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \), \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \),  
- \( m_u \approx 0.003 \), \( m_d \approx 0.005 \), \( m_s \approx 0.095 \),  
- \( m_c \approx 1.27 \), \( m_b \approx 4.7 \), \( m_t \approx 173 \).

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which requires \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} < 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \), \( b\bar{b} \) is not allowed. Thus, **A is incorrect**.

2. **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+\,e^- \).  
   - \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
   - \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
   - \( 2m_u \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
   - \( 2m_d \approx 0.01 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
   - \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.55 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
   - \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
   - \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
   All fermion pairs in this option are kinematically allowed. Thus, **B is correct**.

3. **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which requires \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} < 346 \, \text{GeV} \), \( t\bar{t} \) is not allowed. Thus, **C is incorrect**.

4. **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which requires \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} < 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \), \( b\bar{b} \) is not allowed. Thus, **D is incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The only option that lists all kinematically allowed fermion pairs is **B**.
