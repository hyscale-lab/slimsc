Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I'll think it through.

First, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can figure out the right steps to calculate each.

Let me start by understanding the initial solution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? When we dilute it, the concentration decreases. So the initial concentration after dilution will be half, since we're adding equal volumes. Oh wait, because 20 cm³ of acetic acid is diluted with 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the initial concentration is 0.05 M divided by 2, so 0.025 M. Yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, wait. Wait, no, actually, the formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = (1)/40 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to acetate ions.

But wait, for the 25% titration point, that's when 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So I need to figure out how much
