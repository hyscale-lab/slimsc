Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me think this through step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. Typically, the cyanide ion acts as the nucleophile and adds to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, under what conditions does that happen?

Oh right, the formation of cyanohydrins. The reaction of ketones with NaCN usually requires an acid catalyst. Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So the CN- can attack the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen gets a negative charge, which is then protonated. So for the first step, reagent A must be an acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ as A, while C and D have NaHSO3. So what's the difference?

Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- but under acidic conditions? Or is it more for other reactions like maybe elimination or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The cyanohydrin formation uses an acid like H2SO4 or H3O+ to protonate the carbonyl. So reagent A in the first reaction should be H3O+ because that's a strong acid that can facilitate the nucleophilic addition. So looking at the options, A and B have H3O+ as A. So the first part of the answer is either A or B.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with B (and water) to produce the corresponding butanoic acid. So what's happening here? The nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I recall that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under various conditions. To get a carboxylic acid, you typically use strong acidic conditions. Like using HCl with heat. So the reagent B is probably an acid, like HCl or something else. But what's the role of water in this? Oh, right, because hydrolysis reactions usually involve water.

Wait, but wait. So the starting material is a 2-hydroxy nitrile. Hmm, so it's a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. When you hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you need to make sure the conditions are right. Let me think about the possible reaction steps. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed in acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. Alternatively, in basic conditions, they form carboxylates which can be acidified.

But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so probably the conditions are acidic. So reagent B is likely HCl, which would provide the acidic environment. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option C has B as HCl. So which option is it?

Wait, let me look back. The options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So from the first reaction, A must be H3O+ (so A or B). From the second reaction, B must be HCl (so A or C). So the only option that fits both is option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me think again about the first reaction. Could NaHSO3 be a possibility? NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and sulfite ions. But in the formation of cyanohydrin, the acid is typically H3O+ or H2SO4. I don't think sulfite would be used as a catalyst here. So option A is looking more correct.

So putting it together, reagent A is H3O+ (from options A or B), and reagent B is HCl (from options A or C). So the correct option is A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the cyanide ion to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a suitable acid catalyst, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions for this reaction. Thus, reagent A must be H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This typically requires strong acidic conditions. HCl is a common acid used for such hydrolysis reactions, making it the appropriate choice for reagent B.

From the options, only option A satisfies both conditions: A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
