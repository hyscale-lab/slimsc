Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca^2+ into a complex. The complex formation is important here. The key thing is the formation constant, which indicates how strong the complex is. A high K value means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. The solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think I need to use the formation constant formula to find out how much of the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA.

The formation constant (K) for a complex is given by the equation K = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formation of the complex is:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this case, the complex is already formed. So the solution contains CaEDTA^2- at a concentration of 0.02 M.

But wait, in solution, some of this complex might dissociate. So, the free calcium ions and EDTA ions would come from the dissociation. But EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so it's usually present in solution as a series of deprotonated forms. But since the pH is ideal, maybe the EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y^4-). 

So, assuming that the pH is such that EDTA exists as Y^4-, and the solution is at a condition where all the EDTA is Y^4-. So, the dissociation of the complex would be:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

The dissociation constant, Kd, is the inverse of the formation constant. So Kd = 1/Kf. Because Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]), so Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So, Kd = 2e-11.

But wait, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let the change be x. So, at equilibrium, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 - x, but since Kd is very small (2e-11 is tiny), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Thus, the expression becomes Kd ≈ x^2 / 0.02.

So, x^2 = Kd * 0.02 = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Taking square roots: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = wait, sqrt of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, but in this case, x is the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates from the complex. So the concentration of Ca^2+ in solution would be 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2-.

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is way smaller), [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x. So Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x²/0.02 = 2e-11.

So x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13. So x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2? Let me compute sqrt(4e-13):

sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 (since 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2). So yes, x=2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7, matching option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of the formation constant \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \( x \). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \quad (\text{since } x \ll 0.02),
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x.
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
