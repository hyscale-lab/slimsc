Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're told that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can probably use some standard equations from that context.

Wait, right. In LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So, maybe n1_upper / n1_lower = 2, and for star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = something else. Oh wait, the problem states that star_1's atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2? Or maybe the other way around. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, no. Let me read it again. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think that means for the same energy level, the population (excitation) in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps the ratio of the populations is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2.

But wait, the Boltzmann factor is about the ratio of populations in two different energy levels. So if we're talking about the same energy level, that might not apply. Wait, no, I think the question is about the same specific energy level being excited differently between the two stars. Or am I getting this wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference between the levels is given, and the excitation refers to the ratio of atoms in that level to the lower level. So let's model it.

Let me denote the excitation as the ratio of the upper state to the lower state. For star_1, this ratio is R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower. For star_2, it's R2
