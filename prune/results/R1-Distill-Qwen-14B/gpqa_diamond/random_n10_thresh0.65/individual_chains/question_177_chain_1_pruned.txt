Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting. But then the question is about their luminosities.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says they have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So same T for both stars.

Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, I think that affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but maybe it's already accounted for when they determined the wavelengths. Or perhaps the question is assuming that the rest wavelengths are the same, so the Doppler effect doesn't affect the temperature calculation. Or maybe it's a redshift or blueshift consideration.

Wait, but when calculating the luminosity using black body radiation, the formula depends on the star's actual temperature, radius, and distance. But wait, the problem states that we can assume they radiate as black bodies. So let me think about the luminosity formula.

The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Since both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. So when calculating the ratio of luminosities, L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) ) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, that term is 1, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is about 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is 2.25.

Wait, but wait. The radial velocities might come into play here. Because the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths could be affected. So perhaps the star with a higher radial velocity (Star_2) is moving away, causing a redshift, which would imply that the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. But earlier, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler effect is already accounted for, meaning their actual temperatures are the same as observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed temperature. Let me think. If Star_2 is moving away at 70
