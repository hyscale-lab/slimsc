Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so we're dealing with stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots affect the photospheric temperature and the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

The problem says that a star has certain parameters: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When no spots are present, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, spots are cooler regions, right? So when spots cover part of the surface, the star's overall brightness decreases, which would lower the effective temperature. But I'm not exactly sure how effective temperature is calculated in this scenario.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So, factor = ratio_no_spots / ratio_with_spots.

In the stellar photosphere, it's assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation applies. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

The transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. So, the energy difference between the two levels is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between level 2 and level 1 using the wavelength.
2. Use the Boltzmann factor to find the ratio n2/n1 at Teff = 6000 K (no spots) and Teff = 5500 K (with spots).
3. Find the ratio of these two ratios to get the factor.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio n2/n1 decreases when Teff is lower. Because the Boltzmann factor is exponential of (-ΔE/(kT)), so as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n2/n1 (since higher energy level is n2) would decrease. That makes sense because lower temperatures make it harder to populate higher energy levels.

So, the factor is (n2/n1)_6000K divided by (n2/n1)_5500K.

Let me compute this.

First, compute ΔE. Let's see, wavelength λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

Energy per photon E = hc/λ. h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s.

Calculating E:
E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10)
= (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7)
