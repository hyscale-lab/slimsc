Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. I should note that, but maybe wait until I look at the NMR data and the reactions to see if that helps. The NMR data is given, which should help in determining the structure.

The reagents used are three steps:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat.

I remember that NaNO2 and HCl are typically involved in diazotization reactions, especially with aromatic amines. Diazonium salts are formed, and then they can undergo various reactions depending on the conditions. The second step is water, which might lead to hydrolysis or some kind of substitution. The third step is aqueous KOH and heat, which makes me think of elimination reactions, maybe forming an alkyne or an alkene through dehydrohalogenation or something similar.

Let me first analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure before considering the reactions.

The 1H-NMR data is:

9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Breakdown:

9.72 ppm: A triplet integrating to 1H. That's a downfield shift, maybe an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe this is an aldehyde group.

6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Could be aromatic protons. The doublet suggests two equivalent protons adjacent to substituents or perhaps in a para-substituted benzene ring. Wait, if it's a para-substituted ring, the protons would couple with each other, but in a coupling pattern that's a doublet for each, but maybe it's part of a meta or para substitution.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. So perhaps another pair of aromatic protons. Maybe two protons adjacent to substituents on a benzene ring. If I have two benzene rings, perhaps each substituted at the para position.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton, but it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's two protons in a conjugated system, like a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen or another functional group. Or maybe it's part of an aromatic ring with substituents causing the coupling to be broad.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, integrating to 2H. That's in the range of CH2 groups, possibly next to an electronegative atom. Like OCH2 or NCH2. Wait, the molecular formula includes N, so maybe it's an N-containing group. A CH2 adjacent to N could be like in an amine or amide, but the compound has an aldehyde (from the 9.72 peak), so maybe it's a secondary amine or something else.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree
