Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X, given its mass and the interaction Lagrangian provided.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, right, the interaction is between the boson X and some fermions. The Lagrangian looks like it's coupling X to fermion fields. The structure is similar to how the Higgs field couples to fermions, perhaps. Because in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to fermions proportional to their mass, which comes from Yukawa interactions.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. That's a key point. To figure out the possible decay products, I need to think about the possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into. The energy required for each decay depends on the mass of the fermions involved.

Wait, for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the total energy (which is the mass of the boson) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because E = m for each particle at rest, so the minimum is 2m_f for each fermion. So for X to decay into f f-bar, m_X must be >= 2 m_f.

So I need to find all the fermions whose mass is less than or equal to half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Now, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me list them.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
Each quark has a mass, but remember that the mass here is the current quark mass. However, in many cases, especially in processes where the quarks are created as a pair, the constituent mass might come into play. But wait, the interaction here is given by the Lagrangian, which includes ψ_f, so perhaps it's the current masses. Let me think.

Wait, the current quark masses are roughly:
-
