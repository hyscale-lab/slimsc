Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, and the main ones are the different proton-proton (pp) chains. The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch suddenly stops. Oh right, the pp chain has multiple branches, I think pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch contributes to the production of different neutrinos, especially the high-energy ones.

So, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to pp-I and pp-II. Wait, noâ€”wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The pp-I branch produces lower energy neutrinos because it's the dominant branch and runs at lower temperatures, maybe. Or is it the other way around? Wait, I think the pp-III branch involves higher temperatures and produces higher-energy neutrinos. Because in the core of the Sun, the temperature is higher, so the pp-III branch occurs, which leads to the production of higher-energy particles. So if the pp-III suddenly stops, that would affect the flux of higher-energy neutrinos.

But the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what's the normal situation without the pp-III stopping?

In the Sun, most neutrinos come from the pp-I chain, I think. The pp-I process produces lower-energy neutrinos, like around a few hundred keV. The pp-III branch, which occurs at higher temperatures, produces higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the flux of higher-energy neutrinos would drop, but the lower ones would still come from pp-I and maybe the pp-II branch?

Wait, but the pp-II process is less significant than pp-I and pp-III. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos would be less. So the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would decrease more than in band 1 (700-800 keV), because band 2 neutrinos are higher energy and are mainly produced by pp-III.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So neutrinos from the Sun take about 8 minutes to reach Earth, so any change in the neutrino production would have reached us by now.

So, before the pp-III stopped, both bands would have neutrinos from pp-III. But now, if pp-III stops, then the
