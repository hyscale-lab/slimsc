Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But wait, the RV method gives us the mass, but with a sin(i) factor, right? So maybe the inclination isn't exactly known, but since they are using the RV method, maybe the probabilities are based on that.

The key points given are: same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radius, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh wait, same radius but different masses? So the stars are similar in size but different in mass.

I think the probability of a transit depends on a few factors. The main formula I remember is that the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2, but also depends on the orbital distance. Because the chance of the planet passing in front depends on the alignment—so a smaller orbital distance (closer star) might mean higher chances? Or is it more about the star's size relative to the planet's orbit?

Wait, the formula I recall for the transit probability (for a circular orbit, which both are) is roughly (R_p / a)^2, but wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. No, wait, the probability is more about the geometry. The probability P is approximately (R_* + R_p) / a, but wait that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Ah, right, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just R_p / a. But wait, R_p is the planet's radius, and a is the semi-major axis. But wait, wait, the actual formula is R_* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The probability of transit is (R_* / a) * (something else?), or perhaps (R_p / a) * (R_* / a) or something like that.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing depth and probability. Let me think again. The transit depth is (R_p / R_* )^2. The probability of a transit is higher when the orbital plane is aligned, but how probable is that? Oh, right, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the distance between the star and planet. So P ≈ (R_* )/(a), but that can't be right because if a is the semi-major axis, which is much larger than R_*, it's a small probability.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_*)/(a) multiplied by some factor. Let me recall. The probability is actually the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbital disk. The area ratio is (pi R_*(R_* )) / (pi a^2), so (R_*)^2 / a^2. But wait, that
