Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that half. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The astronomers are observing this star, and when it rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations. But here's the twist: this situation mimics the presence of an exoplanet in terms of the light curve. The question is asking what the radius of the exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do.

Hmm. So I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to the variation that would be caused by an exoplanet. The key here is to find the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) such that the light curve's amplitude is the same.

Wait, but how do spots and an exoplanet affect the light curve differently? Oh right, when a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The amount of light blocked depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. For spots, the brightness changes as the spots rotate into and out of view. The spots are darker, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer, and when they're on the far side, it's brighter. But in this case, since it's a hemisphere, each full rotation would cause a dip in brightness when the spotted area is facing us.

Let me try to model both scenarios.

First, the star's without spots. The exoplanet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits. The depth of the dip is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) is (Rpl^2) / (Rstar^2). So the amplitude is proportional to the square of the ratio of their radii.

Now, for the star with spots. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, so the total area covered by spots is 20% of a hemisphere. The radius of the star is Rstar. The area of a hemisphere is (4π Rstar²)/2 = 2π Rstar². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4π Rstar².

But wait, the effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the total flux from the star when the spots are facing us will be less than when they're not.

Flux from a star is proportional to its surface area multiplied by the temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law). So the total flux without any spots would be F = σTeff^4 * 4π Rstar².

But when the spots are visible, the flux from the spotted area is less. The area of the spots is 0.4π Rstar², and their temperature is Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the flux when spots are visible is F' = [σ (Teff)^4 * (4π Rstar² - 0.4π Rstar²)] + [σ (5000)^4 * 0.4π Rstar² ) ].

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler, their contribution is less. So the total flux when spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The total flux without spots is F0 = σ * Teff^4 * 4π Rstar².

When spots are visible, the flux is F_spot = σ * (Teff^4) * (4π Rstar² - A_spots) + σ * (Teff - 1000)^4 * A_spots, where A_spots is the area of the spots.

But wait, the calculation might get complicated with temperatures. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the flux variation as a simple area effect, assuming that the spots are black and cause a dip in brightness based on their coverage. But the temperature difference complicates things because the spots emit less flux. Hmm, but the problem says that the star's effective temperature is 6000K, but the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spots are at 5000K.

Wait, maybe the approach is to calculate the change in flux caused by the spots. The star's total flux without spots is F0 = 4π Rstar² * σ * (6000)^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F_spot = F0 * (1 - (f * (T_spot^4)/(Teff^4)) ), where f is the filling factor (20% or 0.2). Wait, no, because the spots cover a fraction f of the surface. So the flux from the star would be F0 * (1 - f) + f
