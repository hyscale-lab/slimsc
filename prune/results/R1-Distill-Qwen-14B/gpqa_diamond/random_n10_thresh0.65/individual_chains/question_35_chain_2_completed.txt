Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Let's try to unpack this step by step.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are related to Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli Y matrix is similar to the given S matrix. Let me think: the Pauli Y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches exactly what S is here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y.

So, Ay = c * sigma_y. And c is h/(4π). But wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator for spin-1/2 particles is generally given by ħ times the Pauli matrices divided by 2. Wait, let me think: Oh right, the spin operators are S_i = (ħ/2) sigma_i. So the components are half of the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ.

Wait, but in this problem, Ay is given as c·S, where c is h/(4π). Let me compute c. Planck's constant h is 2π ħ. So c = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

Wait, because sigma_y is the Pauli Y matrix, which is the same as the S matrix given.

So Ay has the form (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix looks like:

(0, (-i)(ħ/2))
(i)(ħ/2, 0)

So when we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me set up the matrix Ay - a I:

[ (-a)       (-i)(ħ/2)       ]
[ (i)(ħ/2)   (-a)         ]

The determinant is [(-a)(-a) - ( (-i)(ħ/2) * (i)(ħ/2) ) ].

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) * (ħ^2)/(4) ) ].

Simplify (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So it's a² - (1 * ħ²/4 ) = 0.

So a² = ħ²/4.

Taking square roots, a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues of sigma matrices are ±1. So when we have any multiple of sigma, the eigenvalues would be the multiple times ±1.

Wait, let me double-check. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1. So for Ay = c sigma_y, with c= ħ/2, the eigenvalues should be c*(±1) = ± ħ/2. Hmm, but earlier calculation gave a²= (ħ/2)^2, so a= ± ħ/2. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part are ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real, I think. Because the Pauli matrices have real eigenvalues. Wait, no, wait: sigma matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so Ay has eigenvalues ± (h/(4pi)) * 1. So, c = h/(4pi), so a = ± c = ± h/(4pi). Wait, earlier I thought c is h/(4pi) and S is sigma_y, so Ay = c sigma_y. So eigenvalues are c*(+1) and c*(-1), so ± c, which is ± h/(4pi). So the eigenvalues should be ± h/(4pi), real numbers.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B suggests eigenvalues with real parts and imaginary parts. That can't be right because the eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real. Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian because their conjugate transpose equals themselves. Sigma_y is Hermitian. So since Ay = c sigma_y, and c is real, then Ay is Hermitian. So its eigenvalues must be real.

So any option suggesting imaginary parts in eigenvalues must be incorrect. So option A and B can be eliminated because they imply complex eigenvalues.

Wait, let me check: option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh. But since the eigenvalues are real, the imaginary parts are zero. So option A is wrong.

Option B has eigenvalues with real and imaginary parts, so that's wrong too.

So now, looking at options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Let me think. The square of the angular momentum operator A² is (since A is spin here) equal to (ħ^2) S(S+1), where S is the spin quantum number. For a spin-1/2 particle, S=1/2, so A² would have eigenvalues (ħ^2)(3/4). So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, would it also be an eigenfunction of A²?

In quantum mechanics, for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenfunctions of one component of angular momentum (like Ay) are not eigenfunctions of another component (like Az), but they are eigenfunctions of A². Because A² commutes with all components of A. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A².

But option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. Which is correct because the components don't commute. So the eigenfunctions are simultaneous eigenfunctions of A² and Ay, but not of Az. So option C is correct in that part. So option C's statement would be correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Basis functions could refer to the eigenvectors forming a basis, which they do. But I'm not sure if that's what the option is saying. Alternatively, perhaps it's suggesting that the eigenvectors are the same as the basis vectors of Ay's matrix, which might not be the case. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the operator Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvectors which form a basis for C^2. So the eigenvectors are a basis, so D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I'm not sure if that's the correct way to phrase it, but perhaps D is correct in stating that.

Wait, but let's think again. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form a basis. So option D could be correct as well. But I'm not certain.

So now, the question is which of the options is correct during the calculation.

Let me recap:

Eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/(4π) because Ay = c sigma_y, c = ħ/(4π), and sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1.

So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/(4π). So these are real numbers, so any option suggesting there's an imaginary part is wrong. So options A and B are out.

Now, looking at C and D.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As discussed, since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az]=iħ A something, so they don't commute. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure. The operator's matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis. So I think D is correct in that the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

So, if the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², then C is correct.

So during the calculation, which statement is correct?

So, the correct eigenvalues are ± ħ/(4 π), which is what I calculated. Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the eigenvalues are ±2πh, but that's not matching. Option B is incorrect because the eigenvalues are real. So the correct eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π). So looking at the options, none of the options directly state that. Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, wait, let me recheck. I thought c is h/(4π). But wait, the problem says c = h/(4π). So Ay = c S. And S is sigma_y. So Ay = (h/(4π)) sigma_y. So the eigenvalues of Ay are (h/(4π)) multiplied by the eigenvalues of sigma_y, which are ±1. So eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real numbers, with no imaginary parts.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's not correct either.

So options A and B are incorrect.

So the correct statements must be either C or D.

Now, option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I thought earlier, this is correct. Because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay aren't eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given. So this is a bit ambiguous. The eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so the statement is correct. But I'm not sure. The question is, which of the statements is correct during the calculation.

Wait, but the question is about which statement you will consider to be correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, during the calculation, when you diagonalize Ay, you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The correct statements are about the properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.

So option C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Hmm. The eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so in that sense, they are the basis functions. So whether D is correct depends on what it means. If the eigenvectors are considered as the basis, then D is correct. I'm a bit conflicted here.

But going back to the options, C is a correct statement, so the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, given as:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

2. **Hermiticity of \( A_y \):**
   - The Pauli \( Y \)-matrix \( S \) is Hermitian, and since \( c \) is real, \( A_y \) is also Hermitian. This ensures that its eigenvalues are real, and any eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are orthogonal.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** States that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Suggests eigenvalues with both real and imaginary parts (\( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) imaginary and \( \pm 1 \) real). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real, as \( A_y \) is Hermitian.
   - **Option C:** Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), but not of \( A_z \) (the \( z \)-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is ambiguous but could be interpreted as correct, as the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D space. However, this option is less precise compared to Option C.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Options A and B are incorrect because they imply complex eigenvalues, which contradicts the Hermitian nature of \( A_y \). Option D is correct but less precise. Option C is the most accurate and directly addresses the properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues during the calculation.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
