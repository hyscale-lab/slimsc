Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry, specifically looking for which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, so I need to think this through.

First, let me remember what C3h symmetry entails. From what I recall, C3h is a point group in molecular symmetry. Point groups are all about the symmetry elements a molecule has. C3h has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). Oh wait, also, the combination of these gives a horizontal inversion, I think. So, it's a combination of rotation and reflection.

So, the molecule must have a threefold axis and a mirror plane that's horizontal. I should look for a structure that has that.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
Option C: Triisopropyl borate
Option D: Quinuclidine

Wait, the question says which of the following molecules has C3h symmetry. So I need to determine which structure allows for C3 rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Let's think about each option.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure is like B with three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are symmetrical, so the molecule has a trigonal planar arrangement around B. So, does it have threefold symmetry? Yes, because if you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, triisopropyl borane has a trigonal planar structure, but when it's borate, it's probably tetrahedral. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Triisopropyl borane is [B(iPr)3], which is trigonal pyramidal, I think. So, it's not flat. If it's trigonal pyramidal, then maybe the point group is C3v. Because it has a C3 axis and three mirror planes. So, perhaps C3v symmetry, not C3h.

Alternatively, if the molecule is planar, like triphenylphosphine oxide or something similar, it would have a different symmetry. But
