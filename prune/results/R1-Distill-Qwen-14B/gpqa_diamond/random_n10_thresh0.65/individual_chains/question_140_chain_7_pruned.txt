Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what each part is saying.

The problem starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X has an element with a heavier isotope—maybe like deuterium or something else. Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, if a molecule has equal protons and neutrons, that's probably H2O? No, wait, water has H and O. Wait, no, let's think. Wait, no—if W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like H2O? Because H is 1 proton, O has 8 protons. But H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Hmm, but the total would have 2(1) + 8 = 10 protons. How about neutrons? O's neutrons are 8 (since O is usually 16, so 8 neutrons). So the molecule would have 2 H (each with 0 neutrons) and O with 8. So total neutrons would be 8. Protons are 2+8=10. Oh, so that wouldn't be equal. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong molecule.

Wait, another possibility: CH4. No, that's 4 H and 1 C. Hmm. Maybe NH3? No, that's 3 H and 1 N. Or
