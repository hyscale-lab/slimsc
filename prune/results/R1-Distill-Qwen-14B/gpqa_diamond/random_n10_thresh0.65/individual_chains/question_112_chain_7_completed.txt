Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm a bit new to this.

Alright, the problem is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, right. When a state is given as proportional, we have to find the normalization constant. So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, but to make it a proper state vector, the inner product should be 1. So I'll compute the inner product of alpha with itself.

The inner product of |alpha> is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 -i)(2 + i). Wait, because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so their inner products are zero when different and 1 when same. So the inner product is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So let me compute each term. The coefficient for |up> is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². So (1+i) gives 1² +1² = 2.

Next, the coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So total inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so we need to normalize it by dividing by sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, multiplied by 1/sqrt(7). That makes sense.

Now the next part: calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. The operator A has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, else zero. So the matrix is 2x2 because we're dealing with |up> and |down> as the basis.

Wait, the matrix A would be for a two-level system. So in the basis |up>, |down>, the matrix is:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are hbar/2.

So this operator A is actually (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So A = (hbar/2) * σ_x.

But wait, the Pauli matrices are for spin-1/2 systems. So this operator A is proportional to the Pauli X operator.

Now, the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. Because A is a multiple of σ_x, their eigenstates are the same. The eigenstates of σ_x are the |+x> and |-x> states, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Then the square of the coefficients gives the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, let me think about that. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), but in our case, |up> and |down> are the equivalent of |0> and |1>. So yes, the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> are as I said.

So I need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

First, let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

Let me write this as a vector in the basis (|up>, |down>):

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Now, the eigenstates of A (which are |+x> and |-x>) can be written as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let me express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. Let me compute the coefficients.

Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

So, c_+ is the inner product of |alpha> and |+x>, and c_- is the inner product of |alpha> and |−x>.

Let me compute c_+ first.

c_+ = < +x | alpha >.

Which is [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by |alpha>.

So,

c_+ = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) ) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) ) ]

Wait, actually, more accurately, the inner product is:

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

Because |+x> is [ |up> + |down> ] / sqrt(2), so the inner product with |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) ) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) ) ]

So factor out 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)):

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

Compute numerator: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c_- is the inner product of |alpha> and |−x>:

c_- = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) ) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) )

= (1/(sqrt(14)) ) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Compute numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i = -1 + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

c_+ =3/sqrt(14) → |c_+|^2 =9/14.

Similarly, |c_-|^2: 

c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) =1 +4=5. So 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is about 0.642857, 5/14 is about 0.357143.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Hmm, 0.64 is about 9/14 (which is ≈0.642857), and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So the probabilities would be 9/14 and5/14, which are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

So the first part of the answer is probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, which is approx 0.64 and 0.36. That matches option A's first part. But let's check the other parts.

The second part is to find the average value of the operator A.

Average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute this as Tr(A rho), where rho is the density matrix of |alpha>.

Alternatively, compute using matrix elements.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

The expectation value of σ_x for a state can be found using the formula. Alternatively, since σ_x is (|up><down| + |down><up| ), so A = (hbar/2)( |up><down| + |down><up| ).

So <alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ <alpha| up><down |alpha> + <alpha| down><up |alpha> ]

Which is (hbar/2) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, let me compute each term.

First term: <alpha | up> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <alpha | down> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So the first part is <alpha | up><down | alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Similarly, the second term is <alpha | down><up | alpha> = [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So adding these two gives 2 * [ (1+i)(2 -i) ] / 7.

Compute (1+i)(2 -i):

= 1*2 + 1*(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i)
= 2 -i + 2i -i²
= 2 + i +1 (because i² = -1)
= 3 + i.

So 2 * (3 + i) /7 → [6 + 2i]/7.

So <alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) * [ (6 + 2i)/7 ].

But wait, wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute (1+i)(2-i):

Multiply 1*2 = 2.

1*(-i) = -i.

i *2 = 2i.

i*(-i) = -i² = -(-1)=1.

So total is 2 -i + 2i +1 = 3 +i. Correct.

So numerator is (3 +i), multiplied by 2 gives (6 + 2i), divided by 7.

So the average is (hbar/2) * (6 + 2i)/(7) ) ?

Wait, wait a minute. But A is a Hermitian operator, so its expectation value should be real. Hmm, but this is giving me a complex number. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should find the expectation value differently. Let me think again. Another approach: express the state |alpha> in the computational basis, then compute A, then compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, since A is represented by the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], the expectation value is [ |a|^2 *0 + a b* (hbar/2) + b a* (hbar/2) + |b|^2 *0 ] ?

Wait, let me write the state |alpha> as a column vector:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So the density matrix rho is |alpha><alpha|.

To compute <A>, we can compute Tr(A rho).

Alternatively, compute A acting on |alpha>, then take the inner product with |alpha>.

So let me compute A |alpha>.

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So when multiplied by |alpha>:

A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, <alpha | A | alpha> is the inner product of |alpha> and A|alpha>.

So:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So this is the sum of the two terms:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

Each term is (hbar/2) multiplied by [ (1+i)(2 -i) ] /7.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, each term is (hbar/2) times [ (1+i)(2 -i) + (2 -i)(1+i) ] /7?

Wait, no, more accurately, each term is (hbar/2) times [ (1+i)(2 -i) + (2 -i)(1+i) ] /7.

Wait, but (1+i)(2 -i) is (3 +i) as before, same as (2 -i)(1+i) = (3 +i). So adding them gives 2*(3 +i).

So (1+i)(2 -i) + (2 -i)(1+i) = 2*(3 +i) = 6 + 2i.

So the expectation value is (hbar/2) * (6 + 2i)/(7).

Wait, but that can't be right because expectation value should be real. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the inner product correctly. Let me recompute:

The first term is (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) → (hbar/2) * (1+i)(2 -i) /7.

Second term is (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) → (hbar/2) * (2 -i)(1+i) /7.

So the total is (hbar/2) [ (1+i)(2 -i) + (2 -i)(1+i) ] /7.

But (1+i)(2-i) = 3 +i, and (2 -i)(1+i) = same, 3 +i. So sum is 6 + 2i.

So expectation value is (hbar/2) * (6 +2i)/7.

Wait, but that's (3 +i) hbar /7. That can't be right because expectation values should be real for Hermitian operators. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the multiplication. Let me recompute (1+i)(2 -i):

(1+i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) +i*2 +i*(-i) = 2 -i +2i -i².

i² is -1, so -i² is +1. So 2 + i +1 = 3 + i. Correct.

Hmm, so where's the mistake? Because the expectation value is coming out as (3 + i) hbar/(2*7) → (3 +i) hbar/(14).

Wait, but that's (3/14 hbar ) + (i hbar)/14. Which is complex. But A is Hermitian, so expectation must be real. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication. Let me re-do A |alpha>.

A is a 2x2 matrix:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

|alpha> is [a, b]^T where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So A|alpha> is [0*a + (hbar/2)*b, (hbar/2)*a + 0*b] = [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

So A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Then, the inner product <alpha | A | alpha> is:

a*( (hbar/2) b ) + b*( (hbar/2) a )

= (hbar/2) [ a b* + b a* ]

Because inner product is a* times each component and sum.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify:

<alpha | A | alpha> = [ a*, b* ] * [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

So it's a* * (hbar/2) b + b* * (hbar/2) a.

Which is (hbar/2)( a* b + b* a ).

Which simplifies to (hbar/2) ( 2 Re( a* b )) ) → hbar Re( a* b ).

Ah! So I think I made a mistake earlier by not taking the complex conjugate properly.

So let's compute a* and b*.

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) → a* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) → b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

Then, a* b = [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply numerator:

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i) /7.

Similarly, b* a = [ (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply numerator:

2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 + 2i +i + i² → 2 + 3i -1 → 1 +3i.

So b* a = (1 +3i)/7.

So a* b + b* a = (1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 → (2)/7.

So Re( a* b ) = Re( (1-3i)/7 ) = (1/7).

So <A> is (hbar/2 ) * 2*(1/7) )= hbar/7.

Ah! So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Wait, this makes sense now. So the expectation value is hbar over 7.

So now, putting it all together.

The probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571, which round to 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

So the average is hbar/7, which matches option A's third part.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start with the given state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down\rangle,
\]

where the normalization factor \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \) is determined by ensuring the total probability is 1.

### Step 1: Eigenstates of the Operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is given with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x,
\]

where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up\rangle + |down\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up\rangle - |down\rangle).
\]

Thus, the eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \).

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in Terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
To compute the probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) as a linear combination of these states:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+x\rangle + c_- |-x\rangle,
\]

where the coefficients are:

\[
c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64,
\]
\[
P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 3: Average Value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( A \), we compute:

\[
A |\alpha\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \\ \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \\ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product \( \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{1-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively. The average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
