Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. So, I need to figure out the reactants and products for three different reactions labeled (A), (B), and (C). Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll look at reaction (A): dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile (enolate) attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Wait, in the Michael reaction, the enolate is the nucleophile. So dimethyl malonate is a good candidate to form the enolate because it's a diester, which is a good electron sink. The base, NaOEt, would deprotonate the malonate at the alpha position, forming an enolate. Then this enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituents in the E configuration. Wait, actually, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but I think the correct structure is CH2=CH- where the acrylate is. Hmm, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but the E configuration would mean the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. Wait, no, wait. The compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think. The structure of an acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon from the ester group. Wait, the carbonyl is at the end. So the structure would be CH2-C(O)OCH3 with a substituent on the second carbon. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, maybe the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, so it's CH2-CH2, but
