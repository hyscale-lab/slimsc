Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function. Let me see what I remember.

The problem states that each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Oh wait, maybe that's a complex wave function. But when you have a wave function in quantum mechanics, especially for a particle's position, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. Right, the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

But wait, the way the wave function is written here, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So that would be a complex number, with real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part -0.5. So the absolute square would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) multiplied by its complex conjugate (a/sqrt(1+x) +0.5i) gives the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. The integral of |ψ|² dx over all space must equal 1. So I need to integrate |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 because the particles are only found between 1 and 3.

Wait, the problem says that when they measured the position, none were found at x<1 or x>3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside of 1 and 3. Hmm, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside of 1 and 3, then how does it fit with this expression? Unless the wave function is zero elsewhere, but in the region between 1 and 3, it's that expression. That's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, which aligns with the measurement results. So the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i between x=1 and x=3, and zero
