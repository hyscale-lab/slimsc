Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question is about the momentum a photon needs to have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. Let me think about what I know.

The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think means it's a non-rigid rotor. Oh wait, no, waitâ€”wait, wait. No, wait. The non-rigid rotor model is the vibration part. Or maybe the question refers to the rotation part. Hmm. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is for rotation, and the rigid rotor is when the bond length is fixed. But considering the question mentions the bond length as 2 angstroms, but also the angular frequency of vibration, I think this is a diatomic that has both rotational and vibrational energy states.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually means the lowest energy state. So, the ground state. Now, when it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next lowest energy state. So, what's the next state? Well, I think the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So, the next state would probably be increasing either the vibrational or rotational quantum number.

Wait, but what's the order of energy levels here? For diatomic molecules, the rotational levels are usually much closer together than vibrational levels, right? Because vibrations have higher energy due to higher frequencies. So, the energy spacing between vibrational states is larger than that between rotational states. But wait, the question says the molecule is in the
