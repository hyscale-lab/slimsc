Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think step by step.

So the question says that there are two stars with the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So when the planet pulls the star towards us, the spectral lines shift to shorter wavelengths (blue shift), and when it pulls away, the lines shift to longer wavelengths (red shift). The periodic shifts tell us about the planet's orbit.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, so the shift is larger for Planet #2. I remember that the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the characteristics of the orbit.

The formula I think I need is the one that relates the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital period (P). The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^0.5 * (1 - e^2)^0.5 ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should consider a simplified version since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are much more massive (like the Sun). So M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the mass of the star. Also, since both orbits are circular, e=0, so the (1-e²)^0.5 term is 1.

So the formula simplifies. Let me think again. Oh wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) * (1 + (M_p/M_*))^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, the (1 + M_p/M_*) term is approximately 1, so it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ) * (1/( (2π)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is also given by the formula:

K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But again, since M_* >> M_p, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and sin i is approximately 1 (edge-on orbit assumed, which is usually the case for RV detection to get maximum velocity). So simplifying:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between K and P. Since both stars have the same mass, M_*, and the planets are similar in mass, M_p. So the ratio of K for planet 2 to K for planet
