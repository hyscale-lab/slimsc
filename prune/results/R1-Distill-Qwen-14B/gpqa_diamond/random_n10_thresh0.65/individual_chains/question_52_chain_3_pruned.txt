Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When the spots aren't present, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. Observations show that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—comparing when there are no spots to when there are spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann factor is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but the ratio in the problem is n_1 / n_2. So, let's say the ratio when no spots is R1, and when spots are present, it's R2. The question says R1 is observed to be higher than R2 because the ratio decreases when spots are present. So the factor is R1/R2.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So when spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K. So the ratio when the star doesn't have spots (higher T) is compared to when it does (lower T). But the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R1 is higher than R2.

So I need to compute (n1/n2)_6000K / (n1/n2)_5500K.

Let me write the ratio for each case. Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both levels (if not specified, perhaps they are the same or given as same?), but the problem doesn't mention them, so maybe I can assume g1/g2 is 1. Or perhaps it's given as a different factor, but since it's not specified, I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, the ratio R = (n1/n2) = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, wait—no. The Boltzmann equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if E1 is higher than E2, then (E1 - E2) is positive. Let's say the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that fits in. Wait, the energy of a photon is E = hc/lambda. So the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/lambda. Or is it E1 - E2? Because when an atom absorbs a
