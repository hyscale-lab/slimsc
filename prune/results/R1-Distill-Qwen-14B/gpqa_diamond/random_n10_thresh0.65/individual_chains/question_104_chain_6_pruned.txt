Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, right?

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets detected using RV. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So Neptune is less massive than Jupiter, but more than Earth. But wait, does the mass of the planet affect the RV signal? I think it does. The RV signal depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period, among other things.

The problem gives me the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. I'm supposed to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The formula I recall is that the semi-amplitude K is given by (V) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (P) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) ) )^(1/3). But maybe there's a simpler way since the stars are similar to the Sun, so M_star is the same for both. And the planets have similar masses to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both as well.

Wait, the problem says both have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both. So perhaps the variation in the RV signal (the velocity semi-amplitude) depends on other factors. Oh, because the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. So the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ). But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, the (1 + M_p/M_star) term is approximately 1. So K is roughly proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))).

But since the planets are in circular orbits, e is zero, so that term is 1. So K ~ M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, but both stars have the same mass, and both planets have similar masses. So M_p for both is
