Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and then figuring out the final product. Let's start by looking at the data provided.

The IR and NMR data are given. I'm a bit rusty on interpreting these, but I'll try. Let's look at the IR first. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-¹, 1720 cm-¹, 1610 cm-¹, and 1450 cm-¹. 

IR peaks can tell me about functional groups. The 3400-2500 region usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. Since it's a broad region, maybe an O-H stretch from a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester? Or maybe an alcohol. Wait, but the 1720 cm-¹ is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl (C=O). So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. 

Wait, what about the 1610 and 1450 regions? Those are around the areas for aromatic C=C stretching. So compound X probably has an aromatic ring.

Now, the NMR data. Let's list out the peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)
8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
7.2 ppm (d, 2H)
2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

Starting with the aromatic region, looking at the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm doublets. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and give a doublet each. So the aromatic ring has two substituents opposite each other.

The other peaks: the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. That's a high chemical shift, so likely an O-H proton. But wait, if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid O-H. Carboxylic acids have broad peaks, so that fits. So perhaps the compound has a carboxylic acid group? But wait, earlier in the IR, the carbonyl is at 1720, which is a bit high for a ketone or maybe a conjugated carbonyl? Wait, a ketone is around 1700-1750. Carboxylic acids are about 1700 but can be lower if conjugated. Hmm.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would make sense. So maybe the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but looking at the other NMR peaks. Let's think about the rest. The 2.9 ppm
