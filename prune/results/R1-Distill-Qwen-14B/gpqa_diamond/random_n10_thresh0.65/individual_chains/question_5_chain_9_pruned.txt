Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components of P—Px, Py, Pz—as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, what's the operator P? Oh right, P is a vector operator, so it has components in x, y, z. The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator P·n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, will have this eigenvector with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Hmm, but wait, how do you represent an operator along an arbitrary direction? I remember that when you have an operator in an arbitrary direction, you can express it in terms of its components. So, the operator P along direction n would be P · n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

But n is in the x-z plane, so n_y = 0. Oh wait, no—the x-z plane is where the direction vector n lies. So, any direction in x-z plane can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle. Because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane is when the angle phi is zero or 180 degrees. So, yeah, n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since y-component is zero.

So the operator P·n would be (P_x * sinθ) + (P_z * cosθ). Because the y-component of n is zero, so Py doesn't contribute.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

But wait, P is a vector operator, so P·n is (ħ/2) times (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), where σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, but each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) times their respective matrices. So P·n would be (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), since n_y is
