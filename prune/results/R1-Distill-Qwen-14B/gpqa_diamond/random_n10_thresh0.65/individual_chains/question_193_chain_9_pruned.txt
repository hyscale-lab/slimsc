Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. The given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ‚àù 1/plx^5. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d. So if I have parallax, and I want to express things in terms of distance, I can substitute plx with 1/d. 

But the question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance. So the problem states that N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant.

Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N = k * (d)^5. Oh wait, wait, no. Because 1/(plx) is d. So (1/plx)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. The number of stars as a function of distance. So the question is about the number of stars in a region as you move further away. So say, if you consider a shell at a certain distance r, how does the number
