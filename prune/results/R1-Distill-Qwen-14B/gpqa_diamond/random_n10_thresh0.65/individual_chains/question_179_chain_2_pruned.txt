Okay, so I've got this question about quantum mechanics and matrices. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

The question presents four matrices W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are A, B, C, D, and I need to choose the correct statement about them.

First, I should recall some quantum mechanics concepts. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator is a unitary matrix, which means its conjugate transpose multiplied by itself equals the identity matrix. Also, the exponential of a matrix, like e^X, would be a unitary operator if X is skew-Hermitian (since for unitary U, U† U = I, and if U = e^X, then X must be i times a Hermitian matrix).

Looking at the options:

Option A: There exists a vector where multiplying by e^X changes the norm. Hmm. So if e^X is unitary, then multiplying any vector by it preserves the norm. Because unitary operators preserve inner products, so the norm (length) remains the same. So if e^X is unitary, then this statement would be false. But if e^X is not unitary, then it could change the norm. So I need to check if X is a skew-Hermitian matrix. Because if X is, then e^X will be unitary.

What's a Hermitian matrix? A matrix H is Hermitian if H† = H. A skew-Hermitian matrix S satisfies S† = -S. The exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary because if S is skew-Hermitian, then e^S is unitary.

So let me check if X is skew-Hermitian.

Looking at matrix X:

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Let me compute X† (the conjugate transpose). The conjugate of each element:

Row 1 (original columns): i → -i, -1 → -1, 2i → -2i.
So first row of X† is [-i, -1, -2i].

Row 2 of X is [1, 0, 1], so when conjugated and transposed, it becomes [-1*, 0*, 1*]? Wait, no. To get the conjugate transpose, you first take the conjugate of each element, then transpose (swap rows and columns).

Wait, wait. Let's do it step by step.

X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Conjugate each element:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1 (since 1 is real)
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then transpose to get X†. So the transpose of X would have columns as rows.

Original X:
Column 1: i, 1, 2i
Column 2: -1, 0, -1
Column3: 2i, 1, -i

After conjugation:
Column 1 becomes: -i, 1, -2i
Column 2: -1,0,-1
Column3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write out X†:

X† is:

[-i, 1, 2i;
 -1, 0, -1;
 -2i, 1, i ]

Wait, no. Wait, when I take the conjugate of X, each element becomes its complex conjugate.

So X's elements:

(1,1): i → -i
(1,2): -1 → -1
(1,3): 2i → -2i

(2,1): 1 →1
(2,2):0 →0
(2,3):1 →1

(3,1):2i →-2i
(3,2):-1 →-1
(3,3):-i →i

Then, the transpose of this conjugated matrix is X†. So the first row of X† is the conjugate of the first column of X.

First column of X after conjugation:
Row 1: -i
Row 2:1
Row3: -2i

So first row of X† is [-i, 1, -2i]

Second column of X after conjugation:
Row1: -1
Row2:0
Row3: -1

So second row of X† is [-1, 0, -1]

Third column of X after conjugation:
Row1: -2i
Row2:1
Row3:i

So third row of X† is [-2i, 1, i]

So X† is:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i
Row2: -1, 0, -1
Row3: -2i, 1, i

Now, check if X† equals -X.

-X would be:

-X is:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i → same as X's first row multiplied by -1.

Wait, X is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i → -X row1: -i, 1, -2i → which matches X† row1.

Similarly
