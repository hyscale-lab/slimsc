Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and they mention that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex properly. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is just standard conditions. The given equilibrium constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Hmm, right.

So, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent and forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is written as CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation of this complex is governed by an equilibrium, and the stability constant (K) tells us how strong the complex is.

The formula for the formation of the complex is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. So, the equilibrium expression would be K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). 

Wait, but in this problem, we're given the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, it will release some Ca²+ and EDTA^4− into the solution. 

I think the key here is that the complex dissociates according to the equilibrium, and we can find the concentrations of the ions using K. But wait, since K is so large (5e10), that means the equilibrium favors the formation of the complex. So, the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4− is very little. So, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− in solution will be very small compared to the concentration of the complex.

Let me think about the expression again. K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Rearranging, [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²−]/(K * [EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but I don't know the concentration of EDTA^4−. Oh,
