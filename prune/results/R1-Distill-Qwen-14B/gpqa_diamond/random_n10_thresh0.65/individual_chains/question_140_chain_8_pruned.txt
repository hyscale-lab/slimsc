Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully again.

The question says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I think I need to identify what Substance X might be. Since it's used in organic chemistry and reacts violently, maybe it's something like a strong base or a metal that reacts exothermically.

The reaction with liquid Y produces gas W. Let's think about possible reactions. Liquid Y could be something like water. If X is a metal, like sodium or potassium, reacting with water (liquid Y) would produce hydrogen gas (W). But wait, gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Hydrogen has one proton and no neutrons, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: maybe W is CO2. Carbon has 6 protons and 8 neutrons in its most common isotope. But wait, the problem says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think. For CO2, each molecule has 2 oxygen atoms. But the molecule itself would have more protons and neutrons. Let me see: CO2's molecule has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons in the most common isotope) and two O (8 protons each, 8 neutrons each). But that's not just the molecule, the count per atom.

Wait, maybe W is a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. For example, H2O: each oxygen has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (if it's ^16O). So each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. But in H2O, the molecule as a whole doesn't have same number of protons and neutrons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe W is NH3. Nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (since ^14N is common). So each NH3 molecule has 1 N and 3 H. So per N atom, protons =7, neutrons=7. So each N in W contributes equally. Then
