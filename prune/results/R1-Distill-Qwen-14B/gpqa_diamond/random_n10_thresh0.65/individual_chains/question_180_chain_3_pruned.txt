Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible. So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, in Joules.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this has to do with electrostatic potential energy because we're dealing with charges and their arrangement. Since the system is isolated, I don't think external work is a factor here. But wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. I remember that potential energy in configurations of charges can vary, and sometimes the minimum energy corresponds to a certain arrangement, like when the charges are placed in a way that minimizes repulsion.

Wait, but all the charges are positive because each is 2e, and e is the elementary charge which is positive. So, like charges repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, I think the charges should be as close as possible, but in this setup, 12 are fixed at a distance from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

Wait, no, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so the other 12 are each at 2 meters away from P. So the 13th charge is at the center,
