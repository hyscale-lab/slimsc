Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, a rhombohedral structure—wait, isn't that a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal and the angles are all the same? Oh right, it's also sometimes called a trigonal crystal system, I think. So for this problem, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. Wait, no, wait. The interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, but in a crystal, especially a rhombohedral one, I think the lattice parameter 'a' is the edge length of the unit cell. So maybe in this case, the interatomic distance is the same as 'a' since it's a primitive lattice? Or wait, no, interatomic distance can sometimes refer to the distance between neighboring atoms, which might be the same as the lattice parameter in a simple cubic structure, but rhombohedral is a bit more complex.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So that's 'a' in this case. Because in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are equal. So 'a' would be the length of each edge of the rhombohedron. So interatomic distance is 'a' =10 Angstrom.

Now, the problem is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) in a crystal is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (2 hk cos α)/(h + k) - (2 hl cos β)/(h + l) - (2 kl cos γ)/(k + l) ) )

Wait, no, wait. Maybe I'm mixing up some formulas. Or perhaps the general formula is different. Let me think. For a general crystal system, the interplanar distance formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - a^2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) )^(1/2) / ( (hkl) (something) ) )

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I remember that for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for a more general crystal system, like rhombohedral which isn't cubic, the formula is more complicated.

I think the general formula for d is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) ]^(-1/2) / (h k l) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should look up the correct formula. Alternatively, I might recall that the formula involves the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by some terms involving the cosines of the angles.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, no, wait. That can't be right because in the cubic case, when α=β=γ=90 degrees, cos α etc. are zero, so it reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct. So for a cubic system, that's right. So in our case, the angles are 30 degrees each. So substituting in the formula, I can compute the denominator.

Wait, but wait a second, I'm thinking that the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (1/√(h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ))) ) / (a^2) ?

No, not quite. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a^2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)) ]^{-1/2} / (hkl) ?

No, that doesn't seem right because the dimensions wouldn't match. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula in terms of the reciprocal lattice vectors or the metric tensor.

Another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula derived from the metric tensor. The metric tensor g is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal elements are a², a², a², and the off-diagonal elements are a² cos α, a² cos β, a² cos γ, but I might be mixing the exact positions.

Wait, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral crystal (which is a special case of a triclinic crystal) is given by:

g = |  a²      a² cos γ   a² cos β  |
    | a² cos γ  a²        a² cos α |
    | a² cos β  a² cos α   a²        |

Wait, no, I think that's a bit off. The general metric tensor for a triclinic system is:

g_11 = a²
g_12 = g_21 = a b cos γ
g_13 = g_31 = a c cos β
g_22 = b²
g_23 = g_32 = b c cos α
g_33 = c²

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are equal: α = β = γ = θ (in this case, 30 degrees). So substituting, the metric tensor becomes:

g_11 = a²
g_12 = g_21 = a² cos θ
g_13 = g_31 = a² cos θ
g_22 = a²
g_23 = g_32 = a² cos θ
g_33 = a²

Now, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 g_33) + (k^2 g_22) + (l^2 g_11) - (h k (g_23 + g_32)) - (h l (g_13 + g_31)) - (k l (g_12 + g_21)) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to find the plane's normal vector and compute the reciprocal. Alternatively, the formula for d is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 hk cos α' - 2 hl cos β' - 2 kl cos γ' ) )

Wait, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Maybe the formula is:

d^2 = ( a^2 (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )^{-1}

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)) ]^{-1/2}

So, substituting for our case:

h, k, l are 1,1,1.

So,

d = [ a² (1 +1 +1) - 2 a² ( (1)(1) cos 30 + (1)(1) cos 30 + (1)(1) cos 30 ) ) ]^(-1/2 )

Wait, because α, β, γ are 30 degrees each. So let me compute that step by step.

First, compute (h² +k² + l²) = 1+1+1 =3.

Then, the sum inside the parentheses is:

2 a² [ (hk cos α) + (hl cos β) + (kl cos gamma) ]

But wait, in our formula, each term is multiplied by 2 a², and then each hk, etc. is multiplied by cos of the angle between those axes.

Wait, let me correct that. The formula is:

d^2 = [ a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ]^{-1}

Wait no, d_{hkl} = [ a² (h² +k² + l²) - 2 a² ( hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma ) ]^{-1/2}

Wait, no, that would be the reciprocal, but wait, perhaps I should write it correctly.

Wait, let me think again. The correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (1 / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )) ) ) * (a^2)

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's better to refer to the general formula for d:

d_{hkl} = (1/√(h² +k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma))) ) * (1/a)

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a^2 ( hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma )) ]^{-1/2 }

So, substituting our values:

h=1, k=1, l=1,

α=β=γ=30°, a=10 Å.

Compute each part:

h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 =3.

The sum inside the second term: hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma.

Each of these terms is (1*1)*cos(30°) = (1) * (√3/2) ≈ 0.8660.

So, each of the three terms is 0.8660.

So the sum is 3 * (1 * 1) * cos(30°) = 3 * 0.8660 ≈ 2.5981.

Multiply that by 2a²:

Wait, no, the formula is:

d = [ a^2 (3) - 2 a^2 (2.5981) ) ]^{-1/2 }

Wait, because:

sum inside the 2a^2 is (hk cos α + ... ) = 3 * (0.8660) ≈2.5981.

So,

d = [ a² (3 - 2 * 2.5981) ) ]^{-1/2 }

Wait, because the formula is a² times (3) minus 2a² times (2.5981), which is a² [ 3 - 2*(2.5981) ].

Wait, 3 - 2*(2.5981) = 3 -5.1962 = -2.1962.

Wait, but that would give a negative inside the square root. Which isn't possible. That can't be right because the interplanar distance can't be imaginary.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the correct formula is:

d = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) ) ]^(-1/2) * (a^2) ? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( ( (h a)^2 + (k b)^2 + (l c)^2 ) - 2 h k a b cos gamma - 2 h l a c cos beta - 2 k l b c cos alpha ) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta.

So substituting, we have:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² a² + k² a² + l² a²) - 2 h k a² cos theta - 2 h l a² cos theta - 2 k l a² cos theta )

= 1 / sqrt( a² [ h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ] )

= (1/a) * sqrt( 1 / [ h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ] )

Wait, that seems more plausible. So,

d = (1/a) * sqrt( 1 / [ ... ] )

Wait, no, the formula is:

d = [ a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 a^2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) ]^{-1/2}

Wait, but in this case, since alpha = beta = gamma =30°, and a = b = c.

So, substituting,

d = [ a² (3) - 2 a² (1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos30 ) ]^{-1/2}

= [ a² (3 - 2 * 3 * cos30 ) ]^{-1/2}

Wait, 3 comes from (1*1 +1*1 +1*1) =3. So,

3 - 2*(3 * cos30) = 3 - 6 cos30.

Cos30 is approx 0.8660.

So,

3 -6*0.8660 = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Which is negative, so that can't be right. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Maybe the formula is:

d = [ a² (h² +k² +l^2) + 2 a² ( hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma ) ]^{-1/2}

Wait, that would make the denominator positive. Let me test that.

So,

3 + 2*(3 * 0.866) = 3 + 5.196=8.196.

So,

d = [ a² (8.196) ]^{-1/2} = 1/(a sqrt(8.196)).

a is 10 Angstrom.

sqrt(8.196) is approximately sqrt(8.196)= 2.863.

So,

d=1/(10 * 2.863) = 1/28.63 ≈ 0.0349 Angstrom.

Wait, that can't be right because the interplanar distance is much smaller than the interatomic distance, but 0.03 Angstrom is way too small. That's not matching the options given, which are around 9 Angstrom.

Hmm, so perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me try to think differently.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance can be computed using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + (h +k + l)² (cos α cos beta cos gamma) - ... )

No, that's probably not correct. Let me think about the Miller indices for the (111) plane.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Wait, but theta is the angle between the axes. But in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so theta is 30 degrees.

So,

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2*(3) cos30 )

Wait,

3 - 6 * cos30 = 3 - 6*(√3/2) = 3 - 3√3 ≈ 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative again. So that can't be correct.

Hmm. I must be using the wrong formula. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, I found a resource that says the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta + 2(h +k + l)^2 \cos^2\theta - 2(h +k + l)(hk + hl + kl) \cos^3theta}} }

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula from the structure factor, but that might not be helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (h +k + l) ( (cos α + cos β + cos gamma)/2 ) )

Wait, but that's a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The reciprocal metric tensor g' is given by the inverse of the metric tensor g. The elements of the reciprocal tensor g'^{ij} are such that sum_{k} g^{ik} g'^{kj} = delta^{ij}.

But this might be more involved. Let me try to compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

For a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = A, and angles alpha=beta=gamma=θ=30°, the metric tensor g is:

g_11 = A^2
g_12 = g_21 = A^2 cos θ
g_13 = g_31 = A^2 cos θ
g_22 = A^2
g_23 = g_32 = A^2 cos θ
g_33 = A^2

To find the reciprocal metric tensor, we need to compute the inverse of this matrix. Since it's a symmetric matrix, the inverse can be computed using the formula for a 3x3 matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the reciprocal tensor for a rhombohedral system can be written as:

g'^{11} = (1 + 2 cos θ) / (1 - cos θ)
g'^{22} = (1 + 2 cos θ) / (1 - cos θ)
g'^{33} = (1 + 2 cos θ) / (1 - cos θ)
g'^{12} = g'^{21} = ( - (1 + 2 cos θ) ) / (1 - cos θ)
g'^{13} = g'^{31} = ( - (1 + 2 cos θ) ) / (1 - cos θ)
g'^{23} = g'^{32} = ( - (1 + 2 cos θ) ) / (1 - cos θ)

Wait, is that correct? Not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

Then, the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( h^2 g'^{11} + k^2 g'^{22} + l^2 g'^{33} + 2 h k g'^{12} + 2 h l g'^{13} + 2 k l g'^{23} )

So for the (111) plane,

h=k=l=1.

Substituting,

d^2 = 1 / [ (1)^2 g'^{11} + (1)^2 g'^{22} + (1)^2 g'^{33} + 2*1*1 g'^{12} + 2*1*1 g'^{13} + 2*1*1 g'^{23} ) ]

So,

d^2 = 1 / [ g'^{11} + g'^{22} + g'^{33} + 2 g'^{12} + 2 g'^{13} + 2 g'^{23} ]

Now substituting the values from the reciprocal tensor:

g'^{11}=g'^{22}=g'^{33}= (1 + 2 cosθ)/(1 - cosθ)

g'^{12}=g'^{13}=g'^{23}= [ - (1 + 2 cosθ) ] / (1 - cosθ)

So,

Sum = 3 * [ (1 + 2 cosθ)/(1 - cosθ) ] + 2*(3) * [ - (1 + 2 cosθ)/(1 - cosθ) ]

Because there are three terms from g'^{11}, etc., and three terms from the cross terms, each multiplied by 2.

So,

Sum = [3 (1 + 2 cosθ) - 6 (1 + 2 cosθ) ] / (1 - cosθ )

Simplify numerator:

3(1 + 2 cosθ) -6(1 + 2 cosθ) = (3 -6)(1 + 2 cosθ) = (-3)(1 +2 cosθ)

So,

Sum = [ (-3)(1 + 2 cosθ) ] / (1 - cosθ )

Thus,

d^2 = 1 / [ (-3)(1 + 2 cosθ) / (1 - cosθ) ) ] = [ (1 - cosθ) ) / ( -3 (1 + 2 cosθ) ) ]

Wait, but that gives a negative value in the denominator, which would make d^2 negative, which is impossible. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, perhaps the reciprocal tensor expressions I used are incorrect. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Another idea: in a rhombohedral system, the volume of the unit cell (V) is given by:

V = a^3 (1 - cosθ)^{3/2} (1 + 2 cosθ)

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. The general formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = (1/√[(h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)] ) * (1/a)

Wait, no, that would give a value in inverse angstroms squared, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should refer back to the cubic formula. In a cubic system with angles 90°, d is a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²).

In our case, the angles are 30°, which are much smaller, so the interplanar distance should be larger than in the cubic case. Because the unit cell is more compressed along the diagonals.

Wait, wait, no. Let's think: if the angles are smaller, the unit cell is more elongated. So the actual interplanar distances might be shorter or longer depending on the plane.

Wait, but in this problem, the angles are 30°, which are acute, so the lattice is more 'expanded' in some directions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator correctly. Let me try again with the formula:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ) * a^2

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a^2) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, but if a=10, then for (111), let's compute the denominator.

Denominator inside the square root:

3 - 2*( (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 )

= 3 - 6*(√3/2 )

= 3 - 3√3 ≈ 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so d would be imaginary. That's impossible. So this formula can't be correct.

Hmm. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula altogether. Let me think about this differently. Perhaps I should consider the structure of the rhombohedral lattice.

A rhombohedral lattice can be thought of as a cube with a distortion along the space diagonal. The (111) plane would have a certain interplanar distance, but because of the distortion, it's not the same as in a cubic system.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a general hexagonal system isn't applicable here, but rhombohedral is a special case of hexagonal? No, it's a special case of triclinic.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d^2 = (a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( (h +k + l)^2 - (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (1 - cosθ)^2 ) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula from the book "X-ray Structure Determination" by L. S. Miller, which outlines the formula for d in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, I found a formula in some notes that says:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

But we saw that this gives a negative denominator.

Wait, but perhaps in reality, cosθ is negative. Oh wait, no, theta is 30 degrees, so cos theta is positive 0.866.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a minus sign in the formula. Let me consider that.

If the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Then for (111):

denominator = 3 + 2*(3) * 0.866 ≈ 3 + 5.196 =8.196

So,

d = 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10 / 2.863 ≈3.492 Angstrom.

But the options are around 9 Angstrom. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula has a negative sign in front of the cosine terms:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But that leads to a negative denominator as before, which is a problem.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) - (2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma )) )

But given that in rhombohedral, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so:

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2*(3 * (1)(1) cos30) )

= 10 / sqrt(3 - 6*0.866)

=10 / sqrt(3 -5.196)

=10 / sqrt(-2.196)

Which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order of the terms. Let me think about the formula for the general case.

Wait, I found another source that says the general formula for interplanar spacing is:

d_{hkl} = (1/√(h² +k² +l^2 - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos gamma )) ) / (a^2)

Wait, but that would give 1/(a^2) multiplied by sqrt(...), which would be in inverse Angstrom squared. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) ]^{-1/2} * (a^2)

But with a=10,

So,

d = (a^2) / sqrt(3 - 2(3 * cos30)) )

= (100) / sqrt(3 - 6 * 0.866 )

= 100 / sqrt(3 -5.196 )=100 / sqrt(-2.196).

Which is imaginary. So that can't be.

I'm clearly stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is easier if I model the rhombohedral lattice as a cube with a diagonal distortion. The (111) plane in a cube has a certain interplanar distance, and the distortion would change that.

In a cube with edge length a, the interplanar distance for (111) is a√3. So for a=10, that would be 10√3 ≈17.32 Angstrom. But our options are around 9, so perhaps the distortion caused by the angles reduces this distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the rhombohedral structure can be considered as a sheared cube. The (111) plane would have a different spacing because of the shear.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (2 hk cos α) - (2 hl cos β) - (2 kl cos gamma) )

But as before, this gives a negative value.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the formula in terms of the unit cell's volume.

The unit cell volume V of a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta )

Wait, with theta=30 degrees,

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute cos(30)=√3/2 ≈0.866.

So,

1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3

=1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495)

=1 -2.25 +1.299

= (1 +1.299) -2.25 =2.299 -2.25 =0.049.

So,

V = a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a^3 *0.2214.

But I'm not sure how this helps with the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * 1 / sqrt( 1 - 2 cos theta + ... )

But this is getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the relation between the interplanar distance and the lattice parameters in a rhombohedral system.

After some research, I found that the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta}},

where θ is the angle between the edges.

Wait, but as before, this gives a negative denominator when θ=30 degrees and h=k=l=1.

So, perhaps this formula is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the angles.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angle between the edges is 180-30=150 degrees. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the angles can be either acute or obtuse, depending on the handedness. But I think in this problem, the angles are given as 30°, so that's the case.

Wait, let me compute the denominator again, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Denominator:

h² +k² +l² =3.

2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ = 2*(3)*cos30 =6 * 0.8660≈5.196.

So,

3 -5.196≈-2.196.

Which is negative. So the formula can't apply here.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is correct, but only applicable when the denominator is positive. So maybe for certain hkl indices, the denominator is positive, but for others, it's not. But in our case, it's negative, so perhaps this (111) plane doesn't exist, but that can't be the case because the question asks for it.

Wait, but the problem says it's a rhombohedral crystal, so the (111) plane must exist. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for d uses the reciprocal, so:

d_{hkl} = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl +kl) cos theta )^{-1}.

Wait, so for our case,

d=10 * sqrt( (3 + 6 * 0.866 ) )^{-1}.

=10 * sqrt( (3 +5.196 ))^{-1}

=10 * sqrt(8.196)^{-1}

=10 / (2.863 )

≈3.49 Angstrom.

But this is not close to any of the given options. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

But as before, this gives a negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a^2) / sqrt( h^2 (b^2 + c^2 - 2 bc cos alpha ) + ... ) )

But in the rhombohedral case, a=b=c, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos gamma - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos alpha )

But wait, the angles might not all be the same. Oh no, in this problem, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so substituting,

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

Again, same problem.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which would give 3 +5.196=8.196, denominator=2.863, so d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But that's not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral lattice can be determined using the relation d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta ) )

But since this gives a negative denominator, perhaps I should take the absolute value.

Wait, that would give d = 10 / sqrt(2.196 ) ≈10 /1.481 ≈6.75 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are around 9 Angstrom. So maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a^2) / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which gives:

a=10, so a^2=100.

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 +5.196=8.196.

So,

d=100 / sqrt(8.196)≈100/2.863≈34.92 Angstrom.

No, that's way too big.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which would be 10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely. Maybe I should consider the reciprocal of (hkl) plane.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos \alpha - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos gamma }} \cdot \frac{1}{a}

Wait, but that would give a value in inverse angstroms, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos \alpha - 2hl \cos beta - 2kl cos gamma } } \cdot \frac{1}{a²}

But again, I'm not sure.

I'm clearly stuck, so perhaps I should try to look for an alternative approach. Let me think about the unit vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the unit vectors can be defined as:

a = a * (1, 0, 0 )

b = a * ( cosθ, sinθ, 0 )

c = a * ( cosθ, (cosθ * cosφ - sinθ * sinψ ), cosθ * sinφ + sinθ * cosψ )

But in a rhombohedral system, φ=ψ=θ, I think, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice. The plane intercepts the axes at (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a), but with the distortion.

The normal vector to the (111) plane is along (1,1,1). The distance from the origin to the plane is given by the formula:

d = (a ) / sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 - 2(1)(1) cos α - 2(1)(1) cos beta - 2(1)(1) cos gamma )

Wait, but that brings us back to the same problem as before.

Given that the angles are 30 degrees, the formula gives a negative denominator.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the angles are the angles between the axes, but in the formula, the angles are used with a different convention, like 180 -30=150 degrees. Let me try that.

So, if theta=150 degrees, cos(theta)= cos(150)= -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

Substituting,

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*(-0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196 )

=10 / sqrt(8.196) =10/2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated as:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) ) / sqrt( ... )

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for the formula in a textbook or online.

Upon checking, I find that the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is indeed:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta}},

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors.

But wait, in our case, substituting h=k=l=1, and theta=30°, we get a negative inside the square root. So that suggests that the (111) plane doesn't exist, which contradicts the problem statement.

But the problem states that it is a rhombohedral crystal and asks for the (111) plane's interplanar distance. So perhaps I made a mistake in the angles.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are not the angles between the vectors, but the angles within the unit cell.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos gamma) )

Which, for our case, would be:

d =10 / sqrt(3 - 2 [ (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 ] )

=10 / sqrt(3 -6*(0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(3 -5.196 )

=10 / sqrt(-2.196)

Which is imaginary, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, I found a resource that says for rhombohedral systems, the interplanar distance formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(h +k +l)^2 (cos \theta)^2 - 4(h +k +l)(hk + hl + kl) cos^3 theta} }

But that seems overly complicated and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl +kl) cos theta + 2 (h +k +l)^2 cos^2 theta - 4 (h +k +l)(hk + hl + kl) cos^3 theta } }

But this seems too complex, and without knowing the exact formula, I'm stuck.

Given the time I've spent without progress, perhaps I should make an educated guess. The options are around 9 Angstrom, which is close to a*sqrt(3) (about 17.32) divided by 2. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( sqrt( (h +k +l)^2 - (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (1 - cos theta)^2 ) )

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (h +k +l)^2 (cos theta)^2 )

Which for (111):

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 9*(0.866)^2 )

=10 / sqrt(3 - 9*(0.75) )

=10 / sqrt(3 -6.75 )

=10 / sqrt(-3.75) → again imaginary.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should look for the correct formula in a textbook example. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is derived from a different approach.

Wait, given that all the angles are 30 degrees, perhaps the formula can be simplified. Let me try to compute the denominator again, but perhaps I made a mistake in cos30.

Wait, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So,

Denominator =3 - 6 * cos30 =3 -5.196≈-2.196.

But that's negative.

Wait, perhaps I should take the absolute value of the denominator. So,

d=10 / sqrt(2.196)≈10/1.481≈6.75 Angstrom. Still, not matching the options.

Another thought: Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which would give 3 +5.196=8.196,

d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

Hmm, but this is not matching any options.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But since all angles are 30 degrees,

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 6*(0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(-2.196) → imaginary.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should pick the option that is approximately a/sqrt(1), which would be 10 Angstrom. But option D is 10.05, so that's close. But that would only be the case if the denominator is 1. But that would require the terms to sum to zero, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Perhaps I should use the inverse of the reciprocal lattice spacing.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is given by:

h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2 hk cos alpha + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos gamma = (a d_{hkl})^{-2}

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula. So,

(a d_{hkl})^{-2} = h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2 hk cos alpha + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos gamma.

So,

d_{hkl} = 1/(a sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2 hk cos alpha + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos gamma ) )

For (111):

d=1/(10 * sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*0.866) )

=1/(10 * sqrt(3 +5.196) )

=1/(10 * sqrt(8.196) )

≈1/(10 *2.863)=1/28.63≈0.0349 Angstrom.

Which is way too small.

But perhaps I swapped the formula. Maybe it's:

d_{hkl} = 1/ (a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2 hk cos alpha + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos gamma ) )

Which would give:

d=1/(100 *8.196 )=1/819.6≈0.001219 Angstrom.

Hmm, no. I'm clearly not getting the right formula. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on the options.

Another approach: The interplanar distance for (111) in a simple cubic structure is a√3. Since the problem's options are around 9, which is about 10 * 0.9, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a√(1/3) ≈5.77, but that's not the case.

Wait, in a cubic system, d= a/√3 ≈3.2 for a=10, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, the options given are:

A)9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

Hmm, all are around 9. So perhaps the correct calculation results in a value around 9.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which for (111) and theta=30 degrees,

Denominator=3+6*0.866≈8.196,

So,

d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. No, that's not close to 9.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the angles being 30 degrees are not the angles between the edges, but some other angles. Maybe the formula uses a different angle. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(180-30) )

Which would be cos(150 degrees)= -0.866.

So,

Denominator=3 -6*(-0.866)=3+5.196=8.196,

d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options. Since the correct formula isn't working out, perhaps the intended answer is option B)8.95 Angstrom. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l² - 2(h +k +l) cos theta )

But for (111), that would be 3 -6 cos30=3-5.196=-2.196, which is negative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (h +k + l)(cos theta) )

Which for (111) is:

3 + 2*3 *0.866 ≈3 +5.196=8.196,

d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time. I'll have to go with the option that is approximately 10 / sqrt(1.0), which is 10 Angstrom, but that's option D. However, that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstrom.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) / (sqrt( (h +k +l)^2 - (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (1 - cos theta)^2 ) )

So, for (111):

Numerator: sqrt(3) ≈1.732.

Denominator: sqrt(9 -3*(1 -0.866)^2 )

Compute (1 -0.866)=0.134.

(1 -0.866)^2=0.017956.

Multiply by 3: 0.053868.

Subtract from 9: 9-0.053868≈8.9461.

sqrt(8.9461)=2.991.

So,

d=10 * 1.732 /2.991 ≈17.32 /2.991≈5.786 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute this differently. Let me try:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which would be 10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=3.49.

But I'm not getting anywhere. I think I'll have to give up and choose the option that's approximately a * sqrt(1/3), which is 10 *0.577=5.77, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstrom, but I'm not sure.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the given values
- \( h = k = l = 1 \)
- \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), so \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)

The denominator becomes:
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)
\]

Substituting:
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
\]
\[
2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) = 2(3 \cdot 0.866) = 5.196
\]

Thus:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196
\]

### Step 2: Analyzing the result
The denominator is negative, which suggests an issue with the formula or the interpretation of the angles. In a rhombohedral system, the angles are typically acute, but the formula may not account for certain distortions or conventions. To proceed, the absolute value of the denominator is assumed for the calculation:

\[
\text{Denominator (absolute value)} = 2.196
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( d_{hkl} \)
\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{\text{Denominator (absolute value)}}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2.196}} \approx \frac{10}{1.481} \approx 6.75 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with the options
The calculated value of \( 6.75 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9 Å. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the formula or additional factors not accounted for in the calculation. Given the options, the closest plausible answer based on the problem setup is:

**Answer: B**
