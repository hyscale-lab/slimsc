Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that their wavelengths of maximum brightness are the same. Then, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for black body radiation, the peak wavelength is related to the temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. So both stars have the same temperature. Then, the luminosity formula for a star (a black body) is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh right, because L is the power output, which is proportional to surface area (4πR²) times the flux per unit area (σT⁴).

So, the luminosity of each star would be proportional to R² times T⁴. Since T is the same for both, L is proportional to R².

Wait, but in this problem, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, L1 = (R1²/R2²) * L2. Because L is proportional to R², and T is the same.

So substituting R1 = 1.5 R2, we get L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait again. The question mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect anything? Oh, because when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength would change. But the question says that the wavelengths at which the
