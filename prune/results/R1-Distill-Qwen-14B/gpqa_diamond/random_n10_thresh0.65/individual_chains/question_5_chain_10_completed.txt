Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, okay, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, the operator P itself must be the sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector components.

Oh right, because the operator along an arbitrary direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P (which has components P_x, P_y, P_z) and the direction vector n. So, the operator P would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But in this case, the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane. So the y-component n_y must be zero. That simplifies things a bit. So, P becomes n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write down the given matrices:

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

P_y is (ħ/2) times:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

P_z is (ħ/2) times:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

Since n is in the x-z plane, n = (n_x, 0, n_z). And since it's a direction vector, it should be normalized, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me compute that. Substituting the matrices:

P = (n_x * (ħ/2)) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z * (ħ/2)) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding these together, the matrix will have elements:

Top-left: (n_z * ħ/2)
Top-right: (n_x * ħ/2)
Bottom-left: (n_x * ħ/2)
Bottom-right: (-n_z * ħ/2)

So the matrix form is:
[ [ (n_z ħ/2), (n_x ħ/2) ],
  [ (n_x ħ/2), (-n_z ħ/2) ] ]

Wait, but since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, I need to find the eigenvector for this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The general approach for finding eigenvectors is to solve (P - λ I) v = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So, let's set up the matrix equation (P - λ I). For λ = ħ/2, we have:

Each element of P is as above. So:

Top-left element: (n_z ħ/2) - (ħ/2) = (n_z - 1)(ħ/2)
Top-right: (n_x ħ/2)
Bottom-left: (n_x ħ/2)
Bottom-right: (-n_z ħ/2) - (ħ/2) = (-n_z -1)(ħ/2)

So the matrix becomes:
[ [ (n_z -1)(ħ/2), (n_x ħ/2) ],
  [ (n_x ħ/2), (-n_z -1)(ħ/2) ] ]

Since ħ/2 is a common factor, we can factor it out and focus on the matrix without the scalar:

[ [ (n_z -1), n_x ],
  [ n_x, (-n_z -1) ] ]

The eigenvector equation (P - λ I) v = 0 implies that for a non-trivial solution, the determinant of (P - λ I) must be zero. But since we're doing this for the eigenvalue, the equation [ (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0 ] and [ n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0 ] must hold.

Wait, actually, if I'm solving (P - λ I) v = 0, the equations are:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

These are two equations in variables v1 and v2.

Let me write the first equation:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0 → equation (1)

The second equation:

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0 → equation (2)

From equation (1), I can solve for v2 in terms of v1:

v2 = (1 - n_z) v1 / n_x

Wait, assuming n_x is not zero. If n_x is zero, then the direction is purely along z, but I don't think that's the case here because the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane. So, n_x can be non-zero.

Plugging this into equation (2):

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) [ (1 - n_z) v1 / n_x ] = 0

Multiply both sides by n_x to eliminate denominator:

n_x^2 v1 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) v1 = 0

Factor out v1:

v1 [n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z)] = 0

Since v1 cannot be zero (unless v2 is also zero, which gives trivial solution), the term in brackets must be zero.

So,

n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) )= 0

Expand the product:

(-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) = (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)
= -n_z + n_z² -1 + n_z
= ( -n_z + n_z ) + n_z² -1
= n_z² -1

So, the equation becomes:

n_x^2 + (n_z^2 -1) = 0 → n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1

Which makes sense because n is a unit vector. So, this condition holds, and the equations are consistent.

So, from equation (1), v2 = [(1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

v = [ v1, v2 ] = v1 [1, (1 - n_z)/n_x ]

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [1, (1 - n_z)/n_x ]

But wait, we can choose v1 to be any non-zero value. To make it normalized, we need to compute the normalization condition.

The normalization condition is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.

Since the eigenvector is in a two-dimensional space, let's compute the magnitude squared:

|v1|^2 [ 1^2 + ( (1 - n_z)/n_x )^2 ] = 1

Let me call the expression in the brackets as a constant:

C = 1 + [ (1 - n_z)^2 / n_x^2 ]

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, let's express everything in terms of n_z.

n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

So,

C = 1 + (1 - n_z)^2 / (1 - n_z^2 )

= 1 + [ (1 - n_z)^2 ] / [ (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) ]

= 1 + (1 - n_z) / (1 + n_z )

Simplify further:

= [ (1 + n_z ) + (1 - n_z ) ] / (1 + n_z )

= [ 2 ] / (1 + n_z )

So,

C = 2 / (1 + n_z )

Therefore, the normalization factor is sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) because:

v1^2 * [2/(1 + n_z)] =1 → v1^2 = (1 + n_z)/2 → v1 = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

So, the normalized eigenvector components are:

v1 = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )
v2 = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] * v1

But since n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z^2 ), because n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

Wait, so n_x is positive or negative? Well, the direction in x-z plane could be in any quadrant, but since the problem is about an arbitrary direction, perhaps we can assume n_x is positive. Or perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, let's express (1 - n_z)/n_x as:

(1 - n_z)/sqrt(1 - n_z^2 )

Which can be written as:

(1 - n_z) / sqrt( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) )

= sqrt( (1 - n_z) / (1 + n_z) )

Because:

(1 - n_z) / sqrt( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)^2 ) / sqrt( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) )
= sqrt( (1 - n_z) * (1 - n_z) ) / sqrt( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) )
= sqrt( (1 - n_z) ) * sqrt(1 - n_z) / sqrt( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) )
= sqrt( (1 - n_z) ) * sqrt( (1 - n_z) ) / sqrt( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) )
= sqrt( (1 - n_z) ) * sqrt( (1 - n_z)/(1 + n_z) ) )
Wait, maybe a better approach is to square it:

( (1 - n_z)/n_x )^2 = (1 - n_z)^2 / (1 - n_z^2 )

= (1 - n_z)^2 / ( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) )

= (1 - n_z)/(1 + n_z )

So, the square of v2 is (1 - n_z)/(1 + n_z) times v1 squared.

But for normalization, v1^2 + v2^2 =1. So, perhaps it's better to express v1 and v2 in terms of angles.

Wait, maybe we can parameterize the direction vector n. Since n is in the x-z plane, let's represent it in spherical coordinates. Let’s say the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = cosθ. But since n is in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, but perhaps arbitrary. Wait, no—since the problem says an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, which is the x-z plane, so φ can be any angle. Hmm, but perhaps the specific components can be expressed in terms of θ.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think about it.

Alternatively, let's consider that the direction n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So in 2D (x-z plane), θ is the polar angle.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

That's a good approach. So substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, the normalized eigenvector components v1 and v2 become:

v1 = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 )
v2 = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ * v1

But let's compute v2:

v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] * sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 )

Hmm. Let's compute [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] * sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 )

We can write (1 - cosθ) as 2 sin²(θ/2), and (1 + cosθ) as 2 cos²(θ/2).
Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

(1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2)
(1 + cosθ) = 2 cos²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Substituting these into the expression:

v2 = [ (2 sin²(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) ] * sqrt( (2 cos²(θ/2))/2 )

Simplify the fractions:

The numerator inside the square brackets is 2 sin²(θ/2), denominator is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So,

= [ (2 sin²(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) ] 
= [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ) ] 
= tan(θ/2 )

Now, the sqrt term:

sqrt( (2 cos²(θ/2))/2 ) = sqrt( cos²(θ/2) ) = |cos(θ/2)|. Assuming θ is between 0 and π, cos(θ/2) is positive, so it's just cos(θ/2).

So, v2 = tan(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) = sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ) * cos(θ/2) ) = sin(θ/2 )

So, v2 = sin(θ/2)

Wait, let me recheck that calculation.

Wait, v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] * sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 )

Expressed in terms of θ/2:

(1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2)
(1 + cosθ) = 2 cos²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So,

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = (2 sin²(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) 
= (sin²(θ/2)) / ( sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) )
= sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ) 
= tan(θ/2 )

And sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( cos²(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2 )

So, putting it together:

v2 = tan(θ/2) * cos(θ/2 ) 
= [ sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2) ) ] * cos(θ/2 )
= sin(θ/2 )

So, v2 = sin(θ/2 )

And v1 = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = cos(θ/2 )

Because:

(1 + cosθ) = 2 cos²(θ/2)
So sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( cos²(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2 )

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ]

Wait, but that would be the case if the problem were in a 2-level system with eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, and the eigenvector is in the direction n. So the components of the spinor would be cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), but maybe multiplied by some phase depending on the components of the operator.

Wait another point: The operator P is given in terms of P_x, P_y, P_z. These are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, the operator P along n is (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z ) * ħ/2.

The eigenstates of such an operator are spin-up and spin-down along n. The spin-up state in the direction n is given by the spinor:

[ cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ]

But in our case, the direction n lies in the x-z plane, so φ is either 0 or π, but the question doesn't specify the direction. Wait, no, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so φ can be any angle. But in our derivation, the eigenvector came out as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which doesn't have a phase factor. Hmm.

Wait, but looking at the operator P, which is made from P_x, P_y, and P_z. The P_y component has imaginary elements, which would introduce a phase factor in the spinor's second component.

Ah, right. So when the operator has P_y component, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor. But in our earlier derivation, we found the components without considering the phase, but perhaps because the direction is in x-z plane, the phase might be zero.

Wait, let's think. The direction vector is in the x-z plane, so φ is 0 or π. But the problem says it's an arbitrary direction, so perhaps φ can take any value, but in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π? Or is it any angle since x-z is a plane that's, say, φ=0 is x-axis, φ=π/2 is z-axis? Wait, no, the x-z plane is spanned by angles where φ is 0 and π, but in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane is actually φ = 0 and φ= π, but if I'm using the standard spherical coordinates where θ is the polar angle and φ the azimuthal, then the x-z plane (assuming it's the plane y=0) would have φ=0 and φ=π.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the spin states. The eigenvector for spin-up along a direction in the x-z plane would have a phase factor of e^{i φ} in the second component.

So, more generally, the spin-up state is:

[ cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ]

But in our problem, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so φ could be anything. However, looking back at the options, option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ ), but that's not in terms of θ/2. Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ), which matches our derivation without the phase. But option B has θ instead of θ/2.

Wait, our eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2 ), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ].

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

So, the correct normalized eigenvector would have components cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) multiplied by some phase, but in our case, perhaps the phase is zero if the direction is along x or z.

Wait, but the question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the answer must be a general expression, not specific to a particular direction.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches our result. Option B has theta instead of theta/2, so that's probably for a different scenario.

Wait, but why is there an option D, which has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). That seems more complicated. So when would that happen?

Hmm, perhaps I missed a normalization factor or something else.

Wait another thing: The eigenvector I have is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], but perhaps multiplied by some factor. Wait, no. Because in the 2x2 system, the spinor is already normalized when the components are cos and sin, assuming theta is measured correctly.

But wait, let me think again.

The eigenvector I derived is:

v1 = cos(θ/2)

v2 = e^{i φ} sin(θ/2 )

So, the components are cos(θ/2) and e^{iφ} sin(θ/2 ). So, in the options, which one matches that?

Looking at option B: (cosθ, e^{i phi} sin theta )

No, because it's theta, not theta/2.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Doesn’t include the phase factor, but perhaps the phase is zero because the problem says the direction is in the x-z plane, which is the same as the real axis in the spinor’s phase space. Wait, no, because the x-z plane could have any phi.

Hmm, but the eigenvector might include a phase. So perhaps none of the options directly match, but looking at the options again.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which is for theta and phi, but that seems more like the components might come from a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again about the operator.

The operator P is along n, which is in x-z plane. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we're looking for the eigenstate with spin up along n.

The eigenvector for spin-up along an arbitrary direction is given by the spinor:

|ψ> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>

Which in vector form is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

So, the components are cos(theta/2) and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2).

Looking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which is not the same as theta/2.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which misses the phase factor.

Wait, but option B has theta instead of theta/2, so it's not matching.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me look at the given options again.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

But in our case, the components are cos(theta/2) and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2). So none of the options directly match that.

Wait, looking again at the problem statement, the options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) h, sqrt(1/3) h )

No, that doesn't look right. The components are in terms of hbar, but probably not.

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

D) (sqrt(2/3) h cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) h sin(theta/2))

Wait, option D has sqrt(2/3) h and sqrt(1/3) h multiplied with cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So that's a normalized vector, but multiplied by some constants.

Wait, but why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization step. Let me re-examine the normalization.

Earlier, I found that the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But perhaps the problem is considering the muon’s spin-½ system in the direction n, but perhaps the muon's spin state is being considered more in terms of the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices. Alternatively, perhaps the given operator is not in the standard form.

Wait, the given operator P is in terms of P_x, P_y, P_z. Each component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So P = (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) * (ħ/2 )

So, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

So, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, the eigenstate is the spin-up state along n.

The spin-up state along a direction making an angle theta with the z-axis is:

|+n> = cos(theta/2)|↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|↓>

Which is the same as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

So, the components are cos(theta/2) and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2). So, among the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but without the phase factor. So, unless the phase is zero, perhaps because n is in x-z plane, but not necessarily. So unless the problem is assuming phi=0.

But the question says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi can be any value. Therefore, the correct expression must include the phase factor e^{i phi}.

Hmm, but none of the options have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a real vector, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have complex components.

Wait, the given options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) h, sqrt(1/3) h )

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

D) (sqrt(2/3) h cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) h sin(theta/2) )

So, the correct answer must be option C, but it's missing the phase factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the magnitude components, not considering the phase.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is not normalized in the way I thought. Let me recheck the normalization.

Wait, when I derived the components, I assumed that the direction vector is (sin theta, 0, cos theta), which is correct for the x-z plane (phi=0). So, in that case, phi=0, and the phase factor e^{i phi} becomes 1. So, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

In this case, when phi=0, the option C is correct.

But the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So phi can be any value, but perhaps the eigenvector's phase is determined by the components of the operator.

Wait, the given components for P include a complex term in P_y. So, the eigenvector may pick up a phase from that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not have assumed phi=0, and the eigenvector should have e^{i phi}.

Wait, let me think again. The direction in the x-z plane can be written as (sin theta cos phi, 0, cos theta ), but in that case, the spinor would have a phase e^{i phi}.

But in the problem statement, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so phi could be any value, but the eigenvector would have a phase of e^{i phi}.

But none of the options include e^{i phi}, except option B, but option B uses theta instead of theta/2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let me consider the general case where the direction is given by angles theta and phi.

The eigenvector for spin-up along (theta, phi) is:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But the problem says the direction is in the x-z plane, which is phi=0 or phi=pi? Wait, no. The x-z plane is the plane where y=0, so in spherical coordinates, that corresponds to phi=0 and phi=pi, but that would be along the positive and negative x-axis. Alternatively, perhaps the x-z plane includes any phi where the projection onto the y-axis is zero, which is all directions with phi=0 and phi=pi.

Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinate system.

Wait, the standard spherical coordinates have phi as the angle in the xy-plane from the x-axis. So, the x-z plane would correspond to phi=0 and phi=pi, which are along the x-axis and opposite x-axis, respectively.

But the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which is more general. Hmm, so maybe my earlier approach was wrong because I considered theta as the polar angle, but perhaps the direction is in the x-z plane, which would have phi=0 or pi.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose the direction is along the x-axis, so theta = 90 degrees (pi/2 radians), phi=0. Then the eigenvector should be [0,1], because the spin-up along x is (|0> + |1> ) / sqrt(2), which is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ].

Wait, no, the eigenstates for Pauli matrices are different. For sigma_x, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. The eigenstate for +1 is (1,1)/sqrt(2). Similarly, for sigma_z, the eigenstate for +1 is (1,0).

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me get back.

In the x-z plane, any direction can be written as a combination of x and z. So, the eigenvector should be a combination of the eigenstates of P_x and P_z.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the operator P. Let me construct the operator matrix.

Earlier, I found that the operator matrix is:

[ [ (n_z ħ/2), (n_x ħ/2) ],
  [ (n_x ħ/2), (-n_z ħ/2) ] ]

We need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is:

[ [ (n_z ħ/2 - ħ/2 ), (n_x ħ/2) ],
  [ (n_x ħ/2 ), (-n_z ħ/2 - ħ/2 ) ] ] [v1; v2] = 0

Divide each element by ħ/2:

[ [ (n_z -1 ), n_x ],
  [n_x, (-n_z -1 ) ] ] [v1; v2] = 0

So, the equations are:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0 → equation (1)
n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0 → equation (2)

From equation (1): v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1

Substitute into equation (2):

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) [ (1 - n_z)/n_x v1 ] = 0

Multiply through by n_x:

n_x² v1 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z ) v1 = 0

As before, this simplifies to n_x² + (n_z² -1 ) = 0 → since n_x² + n_z² =1, this holds.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [1, (1 - n_z)/n_x ]

As earlier, to normalize, we have:

|v1|² + |v2|² =1 → |v1|² [1 + ( (1-n_z)^2 ) / n_x² ] =1

Which becomes:

v1² [ (n_x² + (1 -n_z)^2 ) / n_x² ] =1

But since n_x² =1 -n_z², let's substitute:

v1² [ (1 -n_z² + (1 -n_z)^2 ) ) / (1 -n_z²) ] =1

Compute numerator:

1 -n_z² + (1 - 2n_z +n_z² ) = 1 -n_z² +1 -2n_z +n_z² = 2 -2n_z

So,

v1² [ (2 - 2n_z ) / (1 -n_z²) ) ] =1

Factor numerator and denominator:

(2(1 -n_z)) / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] = 2/(1 +n_z )

So,

v1² * [2/(1 +n_z ) ] =1 → v1 = sqrt( (1 +n_z ) / 2 )

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

v1 = sqrt( (1 +n_z ) / 2 )

v2 = (1 -n_z )/(n_x ) * v1 

But n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z² ) → let's factor that.

(1 -n_z ) / sqrt( (1 -n_z )(1 +n_z ) ) ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / (1 +n_z ) )

So, v2 = v1 * sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / (1 +n_z ) )

Thus, the components are:

v1 = sqrt( (1 +n_z ) / 2 )

v2 = sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / 2 )

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

Which can be written as [ sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

But n_z is cos(theta) if theta is the polar angle. So, n_z = cos(theta).

So, substituting:

v1 = sqrt( (1 + cos(theta) ) / 2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

v2 = sqrt( (1 - cos(theta) ) / 2 ) = sin(theta/2 )

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But wait, in the problem statement, the operator includes P_y which is imaginary. So, perhaps the eigenvector could have a complex component, but in this case, since the direction is in x-z plane, perhaps the phase is real.

Wait, no, the eigenvalues equation would have real and imaginary parts. But in our case, the eigenvector comes out real because the components of the operator P in x and z are real, and the direction is in x-z plane.

Wait, no. Because the P_y component is imaginary. So, the operator P has both real and imaginary parts. Thus, the eigenvector could have complex components, but in our case, the direction is in x-z plane, where perhaps the phase is zero.

Hmm, but when I did the calculation, the eigenvector came out as a real vector. So, the components are real and the phase is zero.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Looking again at the options, option C is exactly this.

So, the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are $\hbar/2$ times their respective matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
The operator $\vec{P}$ becomes:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]
where $n_z = \cos\theta$ and $n_x = \sin\theta$.

### Step 2: Solve for the eigenvector
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Substituting $\vec{P}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}
\]
This simplifies to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
\sin\theta v_1 + (-\cos\theta - 1)v_2 = 0 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

From equation (1):
\[
v_2 = \frac{(1 - \cos\theta)}{\sin\theta} v_1
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
Substituting $v_2$ into the normalization condition $|v_1|^2 + |v_2|^2 = 1$:
\[
|v_1|^2 + \left|\frac{(1 - \cos\theta)}{\sin\theta} v_1\right|^2 = 1
\]
\[
|v_1|^2 \left[ 1 + \frac{(1 - \cos\theta)^2}{\sin^2\theta} \right] = 1
\]
Using $\sin^2\theta = 1 - \cos^2\theta$:
\[
|v_1|^2 \left[ 1 + \frac{(1 - \cos\theta)^2}{1 - \cos^2\theta} \right] = 1
\]
\[
|v_1|^2 \left[ 1 + \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{1 + \cos\theta} \right] = 1
\]
\[
|v_1|^2 \left[ \frac{2}{1 + \cos\theta} \right] = 1
\]
\[
|v_1|^2 = \frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}
\]
\[
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}}
\]
Similarly:
\[
v_2 = \frac{(1 - \cos\theta)}{\sin\theta} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}}
\]
Using $\sin\theta = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2\theta}$:
\[
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}}
\]

### Step 4: Final eigenvector components
The normalized eigenvector is:
\[
v = \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}} \end{bmatrix}
\]
Using the trigonometric identities $\cos\theta = 2\cos^2(\theta/2) - 1$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:
\[
v = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — Incorrect, as it does not depend on $\theta$ or $\phi$.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ — Incorrect, as it uses $\theta$ instead of $\theta/2$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — Correct, matches the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — Incorrect, introduces unnecessary normalization factors.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
