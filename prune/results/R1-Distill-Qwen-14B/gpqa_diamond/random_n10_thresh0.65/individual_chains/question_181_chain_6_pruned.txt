Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think through this.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III process stopped, the change in neutrino flux would be felt here on Earth after that delay.

The question is asking about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the pp-III branch contributes to these energy ranges.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces two positrons and two neutrinos, but I think pp-III is a higher energy part of the chain. Oh right, the pp-III reactions involve higher energy levels, which emit higher energy neutrinos.

In the Sun's core, the dominant neutrino production is from the pp-I branch, which produces lower energy neutrinos. But the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the flux of higher energy neutrinos arriving on Earth would drop.

But wait, neutrinos are produced in various processes. The main ones are the proton-proton chain (pp), the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle, and others. The CNO
