Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric because it involves dx and dy. I remember that in 2D, the area element is usually found using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. But wait, when the metric is diagonal, like here, the determinant would be the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy², right? Since both are multiplied by the same factor here, the determinant should be [32 / (4 - x² - y²)]².

So the area element dA would be sqrt(determinant) dx dy. Let me calculate that. The determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))², so the square root would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but this looks familiar. The denominator 4 - x² - y² suggests that this is a surface of constant curvature. Or maybe a hyperbolic space? Because I remember that the metric for a 2D hyperbolic space can be written as something like (dx² + dy²)/(a²(1 - x² - y²)) if it's a pseudosphere. Or wait, maybe it's (dx² + dy²)/(1 - x² - y²) for a unit pseudosphere.
