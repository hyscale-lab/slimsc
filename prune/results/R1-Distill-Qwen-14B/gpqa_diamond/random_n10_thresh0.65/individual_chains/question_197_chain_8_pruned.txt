Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra, so I should analyze those first to determine the structure of Compound X.

Let's look at the IR data: peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either an O-H stretch (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or an N-H stretch, but since there's no mention of amines, I'll focus on O-H. The peak around 1720 cm-1 is strong and suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has a benzene ring with substituents.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton. Alternatively, it could be an O-H from a carboxylic acid, but the integration is 1H, which is more consistent with an aldehyde because carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm as well, but often with more splitting. Wait, but wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1 which could be a ketone or aldehyde. Aldehydes have strong absorption near 1720. So maybe it's an aldehyde.

But wait, if the IR had a peak around 3400, that's also a region for O-H, but if it's an aldehyde, maybe that's an acidic alpha proton? Or perhaps there's another O-H group. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents and another functional group.

Alternatively, the 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid O-H. But then the aldehyde IR would be at a higher wavenumber, but the given IR doesn't go higher than 1720. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H around 250
