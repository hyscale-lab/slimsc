Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think about each part step by step.

The first part is reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a saponified ester, right? And the other compound has an alpha-beta unsaturated ester group. So the Michael donor is the dimethyl malonate, and the Michael acceptor is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

In a typical Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me visualize the structure of the acrylate. It's methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the CH2. Wait, no, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so maybe it's CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 with the CH2 attached to the p-tolyl group. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but the substituent is on the alpha carbon. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure: the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on C3? Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but the substituent is on the CH2. Wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group in the 3-position. I think I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group attached to the CH2. So, something like CH2(p-tolyl)-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, which is the CH2 next to the carbonyl. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the CH2. So, perhaps it's CH2(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3. Oh wait, since it's (E) configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond would be opposite.

So when the Michael addition happens, the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is a strong nucleophile) would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. Its enolate would be the conjugate base, where the alpha carbon (the CH2) is deprotonated, making it a good nucleophile.

So the enolate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate, which is the CH2 with the p-tolyl group. Wait, no, the acrylate's structure is CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-R? Or perhaps I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=
