Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

So the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after diluting the acetic acid. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution. The formula I remember is M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial volume is 20 cm³ and the new volume is 40 cm³ because we add 20 cm³ of water. 

Let me compute the diluted concentration. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. That's (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) should produce the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized to acetate. So the pH at equivalence will depend on the concentration of the acetate solution. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), the solution will be basic. To find pH, I can use the Kb formula. 

Wait, let me think. The initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M. The volume is 40 cm³. So the moles of acetic acid are Molarity * Volume in liters. 

Molarity = 0.025 M, Volume = 0.04 L. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. 

So the total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³. The concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) will be moles / volume. Moles of acetate = same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Volume is 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, for the acetate ion, since it's a weak base, I can use Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. That's a very small Kb, so maybe the solution is slightly basic, but not strongly.

Wait, but acetate is CH3COO^- in solution, which reacts with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb is small, so the hydroxide concentration would be low. 

But maybe using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is better here. Wait no, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is a solution of a weak base (acetate). So we can calculate pH using the Kb expression.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So, for acetate, the pH can be found by:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). But wait, at equivalence, all HA is converted to A^-, so [HA] is zero? No, wait, in this case, the solution is just A^- in water. So it's not a buffer anymore. So I think I need to approach it differently.

So, for a solution of a weak base (like acet
