Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully again.

The problem says: There's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and gives four options to choose from.

Hmm, right. So I'm thinking about what kind of energy we're dealing with here. Since we're talking about charges and their interactions, this must be an electrostatics problem involving electric potential energy.

Wait, so the system has charges, and the energy would be the potential energy between them. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge. But also, the 12 charges are at a distance of 2 meters from P, but what about their distances from each other? Do they form some sort of structure?

Wait, the problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 m away from P. But their positions relative to each other might be such that they're equally spaced around P, perhaps forming a regular structure. Since they're identical and constrained, maybe they form a regular dodecahedron or something? Or maybe they're all on a sphere, equally spaced.

But wait, for the purpose of calculating the potential energy, I think that the mutual interactions between the 12 charges themselves might contribute to the total potential energy, as well as their interactions with the fixed charge at P.

So the total potential energy U of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy. Hmm. So perhaps the system can arrange these 12 charges in a way that minimizes the potential energy. But wait, each charge is constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So the 12 charges are fixed on a sphere of radius 2 m around P. So their mutual distances can vary, but all are on that sphere.

Wait, but arranging 12 identical charges
