Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. There are four steps involved, each transforming one compound into another. I'll break down each step and try to figure out what's happening.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

There are also some hints provided:

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b: The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, each a different cyclic ketone.

Alright, let's start by analyzing the reaction steps and the hints.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.
HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So, if A reacts with HCN, it likely has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde). Adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Wait, but when a ketone reacts with HCN, it adds across the carbonyl, giving a cyanohydrin. So, A is a ketone, B is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Wait, no. Wait, HCN adds to a carbonyl group. So, if A is a ketone, B would be the corresponding cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol with a CN group attached. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, then B would be a primary cyanohydrin. But since the product is an alcohol, perhaps A is a ketone.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. H2 and Pd are conditions for hydrogenation. So, what gets reduced here? If B is a nitrile, it would be reduced to an amine. But wait, B came from A + H
