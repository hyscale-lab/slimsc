Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.

The question is about the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. The options are given as factors, so it's asking by what factor is Star_1's luminosity greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. Since they're black bodies, that should apply here.

Wait, but other factors come into play here. The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest (the peak wavelengths) are the same. Oh, right, that's Wien's law. Wien's displacement law says that λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T were different, λ_max would change.

So both stars have the same temperature T. That's an important point. That simplifies things because their temperatures are equal.

Now, the luminosity of each star depends on their radius and temperature. Since T is the same for both, L is proportional to R². Because L = 4πR²σT⁴, so T is same, so L is proportional to R².

Wait, but wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, right, that might affect the observed temperature due to the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its spectrum shifts—blue shift or red shift.

Radial velocity is given: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. So Star_1 is not moving relative to us, but Star_2 is moving away (since the radial velocity is positive, assuming it's moving away, but I should check the sign conventions).

Wait, wait. The radial velocity is often given as positive when moving
