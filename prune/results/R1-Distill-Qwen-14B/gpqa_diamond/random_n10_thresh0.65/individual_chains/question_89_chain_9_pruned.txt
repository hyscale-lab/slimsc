Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and it goes through several steps, each producing a new product. Then, they're asking about the NMR spectrum of the final product after ozonolysis and some workup. Hmm, I remember that ozonolysis tends to break double bonds, so let's see.

First, the initial reaction: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I recall that when vicinal dihalides (where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation. This should form an alkene. So, the product 1 should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond. The structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane molecule with Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3. When KOH is used, the two Brs will leave, but wait, no, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3? Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 or 2 and 3? Hmm, I need to think about the structure.

Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so carbons 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Wait, no—if it's 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the two Brs are on opposite sides of the adamantane structure. So when KOH is used, each Br will be eliminated, but in this case, since the dihalide is vicinal? Wait, wait, no. 1,3-dibromo means the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So for elimination to form a double bond, the Brs must be on adjacent carbons. Wait, that's not the case here. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide but a dihalide on carbons that are two apart. So elimination would require adjacent Brs. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the structure.

Wait, no, wait. The initial product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a peak
