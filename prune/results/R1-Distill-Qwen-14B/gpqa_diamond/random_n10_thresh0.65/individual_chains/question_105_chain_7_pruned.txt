Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me start by reading it carefully.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. The scenario is that these spots cause brightness variations as the star rotates, which could mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots.

Wait, the question is asking what would be the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the host star. So, Rpl/Rstar.

I remember that the dip in brightness when a planet transits a star is calculated using the formula for the area blocked. The area blocked is the area of the planet's disk divided by the star's area. So the fractional dip, delta F, is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But in this case, the star has spots that are causing the brightness variations. So I need to calculate how much the spots affect the total brightness and compare that to the dip caused by a planet.

The star's hemisphere is covered 20% in spots. So filling factor is 20% per hemisphere, right? So the total area covered by spots on the star is 0.2 (for one hemisphere) of the star's surface.

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So each hemisphere (northern and southern, presumably) has 20% of its area covered by spots. So total spots cover 0.2 (northern) + 0.2 (southern) = 0.4 of the star's surface? No, no. Because the star's surface is 4πR², and each hemisphere is 2πR². So the filling factor is 20% per hemisphere. So for one hemisphere, it's 0.2 * 2πR². But wait, the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. So maybe it's only the northern or southern hemisphere that is covered, not both. Wait, the question says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So only one hemisphere (like, say, the northern half) has 20% coverage. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2πR²/2) = 0.2 * π R². So the total area is 0.2 π R².

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the spots cover 0.2 * π R², which is 0.05 of the star's surface (since 0.2 * π R² / 4π R² = 0.05). So 5% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

But wait, the star emits light based on its temperature. The spots are cooler. So when a spot is in view, it contributes less to the total brightness than a normal part.

Wait, the flux (as observed) is the sum of the flux from all the visible parts of the star. When the star rotates, different spots come into view. But the question says that the brightness variation is due to rotational modulation, which is similar to a planet
