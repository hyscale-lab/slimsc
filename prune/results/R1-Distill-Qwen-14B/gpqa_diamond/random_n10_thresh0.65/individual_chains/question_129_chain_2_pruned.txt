Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound E is formed in the reaction scheme. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with Compound A reacting with HCN to form Compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to give C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and finally, D eliminates an inert gas to produce E. There are also some hints provided, so I should pay attention to those.

First, let me think about each reaction step.

1. Compound A + HCN → Compound B.
I remember that when aldehydes or ketones react with HCN, they form cyanohydrins. So, the reaction is probably adding a cyanide group to a carbonyl compound. So, A is likely a carbonyl compound, maybe an aldehyde or ketone.

2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. H2 and Pd are typically used for hydrogenation. So, if B is a cyanohydrin (which has a C≡N group), reducing it would probably turn the nitrile group into an amine. Wait, but wait—when you reduce a nitrile (R-C≡N) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, you usually get a primary amine (R-CH2-NH2). Alternatively, another possibility is that if B is a nitrile attached to a ring, reducing it would create a CH2NH2 group. But wait, the product after reduction would be an amine. So, Compound C would have an amine group, maybe.

3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D. HNO2 is nitrous acid, which is commonly used in the production of diazonium salts from amines, especially primary aromatic amines. However, if the amine is not aromatic, perhaps it's a secondary or primary aliphatic amine. Wait, but I think for aliphatic amines, nitrous acid can lead to different reactions. For example, in the case of a secondary amine, HNO2 can cause elimination, forming an imine or something else. Alternatively, if the amine is primary, it could form a diazonium salt, which might undergo elimination, especially under certain conditions.

Wait, but considering the next step, which is elimination of an inert gas to form E. If D is
