Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small spherical cavity inside it. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So, the cavity is entirely within the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are four different expressions for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges inside them, the concept of electrostatic shielding comes into play. Wait, but wait—does that apply here? Wait, shielding applies when the conductor is a shell. Wait, in this case, the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity. So, if the conductor were a solid sphere, any charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner surface, right?

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we place a charge +q in the cavity, it will induce a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, no—the conductor was initially neutral
