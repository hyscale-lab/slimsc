Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So, we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The key here is to determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should prioritize observing that one.

Let me list the given information:

1. Both planets have the same mass.
2. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, P1 = P2 / 3.
3. Both have circular orbits.
4. The host stars have the same radii, but the host of Planet_1 (Star 1) has twice the mass of Planet_2's host (Star 2). So, M1 = 2 * M2.
5. Stars have the same radius, R1 = R2.

Wait, but how does the star's mass affect the planet's probability of transiting? Oh right, the probability of a transit depends on the orbital distance and the star's radius. A planet transiting in front of its star from our perspective means the orbital plane must be aligned with our line of sight. The probability (P) of a transit is given by the formula:

P = (R_star) / (a * (1 + (m_planet/m_star)^(1/3))) 

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing formulas. Let me recall. Oh right, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet/M_star)^{1/3} )) ), but wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Wait, I think the main factors are the size of the star, the size of the planet, and the distance of the planet from the star.

Wait, no, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to be edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability depends on the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. The formula I remember is:

P = (R_star / a) * ( (R_planet + R_star) / R_star )^2 ) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe that's not right.

Wait, another approach. For a given star, the probability that a randomly oriented orbit
