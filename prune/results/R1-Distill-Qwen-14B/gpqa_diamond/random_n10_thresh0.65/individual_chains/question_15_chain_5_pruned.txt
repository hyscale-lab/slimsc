Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, given the information provided. Let me start by recalling what factors affect the transit probability.

I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula I vaguely remember is something like the probability being proportional to (Rp / R*)^2, but wait, that might not be exactly right. Oh wait, no, the formula is actually the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star's disk. So the probability is (Rp / R*)^2. But wait, no, wait. Another thought: the probability isn't just based on the size; it also depends on the orbital distance. Because for a planet to transit, its orbit needs to be aligned edge-on relative to us. So the probability is higher if the planet's orbital plane is more likely to be aligned with our line of sight.

Wait, but in reality, the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis (orbital distance from the star). Hmm, no, wait. Or maybe it's (R_p + R_*) / a, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the planetâ€™s orbital plane's area that is in our line of sight. But I think it's more about the geometry of the system.

Wait, I think the transit probability is actually (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (1/a), but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the formula more carefully. Oh wait, another approach
