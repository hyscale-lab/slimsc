Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

I remember that stability constants, also known as formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So, for each complex, β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think dithiocyanato would mean the complex has two SCN- ligands. So which β corresponds to that? Let's see: β1 is the first, which is likely the monodentate complex, so β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+ maybe. Then β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+? Wait, no, maybe each β is for a different charge. Wait, actually, the complexes could be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^(?), etc. Hmm, perhaps each β corresponds to the nth complex, like β1 is for the first complex, β2 the second, and so on. So if the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^+, [Co(SCN)₃]^2+, [Co(SCN)₄]^2+? Or perhaps it's different. I'm a bit confused on that.

Wait, stability constants are usually given for each step. So, β1 is the constant for the first complex formation: Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+, β2 would be for the second ligand: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, etc. So the overall β for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, no, I think each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would have a stability constant βn. So for n=1, [CoSCN]^+ with β1=
