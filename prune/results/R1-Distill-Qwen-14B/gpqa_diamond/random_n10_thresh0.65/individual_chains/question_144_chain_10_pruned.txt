Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me think through it. Alright, the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like distance = c * τ * β, where β is the velocity relative to the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and τ is the mean lifetime.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the equation τ = ħ / Γ. Since ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I should make sure about the units here. Because Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit, and ħ has units of GeV·s (if I'm not mistaken). So I'll need to handle the units carefully.

Let me jot down the knowns:

E_X = 8 GeV (production energy)
m_X = 1.2 GeV (mass)
Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV (width)

I think the first step is to calculate the velocity β. But wait, how does production energy relate to velocity? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of relativistic dynamics. The production energy would be the
