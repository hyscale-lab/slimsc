Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it provides to a nucleus. Hmm, the question is what energy the RHIC should have so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe because it has 3 neutrons. Because lithium normally has 3 protons, so 3 neutrons would make it Li-6.

So, first, I think I need to find the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. The energy in particle physics is usually the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, wait, wait. The question asks for the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in colliders, the energy is the kinetic energy given to each ion. Or is it the total energy?

Hmm, maybe I should clarify. When they say the energy of the collider, it's usually the kinetic energy each particle has. Or is it the total energy (gamma * m c²)? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. In accelerators, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. But sometimes, people might refer to the total energy. So I need to figure that out.

Wait, the question says: "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the speed is given, and I need to find the energy the collider imparts. So I think it's the total energy, because the speed is a relativistic term. Because gamma depends on the speed.

So first, I need to find the relativistic gamma factor for v = 0.96c.

Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. So v is 0.96c. Plugging in, v squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Take the square root: sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, better compute it more accurately. Let me calculate sqrt(0.0784). So 0.0784 is 7.84e-2. The square root of that is 0.28, yes, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need to find the total energy E = gamma * m c². So I need the rest mass of the nucleus X, which is Li-6. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately... I think the atomic mass is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Each u is about 1.660539e-27 kg. So 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 9.963234e-27 kg.

Wait, but I should check. Let me think: the exact mass of lithium-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. Wait, because each proton is about 1.007 u, and neutrons are about 1.0087 u. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(1.007) + 3*(1.0087) = 3*(2.0157) )= 6.0471 u. Hmm, but wait, wait, the exact mass is slightly less because of binding energy. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. But since I can't do that right now, perhaps I can approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass as 6 u. But let me proceed.

Assuming m = 6 u = 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg = 9.963234e-27 kg.

So E = gamma * m c².

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So c squared is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So E = 3.5714 * 9.963234e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s².

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, m*c²: 9.963234e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 9.963234e-27 * 9e16 = 89.669106e-11 J. Because 9e16 * 1e-27 is 9e-11, multiplied by 9.963234 gives 89.669106e-11 J.

Wait, let me compute that again. 9.963234e-27 * 9e16 = (9.963234 * 9) * (1e-27 * 1e16) )= 89.669106 * 1e-11 = 8.9669106e-10 J.

Wait, no. 1e-27 * 1e16 is 1e-11. So 9.963234e-27 * 9e16 = (9.963234 * 9) * 1e-11. 9.963234*9 is approximately 89.6691, so 89.6691e-11 J, which is 8.96691e-10 J.

Then, multiply by gamma (3.5714) to get E.

So 8.96691e-10 J * 3.5714 ≈ ?

3.5714 * 8.96691e-10 ≈ let me compute that.

3 * 8.96691e-10 is 26.90073e-10.

0.5714 * 8.96691e-10: Let's compute 0.5 * 8.96691e-10 = 4.483455e-10. 0.0714 * 8.96691e-10 ≈ ~ 0.0714*8.96691e-10 ≈ 6.4023e-11. So total is 4.483455e-10 + 6.4023e-11 = 4.483455e-10 + 0.064023e-9 = 5.12368e-10.

So 3.5714 * 8.96691e-10 ≈ 26.90073e-10 + 5.12368e-10 ≈ 32.02441e-10 J. Which is 3.202441e-9 J.

Wait, that's the energy in joules. But the options are in GeV. So I need to convert joules to GeV.

1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, which is 1.60218e-10 J.

So E in GeV is E (J) / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV).

So 3.202441e-9 J / 1.60218e-10 J/GeV ≈ (3.202441e-9) / (1.60218e-10) ) ≈ 20.00 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419, option B is 23.069. So 20 GeV is near option C.

Wait a second, but wait. Did I get the correct value for gamma? Let me recheck.

v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)).

v^2 = (0.96 c)^2 = 0.9216 c^2.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784, correct. So gamma is 3.5714.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1/sqrt(0.0784) precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator. Let's calculate sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784, yes. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857... approximately 3.57143.

So going back, m is 6 u. Let me compute 6 u in kg again.

1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So 6 u = 6 * 1.6605390666e-27 = 9.9632344e-27 kg.

Then, E = gamma * m c².

m c² in joules is 9.9632344e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 = 9.9632344e-27 * 9e16 = 89.6691096e-11 J.

Wait, 9e16 * 9.963e-27 = 9e16 * 9.963e-27 = (9 * 9.963) * 1e(16-27) )= 89.667 * 1e-11 = 8.9667e-10 J.

Wait, no: 9e16 is 9 * 1e16, 9.963e-27 is 9.963 * 1e-27.

Multiply them: 9 * 9.963 = 89.667, and 1e16 * 1e-27 = 1e-11. So 89.667e-11 = 8.9667e-10 J.

Then, E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 8.9667e-10 J.

Compute 3.5714 * 8.9667e-10.

Let me compute this with more precise numbers.

3.5714 * 8.9667 = ?

Let me compute 3 * 8.9667 = 26.9001.

0.5714 * 8.9667: 0.5 * 8.9667 =4.48335, 0.0714 *8.9667 ≈ 0.6402.

So 4.48335 + 0.6402 ≈5.1235.

So total is 26.9001 +5.1235=32.0236.

So 3.5714 *8.9667e-10=32.0236e-10 J =3.20236e-9 J.

Now, convert to GeV.

1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J.

So E = 3.20236e-9 J / 1.60218e-10 J/GeV.

Compute that:

3.20236e-9 / 1.60218e-10 = (3.20236 / 1.60218 ) * (1e-9 / 1e-10) )

3.20236 /1.60218 ≈ 2. So 3.20236 /1.60218 ≈ 2.0 (exactly, 3.20236 /1.60218 is 2, because 1.60218 *2=3.20436. Hmm, wait, but 3.20236 is a little less, so 2.0 is approximately 1.998.

Wait, because 1.60218 * 2 =3.20436, which is more than 3.20236, so perhaps the ratio is 1.998.

Wait, perhaps let me compute it accurately.

3.20236 divided by 1.60218.

1.60218 * 2 = 3.20436.

3.20236 is 3.20436 minus 0.002.

So 3.20236 = 1.60218 * (2 - delta), where delta is small.

Approximately, delta = (0.002)/1.60218 ≈ 0.001248.

So 2 - 0.001248 =1.99875.

So 3.20236 /1.60218 ≈ 1.99875.

So 1.99875 multiplied by 10 (because 1e-9 /1e-10 is 10) gives 19.9875 GeV.

So approximately 19.9875 GeV. But wait, the options have 20.132 GeV as option C.

Wait, but why is my calculation giving about 19.9875 GeV? That's very close to 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps my approximations are causing this. Maybe I should use more precise numbers.

Let me recompute with more precise values.

First, let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

(0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 *0.28=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.571428571...

So 3.571428571.

Next, the mass of lithium-6.

Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Wait, but the exact mass is not exactly 6 u. Let me get the more precise mass.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015122 u. Because I remember that the exact atomic masses are like that. So to be precise, m = 6.015122 u.

So m = 6.015122 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u.

Compute 6.015122 * 1.6605390666e-27.

6 * 1.660539e-27 is 9.963234e-27.

0.015122 *1.660539e-27 = let's compute 0.01 * 1.660539e-27 =1.660539e-29.

0.005122 *1.660539e-27 = 0.005 *1.660539e-27 =8.302695e-29, plus 0.000122 *1.660539e-27 = 2.0226e-29.

So 0.005122 *1.660539e-27 ≈ 8.302695e-29 + 2.0226e-29 = 10.3253e-29.

So 0.015122 *1.660539e-27 =1.660539e-29 +10.3253e-29= 11.9858e-29 kg.

So total m = 9.963234e-27 + 1.19858e-28 kg.

Wait, wait, no, 0.015122 is 1.5122e-2, so 6.015122 u is 6.015122 * 1.660539e-27 = 6 * 1.660539e-27 + 0.015122 *1.660539e-27.

Wait, 6 * 1.660539e-27 is 9.963234e-27.

0.015122 *1.660539e-27 = 0.015122 *1.660539 = ?

Compute 0.01 *1.660539 =0.01660539.

0.005122 *1.660539 = approx 0.008485.

So total is 0.01660539 +0.008485 = 0.02509039.

Multiply by 1e-27 kg: 2.509039e-29 kg.

So m = 9.963234e-27 + 2.509039e-29 = 9.963234e-27 + 0.02509039e-27 = 9.98832439e-27 kg.

So m c² is 9.98832439e-27 * (3e8)^2.

(3e8)^2 is 9e16 m²/s².

So m c² =9.98832439e-27 *9e16 = 89.89491951e-11 J.

Wait, 9.98832439e-27 *9e16 = 89.89491951e-11 J.

Which is 8.989491951e-10 J.

Now, multiply by gamma (3.571428571):

E =3.571428571 *8.989491951e-10 J.

Compute 3.571428571 *8.989491951e-10.

Let me compute 3.571428571 *8.989491951.

3 *8.989491951=26.968475853.

0.571428571 *8.989491951.

Compute 0.5 *8.989491951 =4.4947459755.

0.071428571 *8.989491951 = approximately 0.64053.

So total for 0.571428571 is 4.4947459755 +0.64053 =5.1352759755.

So total E in J is (26.968475853 +5.1352759755 )e-10 J.

Which is 32.1037518285e-10 J =3.21037518285e-9 J.

Convert to GeV: 3.21037518285e-9 J / (1.602176634e-10 J/GeV) = ?

3.21037518285e-9 / 1.602176634e-10 = (3.21037518285 /1.602176634)*10.

3.21037518285 /1.602176634 ≈ 2.0038.

Multiply by 10: 20.038 GeV.

So approximately 20.038 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but not exact. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in any step?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with gamma.

Wait, (0.96)^2 is 0.9216, correct. 1 -0.9216=0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.571428571.

But perhaps the error arises from the mass of the nucleus. I used m=6.015122 u. Let me check that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is 6 u, which would give E= (3.5714 *6 u c² )/ (1.6605e-27 kg per u) * etc.

Wait, no, because I already used 6.015122 u. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using exact expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula E = gamma * m c², and m is the rest mass.

Wait, another approach: the total energy is gamma * m c². The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². But the question is about the energy of the collider, which is usually the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, the question says: "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

In particle physics, the energy of the collider is typically the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. For example, the LHC's energy is given as the total energy (each proton has E = gamma m c²). But sometimes, people refer to the kinetic energy.

Wait, but the problem's options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy. Let me think.

If E is the kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c².

Earlier, I calculated the total energy as about 20.038 GeV.

If E is the kinetic energy, then it's gamma m c² - m c².

Gamma is 3.5714, so (3.5714 -1) =2.5714. So E_kinetic =2.5714 * m c².

Earlier, m c² in GeV is (m c² in J) / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV).

Wait, m c² is 6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, that's another approach. 1 u is about 931.5 MeV /c².

So m c² =6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV = ?

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015122 *931.5 MeV = approximately 14.07 MeV.

So m c² ≈5603.07 MeV ≈5.60307 GeV.

So E_total =gamma * m c² =3.5714 *5.60307 GeV.

3.5714 *5.60307 = let's compute.

3 *5.60307=16.80921.

0.5714 *5.60307≈3.199.

Total is about 19.008 GeV.

Wait, but earlier calculation via J gave about 20 GeV. Wait, this can't be. Oh wait, wait, but perhaps the 931.5 MeV/u is the rest mass energy, so m c² is 6.015122 u *931.5 MeV/u = 6.015122 *931.5.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.015122 *931.5= approx 14.1 MeV.

Total is 5603.1 MeV =5.6031 GeV.

So, E_total =3.5714 *5.6031 GeV ≈ 3.5714 *5.6031 ≈ 20.03 GeV.

Which aligns with the previous J-based calculation. So that's about 20.03 GeV.

So E_total is approximately 20.03 GeV. But the question is about the energy of the RHIC. If the RHIC's energy is the kinetic energy, it would be E = (gamma -1) m c².

So 3.5714 -1 =2.5714. 2.5714 *5.6031 GeV ≈ 14.41 GeV.

But that's not among the options. The options are around 20 GeV. So perhaps the question refers to the total energy.

Wait, the first calculation using exact numbers gave me about 20.03 GeV, which is close to option C, 20.132 GeV. But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute gamma * m c².

gamma =3.57142857...

m c² =6.015122 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.015122 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.015122 *931.5= let's compute.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005122 *931.5= (0.005 *931.5)=4.6575, and 0.000122 *931.5= approx 0.1135.

So 4.6575 +0.1135=4.771.

So 0.005122 *931.5= 4.771.

So total 0.015122 *931.5=9.315 +4.771=14.086.

So m c²=5589 +14.086=5603.086 MeV=5.603086 GeV.

So E_total =gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.603086.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.603086.

Compute 3 *5.603086=16.809258.

0.57142857 *5.603086.

0.5 *5.603086=2.801543.

0.07142857 *5.603086.

0.07 *5.603086=0.392216.

0.00142857 *5.603086≈0.008007.

So 0.392216 +0.008007=0.400223.

So 0.07142857 *5.603086≈0.400223.

So 0.57142857 *5.603086=2.801543 +0.400223=3.201766.

So total E_total =16.809258 +3.201766=20.011024 GeV.

So about 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Another approach: perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 6.015 u, but let me use more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula.

E = gamma * m c².

m =6.015122 u.

1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.015122 *1.66053906660e-27 kg = let's compute.

6 *1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.015122 *1.66053906660e-27 = (0.01 *1.66053906660e-27) + (0.005122 *1.66053906660e-27).

0.01 *1.66053906660e-27 =1.6605390666e-29 kg.

0.005122 *1.6605390666e-27 = approximately 0.005122 *1.6605390666e-27.

0.005 *1.6605390666e-27 =8.302695333e-30 kg.

0.000122 *1.6605390666e-27= 2.022679e-30 kg.

Total: 8.302695333e-30 +2.022679e-30=10.325374e-30 kg.

So total m =9.9632344e-27 +1.6605390666e-29 +1.0325374e-29.

Wait, 1.6605390666e-29 is 0.16605390666e-28.

1.0325374e-29 is 0.10325374e-28.

So adding these: 9.9632344e-27 + (0.16605390666e-28 +0.10325374e-28) )= 9.9632344e-27 + 0.2693076466e-28.

Which is 9.9632344e-27 + 2.693076466e-29.

Convert to same exponent: 9.9632344e-27 + 0.02693076466e-27 = (9.9632344 +0.02693076466) e-27 =9.99016516e-27 kg.

So m=9.99016516e-27 kg.

Now, E = gamma * m c².

gamma =3.571428571.

c=3e8 m/s.

So E =3.571428571 *9.99016516e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute (3e8)^2=9e16 m²/s².

So E =3.571428571 *9.99016516e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s².

Compute the units: kg m²/s² is J.

So compute 3.571428571 *9.99016516e-27 *9e16.

First, 9.99016516e-27 *9e16 = 89.91148644e-11 J.

3.571428571 *89.91148644e-11 = ?

3 *89.91148644e-11=269.7344593e-11.

0.571428571 *89.91148644e-11 ≈0.571428571*8.991148644e-10.

Wait, 89.91148644e-11 = 8.991148644e-10.

So 0.571428571 *8.991148644e-10 = ?

0.5 *8.991148644e-10 =4.495574322e-10.

0.071428571 *8.991148644e-10 ≈0.071428571 *8.991148644e-10.

Compute 0.07 *8.991148644e-10=0.6293803e-10.

0.001428571 *8.991148644e-10≈1.284e-12.

So sum: 0.6293803e-10 +1.284e-12=6.4222e-11.

So 0.071428571 *8.991148644e-10=6.4222e-11.

So total for 0.571428571 part: 4.495574322e-10 +6.4222e-11=4.559796322e-10.

So 3.571428571 *8.991148644e-10 J=269.7344593e-11 +4.559796322e-10.

Wait, 269.7344593e-11 is 2.697344593e-9 J.

4.559796322e-10 is 0.4559796322e-9 J.

So total E= (2.697344593 + 0.4559796322 )e-9 J=3.153324225e-9 J.

Now, convert to GeV: 3.153324225e-9 J / (1.602176634e-10 J/GeV) = (3.153324225 / 1.602176634 ) *10.

3.153324225 /1.602176634 ≈1.968.

So 1.968 *10=19.68 GeV.

Wait, that's another number. Now I'm getting 19.68 GeV. But earlier I had about 20.03 GeV. What's going on here?

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approach with 931.5 MeV/u is more straightforward.

Earlier calculation:

E_total =3.5714285 *5.603086 GeV=20.011 GeV.

But another approach gave me around 19.68 GeV, which is different. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of decimal places somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is around 20 GeV and the options are approximate.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the precise value using the exact numbers.

Let me compute gamma * m c² using the precise values.

gamma =3.571428571.

m =6.015122 u.

m c² =6.015122 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.015122 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015122 *931.5 MeV.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.005122 *931.5: 0.005 *931.5=4.6575 MeV. 0.000122 *931.5=0.1135 MeV.

So 4.6575 +0.1135=4.771 MeV.

So 0.015122 *931.5 =9.315 +4.771=14.086 MeV.

So m c²=5589 +14.086=5603.086 MeV=5.603086 GeV.

E_total =3.571428571 *5.603086 GeV.

Compute this:

3.571428571 *5.603086.

Compute 3 *5.603086 =16.809258.

0.571428571 *5.603086.

0.5 *5.603086 =2.801543.

0.071428571 *5.603086.

Let me compute this accurately.

0.07 *5.603086 =0.392216.

0.001428571 *5.603086≈0.008007.

So sum:0.392216 +0.008007=0.400223.

So 0.571428571 *5.603086=2.801543 +0.400223=3.201766 GeV.

So E_total=16.809258 +3.201766=20.011024 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So 20.011 GeV is closest to option C)20.132 GeV. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but why the difference? Let me see if I missed any steps.

Wait, perhaps the energy is per nucleon or per nucleus. No, the question is about the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I should account for the fact that RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so maybe the mass is per nucleon? No, the mass of the nucleus is correct as 6.015 u.

Wait, maybe the calculation should use the exact gamma value, which is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=3.571428571.

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation using more decimals would get closer to 20.132 GeV.

Wait, let me compute 3.571428571 *5.603086 GeV more accurately.

3.571428571 *5.603086.

Compute 3.571428571 *5.603086.

Let me compute using exact multiplication:

3.571428571

×5.603086

------------

Multiply each digit:

But this might take a while. Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately.

3.571428571 *5.603086.

Break it down:

3.571428571 *5 =17.857142855.

3.571428571 *0.603086.

Compute 3.571428571 *0.6 =2.1428571426.

3.571428571 *0.003086 =0.011005288.

So 2.1428571426 +0.011005288=2.1538624306.

So total E=17.857142855 +2.1538624306=20.0110052856 GeV.

Which is approx 20.011 GeV.

So why is option C 20.132 GeV?

Hmm. Perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like using kinetic energy as the total energy. Let me compute the kinetic energy.

E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.571428571.

So (3.571428571 -1)=2.571428571.

So E_kinetic =2.571428571 *5.603086 GeV.

Compute 2.571428571 *5.603086.

2.571428571 *5 =12.857142855.

2.571428571 *0.603086.

Compute 2.571428571 *0.6=1.5428571426.

2.571428571 *0.003086=0.007920857.

So sum:1.5428571426 +0.007920857=1.5507779996.

So E_kinetic =12.857142855 +1.5507779996=14.4079208546 GeV.

Which is about 14.408 GeV, but that's not among the options. So perhaps the question refers to the total energy, which is around 20.011 GeV. Since option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mass is 6.015122 u, but if I use a more precise value, perhaps it changes the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should use the precise value of 1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg, but I think that's already what I did.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses the speed v =0.96c as a fraction, and the exact gamma is 1/(sqrt(1-0.96^2)).

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

v² =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c²= 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So that's correct.

An alternative approach: perhaps the energy is given per nucleon, but the problem refers to the nucleus as a whole. No, the problem says the nucleus X's energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion when I calculated E in joules and converted to GeV.

Wait, E in J was 3.153e-9 J.

Wait no, earlier calculation got E=3.153e-9 J, which is 3.153e-9 /1.60218e-10 = approx 19.68 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I used the 931.5 MeV/u approach, it gave 20.01 GeV. So which is correct?

Wait, 6.015122 u *931.5 MeV/u=6.015122 *931.5=5603.08 MeV=5.60308 GeV.

E_total=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.60308=20.011 GeV.

But the joule-based approach gave me around 19.68 GeV. I must have made a mistake in the joule calculation.

Wait, let me recompute E in joules.

E =gamma * m c².

m =6.015122 u =6.015122 *1.660539e-27 kg =9.99016e-27 kg (approx).

c=3e8 m/s.

m c²=9.99016e-27 kg * (3e8)^2=9.99016e-27 *9e16=89.91144e-11 J.

Wait, 9.99016e-27 *9e16 = (9.99016 *9) * (1e-27 *1e16) )= 89.91144 *1e-11=8.991144e-10 J.

Now, gamma=3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *8.991144e-10 J.

Compute 3.57142857 *8.991144e-10.

3 *8.991144e-10=2.6973432e-9.

0.57142857 *8.991144e-10.

Compute 0.5 *8.991144e-10=4.495572e-10.

0.07142857 *8.991144e-10= approx 0.07142857 *8.991144e-10=6.420e-11.

So sum:4.495572e-10 +6.420e-11=5.137572e-10.

So total E=2.6973432e-9 +5.137572e-10=3.2111e-9 J.

Now, convert to GeV.

3.2111e-9 J /1.60218e-10 J/GeV= (3.2111 /1.60218 ) *10.

3.2111 /1.60218≈2.0036.

Multiply by 10:20.036 GeV.

Ah, so this gives 20.036 GeV, which is more in line with the earlier calculation using the 931 MeV/u approach.

So the precise calculation gives around 20.036 GeV.

Looking back at the options:

C)20.132 GeV.

D)21.419 GeV.

So option C is the closest.

But wait, why is there a discrepancy between the two approaches?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the J-based calculation when I thought it gave 19.68 GeV, but actually, it's 20.036 GeV.

So perhaps the correct answer is C)20.132 GeV.

But why is option C 20.132? Let me think about precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.571428571 *5.603086 GeV precisely.

5.603086 *3.571428571.

Let me compute it as:

5 *3.571428571 =17.857142855.

0.603086 *3.571428571.

Compute 0.6 *3.571428571 =2.1428571426.

0.003086 *3.571428571≈0.01100525.

So 2.1428571426 +0.01100525=2.15386239.

So sum is 17.857142855 +2.15386239=20.011005245 GeV.

So about 20.011 GeV.

If the options are precise to four decimal places, perhaps the intended answer is 20.011 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's 0.121 GeV higher.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact gamma.

Wait, what's sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)?

v=0.96c.

v² =0.9216 c².

1 -v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857...

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in considering the nucleus's mass as 6.015122 u, but perhaps the question refers to a different isotope.

Wait, the problem states "X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons", which is Li-6.

Yes, so the mass is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass energy as 6 GeV, which would be an approximation, leading to E=3.5714 *6=21.428 GeV, which is close to option D)21.419 GeV.

But why would they use 6 GeV instead of the precise 5.603 GeV?

Hmm. That would explain option D.

But I think the correct approach is to use the precise mass, leading to approximately 20.01 GeV, which is close to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the kinetic energy, but that would be about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B)23.069 GeV, but that's way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the energy in the question refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon. But that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given speed is beta =0.96, and the energy is the kinetic energy.

But then E_kinetic = (gamma -1 ) m c².

Which would be 2.5714 *5.603086 GeV≈14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the energy is calculated as the rest mass times gamma. The options given are in GeV, which is correct.

But perhaps the problem expects us to use the speed as a fraction of c, and compute the kinetic energy as (gamma -1) m c², but I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the speed in terms of beta, which is v/c=0.96, then gamma is 3.5714, and E=gamma * m c².

So I think the correct answer is approximately 20.01 GeV. Since option C is 20.132 GeV, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate more precise value of gamma.

Wait, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216 )=1/sqrt(0.0784 )=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to round to four decimal places, which would be 20.0110 GeV, but the options only go to three decimal places. So the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

But I'm not sure why it's 20.132. Alternatively, perhaps the precise calculation yields 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the m c² calculation.

Wait, recompute m c² with precise values.

m=6.015122 u.

1 u =931.5 MeV/c².

m c²=6.015122 *931.5 MeV=?

Compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.015122 *931.5= approx 14.086 MeV.

So m c²=5589 +14.086=5603.086 MeV=5.603086 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.603086 GeV=20.011 GeV.

So the precise answer is approximately 20.011 GeV.

The options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

But why is there a discrepancy of about 0.12 GeV?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different speed calculation, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula E = (1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) * m c², which is the same as gamma * m c².

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise values for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different mass, like 6 u.

If m=6 u, then m c²=6*931.5=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV≈3.57142857 *5.589≈20.03 GeV.

Hmm, that's even closer to option C.

Wait, but that's when m=6 u, not 6.015 u. So perhaps the problem expects that approximation.

In that case, E=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV=20.03 GeV, which is close to option C.

But the options' option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps rounding to four decimal places, 20.03 is not 20.13. So perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact formula without approximations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, the exact gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216 )=1/sqrt(0.0784 )=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Yes.

Hmm. I think despite the confusion, the correct answer is approximately 20.01 GeV, which is closest to option C)20.132 GeV.

But why the slight difference? Perhaps the problem expects a more precise calculation of the gamma or the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but the calculation should include the relativistic mass, but that's already accounted for.

Hmm.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy imparted to the nucleus, which is the relativistic total energy \( E = \gamma m c^2 \). Here, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy (\( m c^2 \))
The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately \( 6.015122 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m c^2 = 6.015122 \, u \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/u = 5603.086 \, \text{MeV} = 5.603086 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy (\( E \))
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.603086 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
\[
3 \times 5.603086 = 16.809258 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.603086 \approx 3.201766 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E = 16.809258 + 3.201766 = 20.011024 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

Thus, the closest match is **C) 20.132 GeV**.

### Final Answer:
**C) 20.132 GeV**
