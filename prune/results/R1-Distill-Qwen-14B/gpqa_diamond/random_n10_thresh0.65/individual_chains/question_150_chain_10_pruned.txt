Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's a bit tricky, but let's see.

The NMR data is provided. Let me write down the peaks:

- 9.72 ppm: triplet (t), 1H. That's a high chemical shift, likely an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's our aldehyde group.
- 6.98 ppm: doublet (d), 2H. Could be aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted?
- 6.51 ppm: doublet (d), 2H again. Also aromatic, maybe another set of para-substituted protons.
- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton or maybe some conjugated diene protons? But wait, this is a singlet, so maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic with two equivalent protons. Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system like a vinyl group.
- 3.66 ppm: doublet (d), 2H. This seems like a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative, maybe an oxygen. Like an ether or an ester. Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Wait, but looking at the molecular formula, we have 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen. So
