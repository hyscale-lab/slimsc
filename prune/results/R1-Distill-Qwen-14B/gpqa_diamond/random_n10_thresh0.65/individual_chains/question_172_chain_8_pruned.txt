Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation of atoms in stars, the Boltzmann equation plays a big role. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question states that in star 1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann factor should apply here.

Right, the Boltzmann distribution tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy. But wait, the problem says the excitation is twice as much for star_1. So maybe the ratio is n1/n2 = 2?

Wait, no, the question says that the number in a specific energy level is twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation level (n) is twice for star 1 compared to star 2. So n1/n2 = 2.

Also, the energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Let me note that delta E is E2 - E1, assuming E2 is higher than E1 because the excitation is happening into a higher energy state.

Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars, because it's the same element and same energy levels. So g1 and g2 would cancel out in the ratio. So the equation simplifies to (n1/n2) = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )^(-1), because E2 is higher than E1, so the exponent would have a negative when considering n2/n1.

Wait, let me get that right. The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 is higher, the exponent is negative, meaning n2 is less than n1, so the ratio n2/n1 is small.

In this problem, star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state as star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, wait, no: the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps it's
