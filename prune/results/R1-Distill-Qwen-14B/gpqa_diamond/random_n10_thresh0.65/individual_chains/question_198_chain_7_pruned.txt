Okay, so I've got this problem about cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions. Hmm, I remember that stability constants have something to do with the formation of complexes. Let's break it down.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the Co(SCN)_2 complexes, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ maybe? Or wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. And each has a different stability constant β.

So the problem is to find the percentage of the Co(SCN)_2 species. So first, I think we need to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations, then find the fraction that's the dithiocyanato complex, which would be the one with two SCN- ligands.

Wait, the stability constants: βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So for each complex, βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co] [SCN]^n). But wait, in solution, the total Co concentration is the sum
