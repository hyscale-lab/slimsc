Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The operator in question is P, and it's a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this often relate to angular momentum, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, muon... but maybe the type of particle doesn't matter much here, just the operator's structure.

The question is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 when the operator is acting along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is in x-z, meaning it's in the plane spanned by x and z. So the direction would have components (nx, 0, nz), right?

Wait, no, n is a unit vector, so it's in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero. So n = (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. But I'm not sure if I need to find nx and nz or if the eigenvector is expressed in terms of some angle θ.

Wait, the operator P is a vector, so the operator along direction n would be the dot product of P and n, that is P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because the components P_x, etc., are matrices, so this becomes a matrix operator.

The eigenvalue equation would then be (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector |ψ> is the one for which P·n acting on it gives (ħ/2) times the vector itself.

So first, I need to write down the matrix for P·n. Let's compute that.

Given that P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], P_y is (ħ/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]].

So P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Substituting the matrices:

nx * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out (ħ/2) to make it easier:

(ħ/2) [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Wait, let me check that. The first term is nx * [[0,1],[1,0]], so the elements are (0, nx), (nx, 0). Wait no, actually, when multiplied by (ħ/2), the elements are (0, nx*(ħ/2)), etc. Wait, no, I think I was right the first time. Let me recompute:

The nx term is nx * [[0,1],[1,0]], so the (1,1) element is 0, (1,2)
