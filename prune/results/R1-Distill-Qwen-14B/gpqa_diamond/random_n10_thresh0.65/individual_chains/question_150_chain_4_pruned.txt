Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. Hmm, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Looking at the NMR data might help me figure out what the structure is.

The NMR data is: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let me think about each of these signals.

The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet integrating for 1H. That region is usually aldehydic protons, so maybe there's an aldehyde group. But wait, sometimes it can be an acidic proton like an -NH or something else. But the triplet might suggest coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm.

Looking at the downfield region, the 9.72 might be an aldehyde. But I'm not sure yet. Let's look at the aromatic region. The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating for 2H. Those look like a pair of aromatic protons, perhaps from para-substituted benzene rings. Because if they're each a doublet, maybe they're in a para arrangement, making each other's coupling. Like two aromatic rings connected via substituents.

The 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe it's an exchangeable proton, like an -OH group. But wait, it's integrating for 2H, so maybe it's two -OH groups that are exchanging and not splitting each other? Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like an enol or something. Not sure yet.

The 3.66 is a doublet for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 group or something similar. So maybe there's an OCH2CH2... wait, but it's a doublet. If it's OCH2, maybe it's part of an ester or ether, or an alkoxy group attached to something else.

Putting this together, the molecule might have an aldehyde group, possibly two benzene rings attached, and some oxygen-containing groups. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation
