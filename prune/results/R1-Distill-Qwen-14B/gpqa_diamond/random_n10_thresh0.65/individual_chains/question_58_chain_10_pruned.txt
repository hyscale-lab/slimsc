Okay, so I've got this question here about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations. Regularization helps make those infinities manageable so you can calculate finite results. But some theories don't need it because they don't have these divergences, or maybe they handle them another way.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything. It deals with high energies, right? Because it's trying to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. I remember that in string theory, the basic building blocks are strings instead of point particles. But do they have divergences that need regularization? Or maybe because they're dealing with strings, the divergences are softer. Wait, but I'm not too sure about this. I think string theory might not require the same kind of regularization as other quantum field theories because the string perturbation series is finite or something. Or perhaps because it includes gravity, which might change how divergences appear.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes weakly coupled because of asymptotic freedom. But wait, QCD does involve dealing with things like the running coupling and renormalization. So I think QCD does require regularization because of divergences in loop calculations. Maybe it's particularly tricky because of confinement, but I'm not sure how that ties into regularization. Still, I think QCD needs regularization techniques like lattice QCD or other methods.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I remember that QED does have issues with divergent integrals when calculating things like the self-energy of electrons or the vacuum polarization. These divergences are handled using renormalization techniques. But wait, does that mean it requires regularization? Because regularization is a step in the renormalization process, I think QED does need regularization. Techniques like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc., are used.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, this is the non-quantum version. So in classical ED, Maxwell's equations, there's no concept of particles, just fields. Since it's a classical theory, it doesn't involve quantum divergences. So I guess regularization isn't a thing here because there are no divergent integrals in the same way as quantum theories. Wait, but even in classical electromagnetism, do we have any divergences? Like, point charges have issues with their own fields at the point. But I think those are more conceptual and handled by the Dirac delta function, but they aren't really divergent in the same way as in quantum theories. So maybe classical ED doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same kind of infinities that quantum theories have.

So putting it all together. The question is which theory never requires regularization at high energies.
