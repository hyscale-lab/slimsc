Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to figure out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Let's break it down.

Alright, the problem states that both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The shift in the spectral lines is given: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, what do I remember about the radial velocity method? I think the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves in response to the planet, and we detect this movement by shifts in the spectral lines.

The formula related to this is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity the star moves toward or away from us. I think K is given by the formula K = ( (G * (M_p) / (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) ) / ( (P * (1 day in seconds) )^(1/3) ) ) Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude equation.

Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) )^(1/3) )) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term becomes 1. Also, since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the equation simplifies.

Wait, let's write the simplified version. Since M_p << M_star, the formula becomes:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (P )^(1/3) ))
