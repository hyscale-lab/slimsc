Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. 

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both orbits are circular, so that simplifies things a bit. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, right? The formula I remember is something about the velocity semi-amplitude. Oh right, the formula is K = (V) = (G * (M_planet) )/( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3)  wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity shift and the orbital period.

Wait, the Doppler shift is related to the star's velocity towards or away from us. The RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. The formula for K is given by K = ( (2Ï€ G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, but another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/
