Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. I remember from special relativity that velocities don't just add up linearly because of the speed limit. Oh right, the velocity addition formula comes into play. But wait, is this scenario purely about the medium moving or about the light's speed in the medium?

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of the light from the lab frame?

Wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass from the lab's perspective. So the glass is moving, and the light is inside it. So the light's speed relative to the glass is c/n. But the glass itself is moving at v. So how do we combine these?

I think I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula here. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)). But wait, in this case, what is u? From the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. So from the lab frame,
