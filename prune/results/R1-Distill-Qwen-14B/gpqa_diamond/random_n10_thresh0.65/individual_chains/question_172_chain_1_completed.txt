Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when atoms are in a star's photosphere, especially in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), their energy levels are distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution. Oh wait, right, Boltzmann distribution describes the probability of particles being in different energy states based on temperature.

The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the ratio of their populations in that energy level is 2:1, star_1 to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), right? Since we're talking about the same energy levels but comparing two stars, maybe the difference is the transition between the same two levels in each star.

Wait, no, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Let me think. Let me denote the energy levels as E_1 (for star 1) and E_2 (for star 2), but wait, no—no, the energy difference is the same for both stars because it's the same element, iron. So, the energy levels are the same, but the excitation is different because of the temperature.

Wait, no, wait. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is fixed at 1.38e-23 J. So, that delta E is the same for both stars. So, for each star, their excitation in that energy level depends on their temperature.

In star_1, the number of atoms in a higher energy level (let's say level i) compared to a lower level (j) would be n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). But in this case, the problem says that the excitation of iron in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the population in that specific level is higher in star_1. Let's say that the energy levels are the same for both stars, because they're the same element, but the excitation is higher in star_1.

Wait, but the excitation is in a specific level. So, maybe the ratio of the populations in that level compared to the ground state (or another level) is different. Let me think. Let's say that the specific energy level has a certain energy E relative to a reference level, say the ground state. So, for star_1, the ratio of n_i to n_j (where i is the excited level and j is the lower) is twice that of star_2.

Wait, no, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the total number of excited atoms in that level is twice as much as in star_2. So, for each star, the population ratio of level i to level j is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So, for star_1: n1_i / n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2_i / n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that n1_i is twice n2_i. Wait, no, the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So, perhaps n1_i = 2 * n2_i. But wait, how is this ratio expressed? Because if the temperatures are different, the ratios would change. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excitation in star_1 to star_2 for the same level is 2. So, (n1_i / n1_j) / (n2_i / n2_j) = 2. But wait, because in each star, the ratio is determined by their respective temperatures. So, [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = 2.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the ratio of the excitation ratios is 2. So,

( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) / ( exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ) = 2.

Simplify this:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2.

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) ) = 2.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, wait, let me write that again:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

Wait, so:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But I can rearrange this equation to express in terms of T1 and T2.

Alternatively, let's factor out the negative sign:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

But wait, the problem gives us the value of ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the options don't include any numerical factors, so perhaps we can ignore the actual value of ΔE because the options are in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but the options are given as equations involving T1 and T2. So, let's see the options.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1

Hmm, what's the relation here? Let me see the expression I derived.

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, the problem statement gives us the value of ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute ΔE/(k). 

Planck's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K. Wait a minute! So, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K). So, ΔE = k * (some T?), but wait, no, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, ΔE = k * (something), but looking at the numbers, ΔE = k * (1 K), because k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so k * 1 K = 1.38e-23 J.

So, ΔE = k * (1 K), which makes ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So, substituting that into the equation:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves comparing the excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2, under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution governs the population of atoms in different energy levels, and the excitation ratio between the two stars is given as 2:1 (star_1 to star_2). The energy difference between the considered energy levels is provided as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

Using the Boltzmann equation, the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels for each star is:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( T \) is the temperature of the star and \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant (\( k \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)).

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}}}{\frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}} = 2.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = 2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
