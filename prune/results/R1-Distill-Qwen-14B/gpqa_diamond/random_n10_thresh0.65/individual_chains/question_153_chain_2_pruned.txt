Okay, so I've got this problem about the Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the correct reactants and products. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually from another carbonyl compound, like enolates. So in each of these three reactions, I need to identify what's the nucleophile and what's the electrophilic part.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. So, NaOEt is a base, and EtOH is the solvent. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. Since the reaction is in a base (NaOEt), the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. Its structure is like CH2(COOEt)2. When deprotonated at the alpha position (the CH2), it forms an enolate. This enolate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(=O)-OEt, but wait, the substituents are arranged as (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2-CH(C6H4-p-tolyl)=C-OEt? Or wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) connected to the acrylate. Let me draw this out mentally.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon, which doesn't make sense because acrylate is three carbons. Oh, wait, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. The substituent would be on the middle carbon. So, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-OEt? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's CH2=C(CO-OEt)-CH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, maybe I should think about the positions. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. The 3-position would be the CH2 before the double bond. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OEt, so the substituent at position 3 would be on the CH2 group, making it CH2-substituent-CH2-CO-OEt? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-configured, so the substituent is on the same side as the ester group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OEt, but that can't be right. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting confused, but perhaps it's better to proceed with the reaction.

So the Michael addition of dimethyl malonate enolate to the acrylate. The enolate attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So, the nucleophile (from malonate) will add to the less substituted carbon of the double bond. Wait, no, in Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon, which is the one next to the carbonyl. So, the acrylate has the carbonyl at the end, so the double bond is between C2 and C3 (if the carbonyl is C1). So the structure is CH2-CH2-CO
