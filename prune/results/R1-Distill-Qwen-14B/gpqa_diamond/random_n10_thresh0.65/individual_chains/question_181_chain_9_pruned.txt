Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps, and neutrinos are a byproduct of these reactions. The main reactions I think are the proton-proton (pp) chains, and there are a couple of branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, and then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches. Oh wait, right, the pp-III branch involves heavier elements.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from that process would cease, and we on Earth wouldn't detect any from that source anymore.

So the problem is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). We need to find the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2 after the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, so normally, neutrinos come from different reactions. I remember that the pp-III process produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the pp-I. Specifically, I think the pp-I produces lower-energy neutrinos, like around 200 keV or so. While the pp-III branch is involved in producing heavier elements and might emit higher-energy neutrinos, maybe in the hundreds of keV to a few MeV range.

So, the pp-III branch contributes more to higher energy neutrinos. If it stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop, but lower ones (like band 1) might not be as affected, or maybe the lower band would be from another process.

Wait, no. Let's think. The pp-III process might be a minor contributor compared to the main pp-I. So when pp-III stops, the higher-energy neutrinos (like in band 2, 800-900 keV) might have their flux reduced, but the lower band 1 (700-800) might still have some flux because other processes contribute there.

Wait, no, actually, the main source of high-energy neutrinos in the Sun is the CNO cycle, right? Or is that not correct. Wait, no, the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp chain. Or wait, maybe the CNO neutrinos are lower energy? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the dominant source of solar neutrinos are the proton-proton chain, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. The CNO cycle, which occurs in hotter and denser regions, produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, but the question is about the pp-III branch, not the CNO. So if pp-III stops, what's the impact on the neutrino flux in the two bands.

Hmm. Let me think about the neutrino energies from the pp-III process. The pp-III branch involves reactions that produce beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to form lithium-7. The neutrinos from this process are from the decay of beryllium-7 into lithium-7, which emits a neutrino. But I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have higher energies than those from the main pp-I.

Wait, so if the pp-III is stopped, the high-energy neutrinos (like above 800 keV) would decrease. The lower energy ones (like 700-800 keV) might have a different source. But wait, does the pp-III contribute to the lower band or higher?

Alternatively, I might have this mixed up. Let me recall: the pp-I chain produces neutrinos with energies up to about 400 keV, I think. The other branches, like pp-II and pp-III, might produce higher-energy neutrinos. Or maybe the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, the CNO
