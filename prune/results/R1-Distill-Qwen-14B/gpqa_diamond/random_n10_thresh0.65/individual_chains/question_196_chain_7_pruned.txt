Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't just use the simple classical formulas.

The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a spring with force constant k. The speed of light is c, which probably comes into play due to relativistic effects.

In the classical case, the maximum speed v_max would be when the potential energy (1/2 k A²) is converted into kinetic energy (1/2 m v²). So solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C looks like that. But wait, in relativity, things are different because of the energy-momentum relation and the speed approaching c.

So I must consider relativistic energy. The total energy in relativity isn't just kinetic plus potential in the same way. Oh wait, the total energy of a relativistic oscillator includes both the kinetic energy and the potential energy, and it's conserved.

In the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²), the kinetic energy, and the potential energy. At maximum displacement
