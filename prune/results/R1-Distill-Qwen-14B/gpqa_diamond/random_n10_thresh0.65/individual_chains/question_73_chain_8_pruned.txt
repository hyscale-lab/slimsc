Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical addition because that doesn't work. Oh right, I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, right? But when it comes to velocity, mass doesn't directly matter for the relative speed calculation, does it? Because the formula for adding velocities in relativity is about their speeds relative to the same frame.

So the two speeds given are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, wait, but which one is moving faster? Oh, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, same direction. So relative to each other, their speed difference would be... wait, no, because in relativity, it's not that straightforward. I can't just subtract the two speeds because if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't simply 0.1c. I need to apply the relativistic formula.

The formula for the relative velocity v_rel when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a rest frame is:

v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(cÂ²))

Wait no, wait, actually, I think the formula is:

v_rel = (u
