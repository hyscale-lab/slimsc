Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos produced by the Sun and how their flux changes under a certain condition. Hmm, neutrinos are tricky, but I think I remember some basics.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, what's the pp-III branch? Oh right, the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, and the pp-III branch is part of that chain. I think the pp-III branch involves higher energy reactions, maybe involving heavier elements.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, other reactions might take over. But the question says all other reactions remained as they were. Wait, no, I think it's that all other reactions remained as they were. Or did it? Wait, the question says "the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core... while all other reactions remained as they were." So, only pp-III is stopped, others continue.

But wait, neutrinos are produced via the pp chain, right? So the pp-I and pp-II might continue. Oh wait, the pp-III is a
