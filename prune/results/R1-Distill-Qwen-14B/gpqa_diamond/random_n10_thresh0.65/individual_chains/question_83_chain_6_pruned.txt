Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again. They diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85e-5.

Alright, so the first thing I should probably do is figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix equal volumes of a solution, the concentration halves. Oh wait, because M1V1 = M2V2, so if V doubles, M halves.

So the initial 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with equal volume. So the new concentration would be 0.025 M. Let me confirm that: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, diluted with 20 cm³, so total volume is 40 cm³. Moles of acetic acid would be 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Next, the titration with NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is a neutralization: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid present. Let me calculate the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid initially are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V would be (0.001 mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the question asks about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, wait. Wait, so equivalence is 10 cm
