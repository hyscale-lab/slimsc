Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and which symmetries must be respected by all operators in it. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators consistent with certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries those are.

The options given are four symmetries: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. And the possible answers are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what do I know about these symmetries? Let me think.

Lorentz symmetry is the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it's like the bigger symmetry group that includes both. So if Poincare is respected, Lorentz must be too, right? Because Poincare includes Lorentz.

CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetry. And then there's CPT symmetry, which is the combination of C, P, and T (time reversal) symmetries. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry because it combines the three. But wait, not all theories have CPT symmetry, but in the Standard Model, I think CPT is respected.

Now, SMEFT is an effective theory that respects the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So what symmetries does the Standard Model have? It respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincare (since that's part of the spacetime symmetry), and CPT, I believe. But does it respect CP symmetry? Wait, the
