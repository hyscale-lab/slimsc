Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this is a classic acid-base titration problem.

Alright, let's read the problem again carefully. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized and at the equivalence point.

Wait, wait. Wait, first, I should figure out the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = concentration × volume (in liters). So, the initial volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. The concentration is 0.05 M. So, 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol of acetic acid. Oh right, because M is mol/L, so 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Then, when titrating, the NaOH will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol. So we'll have a buffer solution because some of the acetic acid is neutralized, forming its conjugate base, acetate.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized, so we'll have the acetate ion in solution. Since NaOH is a strong base, the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic.

So let's handle each part: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Starting with 25% titration:

So the initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, moles of acetic acid left will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate formed will be 0.00025 mol. The total volume is still 40 cm³, but wait, when adding NaOH, does that change the volume? Hmm, probably not significantly, but in calculations, they might assume it's the same as the diluted solution's volume. Or maybe we should calculate the new volume. Wait, the problem says we titrate the solution, but the initial solution is 40 cm³. Then, when adding 25% of the required NaOH, the volume might change a bit, but for simplicity, perhaps they ignore it. Or maybe the problem assumes that the volume change is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the total volume when titrated is the initial solution's volume plus the volume of NaOH added. Hmm, but the question doesn't specify the volume of NaOH used at 25%, so maybe the solution assumes that the initial volume is 40 cm³ and the NaOH is
