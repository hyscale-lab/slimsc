Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

Wait, the key here is the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift depends on the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The formula for the Doppler shift relates the velocity to the wavelength shift.

The Doppler shift formula is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But in this case, the shifts are given in milliangstroms, so maybe I should relate the velocity shifts directly. Oh right, because for small velocities, the shift is proportional to velocity.

The RV method's formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - eÂ²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day)^(-1)) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun) and the planets' masses are similar, perhaps M_p is the same for both? The problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so I think we can assume M_p for both is the same. So M_p is same, M_star is same.

Wait, but does that mean that the velocity semi-amplitude K is the same for both planets? Wait, no, because the velocity shift depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. Oh, no, K also depends on the orbital period and the star's mass. Hmm.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is K
