Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. I remember that in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency and A is the amplitude. But wait, that's non-relativistic. In relativity, things get more complicated because as speeds approach the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. Oh right, maximum amplitude is A, mass is m, and we need to find v_max in terms of c, the speed of light.

Wait, the options given have some square roots and combinations involving c. So I'm thinking this is a relativistic equation of motion problem. Maybe using the relativistic form of energy.

I remember that in the relativistic case, the total energy E is given by gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But also, for the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement, since U = ½ k x². At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is maximum, so kinetic energy should be zero, right? And when the mass passes through the equilibrium position (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum, and potential energy is zero. Wait, but that's for classical mechanics. But in relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy.

Wait, but wait a second. In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, maybe the energy is quantized, but since the problem is about maximum speed, perhaps we're considering the point where the kinetic energy is maximum, which would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But how does that work in relativity?

Wait, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is conserved. So at the maximum amplitude A, all the energy is potential: E = ½ k A². Then, at the equilibrium point (x=0), all that energy is kinetic: ½ m v_max² = ½ k A², so v_max = sqrt(k
