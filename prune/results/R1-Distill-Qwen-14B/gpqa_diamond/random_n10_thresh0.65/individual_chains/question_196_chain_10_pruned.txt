Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. And we need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, so what do I remember about harmonic oscillators? In the classical case, a harmonic oscillator has potential energy proportional to x squared. The maximum speed occurs when the kinetic energy is at its peak, which is when the potential energy is zero (at the equilibrium point, x=0). But since this is relativistic, I guess special relativity effects come into play.

Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is found by equating the total energy (which is conserved) to kinetic energy. But with relativity, energy is conserved differently because of the relativistic mass increase. Or wait, maybe that's not exactly the case here.

Wait, the relativistic harmonic oscillator... I think I should start by considering the energy. In the classical case, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So the total energy E is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But in relativistic terms, the kinetic energy would be higher.

At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. Then, as it moves towards equilibrium, the potential energy converts into kinetic. At x=0, the velocity is maximum.

Wait, but in relativity, energy is conserved. So the total energy should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because in the relativistic scenario, the potential energy might be considered differently. Alternatively, maybe we treat the oscillator in a way that the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. Hmm.

Wait, in the non
