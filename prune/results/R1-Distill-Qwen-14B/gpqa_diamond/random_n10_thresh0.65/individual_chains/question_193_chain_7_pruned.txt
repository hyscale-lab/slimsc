Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says. 

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, so number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, wait, no. Parallax p is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So p = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I need to find N as a function of distance.

Given that N varies with 1/(plx)^5. Let's substitute plx with 1/d. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the number of stars increases with d^5? That seems a lot, but let me think. Because when you're looking further away, each shell at distance d has more stars. So for each unit increase in r (distance), how does the number change?

Wait, but wait. Let's not get confused. Let's think in terms of volume, because the number of stars in a volume would depend on density and volume. But here, the relation is given as number varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but let's approach it step by step. Let me write down the relations.

Given: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5

But plx = 1/d → plx^5 = 1/d^5 → 1/(plx^5) = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if r is the distance, then N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. So looking at the options, option B is ~ r^5.

Wait, but wait.
