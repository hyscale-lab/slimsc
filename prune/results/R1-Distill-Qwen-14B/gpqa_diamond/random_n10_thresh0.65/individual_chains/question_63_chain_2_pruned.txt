Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is currently in its fundamental state. I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with molecules, especially diatomic ones, their energy states involve both rotational and vibrational modes.

Wait, the model used here is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. So, this model includes both rotation and vibration, unlike the rigid rotor which only considers rotation. Or wait, no, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond doesn't stretch, while the non-rigid one allows for some vibration. Right.

So, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the first excited state would be the next possible energy level. But what's the next state? Do I have to consider both rotational and vibrational transitions?

Wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like j=0 or j=1? Wait, I think for rigid rotors, j can be 0,1,2,... but the ground state is j=0. But wait, for a diatomic, the rotational state is given by j, and the vibrational state by v.

So the fundamental state is v=0 and j=0. The next state
