Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, with reagent A, to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the structure is like CH2-C(O)-CH2. When you add NaCN, which is a nucleophile, probably a substitution reaction happens. But wait, butanone is a ketone. Oh, right! I remember that in the presence of a base, the ketone can be converted into an enolate, which can then react with a nucleophile like CN-.

But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, if we're using NaCN, maybe the solution is basic? Because NaCN is a sodium salt, so the solution might be basic. But wait, the product here is a nitrile, but with a hydroxyl group. Hmm, nitriles can be formed through substitution, but wait, the starting material is a ketone. Oh wait, maybe it's a cyanide addition to the carbonyl.

Wait, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So, when NaCN is added, the CN- might attack the carbonyl carbon. But in that case, the product would be a cyanohydrin. Oh right, that's correct! So butan-2-one reacting with NaCN in a basic condition would form a cyanohydrin. So the product would be (CH3)2
