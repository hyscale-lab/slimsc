Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's break it down step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromo something) react with a strong base like KOH, they usually undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. Wait, but wait—adamantane is a pretty rigid molecule, right? So the structure of adamantane is like a diamondoid, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two opposite faces, maybe?

Heating with KOH would likely lead to an E2 elimination. Each Br would leave, and the adjacent hydrogen would be abstracted, forming a double bond. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would form an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds?) or maybe just a single double bond. Wait, no—wait, elimination of two HBr molecules would form a conjugated diene or a single double bond? Hmm, actually, for 1,3-dihalides, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2 and another between C3 and C4? No, wait, no, because each elimination takes two adjacent carbons. Oh wait, no, wait, 1,3-dibromo means Br on C1 and C3. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2 and another between C3 and C4? That would form a conjugated diene. Or wait, maybe it's a single elimination, but that would require two adjacent Brs. Oh wait, wait—no, that's not the case here. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on C1 and C3. So when KOH is used, each Br would leave, but the positions are not adjacent. So perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, leading to two adjacent double bonds? Like 1,2-diene or something? Or maybe it's heated with KOH in a way that forms an epoxide? No, wait, KOH is a base, not an acid.

Wait, no, wait a second. Maybe I should think of this as a dehydrohalogenation. So each Br is on separate carbons. If it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps elimination would form a double bond between C1 and
