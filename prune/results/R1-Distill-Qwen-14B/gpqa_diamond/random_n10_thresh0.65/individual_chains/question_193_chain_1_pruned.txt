Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So the formula is Number of stars ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Wait, parallax is usually denoted by 'p' or 'plx' sometimes. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance—so higher parallax means closer objects.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, it's about the number of stars per unit range of distance, r. So I think they're asking for the density of stars as a function of distance. Or maybe the distribution—like, how many stars you'd expect to find as you move away at a certain distance.

Parallax (p) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So p = 1/d. Wait, no, actually, I think it's that distance is 1 over parallax. So d = 1/p. Because if p is measured in arcseconds, then d in parsecs is 1/p. For example, a parallax of 1 arcsecond would be 1 parsec away.

So if the number of stars varies as 1/p^5, then substituting p in terms of d, we have number ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. The reciprocal is d^5. So number of stars ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So number per unit distance. Hmm. So if the number is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance would be the derivative of that with respect to d, right? Because per unit distance is like a density.

So derivative of d^5 is 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So as distance increases, the number per unit distance increases with the fourth power.

Looking at the options, the choices are A: ~r^3, B: ~r^5, C: ~r^4, D: ~r^2. So the answer would be C, which is ~r^4.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The initial relation is 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance (per unit range). So
