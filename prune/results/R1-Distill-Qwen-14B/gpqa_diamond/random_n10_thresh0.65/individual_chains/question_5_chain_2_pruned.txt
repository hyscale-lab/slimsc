Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each expressed as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, so the operator P is a vector operator, meaning P = (P_x, P_y, P_z), and it's along some direction n. Oh right, the direction n lies in the x-z plane, so it's an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. That means the angle θ would be the polar angle from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ would be zero because it's in the x-z plane. Or wait, no, because in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, depending on the direction. But maybe we can model n as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in x-z, φ is fixed? Or perhaps φ can vary, but for this problem, maybe it doesn't matter because the eigenvector might be expressed in terms of θ and φ.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector of P in the direction of n. So I think the operator P is actually given by the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So the operator in the direction n is P·n̂, where n̂ is the unit vector in the direction of n.

So the operator we're interested in is P·n, where n is a vector in the x-z plane. Let me think. n can be written as (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in x-z. But since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ), right?

So the operator P·n would be P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z, because the y-component of n is zero. So it's (P_x * cosθ) + (P_z * sinθ).

The eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2 is what we're after. So we're looking for a vector |ψ> such that (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So first, I need to find the matrix representation of P·n. Let me write down the matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z.

Given:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P·n = P_x * cosθ + P_z * sinθ, because the y-component is zero.

So let's compute that matrix.

First, the P_x matrix multiplied by cosθ: (ħ/2) cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Similarly, P_z matrix multiplied by sinθ: (ħ/2) sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding them together:

P·n = (ħ/2)( cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let's compute each element.

The (1,1) element is (ħ/2)( sinθ * 1 ) = (ħ/2) sinθ.

The (1,2) element is (ħ/2)( cosθ * 1 ) = (ħ/2) cosθ.

The (2,1) element is (ħ/2)( cosθ * 1 ) = same as (1,2), but complex conjugate? Wait no, in matrices, the (2,1) element would be (ħ/2) cosθ, same as (1,2) because in P_x, the matrix is symmetric.

Wait no, wait. When I add the matrices, the (1,2) element is (ħ/2) cosθ, and the (2,1) is (ħ/2) cosθ as well. Because in the P_x matrix, (2,1) is 1, multiplied by cosθ. So the matrix becomes:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ [ sinθ, cosθ ],
               [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ]

Wait, let me re-do that:

P_x is [[0, 1],[1, 0]], and when multiplied by cos
