Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and spectrographs. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. Let me read the question carefully.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude. HIRES at Keck can observe brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than 17 in ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 in HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V ≤17. HIRES observes brighter than 16, so apparent V ≤16. So, the star's apparent V mag has to be ≤16 because both need to detect it. Because if a star is 17, ESPRESSO can detect it, but HIRES can't. So the apparent mag must be ≤16 for both. Wait, no, wait: the question says both can detect. So a star must be observable by both. So, the apparent V must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO, and ≤16 for HIRES. So the star must have apparent V ≤16 because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, no, let me think again. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So the apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars must be brighter than
