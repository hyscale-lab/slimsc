Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars with spots and exoplanets causing brightness variations. Hmm, I need to figure out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is like R_sun. The star's Teff is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, what's filling factor? Oh right, it's the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So 20% of the star's surface is spots.

The spots themselves have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So, the spots are cooler because they're dark. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so the spots must be at 5000 K? Because 6000 - 1000 is 5000. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? No, dark spots are cooler. So spots are 5000 K.

Now, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. This causes brightness variations because the hotter (or cooler) regions change which part of the star we see. But in this case, it's producing a signal that looks like an exoplanet transit. But the question is, if the star wasn't spotted, what size of exoplanet would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

So, the observed variation comes from two effects: the spots modulating the star's brightness as they rotate, and the exoplanet blocking part of the star's disk as it transits. But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation.

Wait, the problem says that the star's situation (with spots) can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the photometric variations caused by the spots are similar to those caused by a transiting planet. So, the light curve amplitude (the dip in brightness) from the spots is same as the dip from a planet.

We need to find R_planet / R_star such that the dip is the same as that caused by the spots.

First, I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots.

The star without spots would have a certain brightness. With spots, because they're cooler, the total brightness would vary as the spots rotate into view. So how does that work?

Wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into our view
