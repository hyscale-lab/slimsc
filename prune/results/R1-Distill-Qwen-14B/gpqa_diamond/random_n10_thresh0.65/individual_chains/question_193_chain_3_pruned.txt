Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds), right? So d = 1 / plx.

Wait, wait. So parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance increases, parallax decreases. Like, closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The problem says the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ (1/plx)^5.

But since plx is 1/d, maybe I can express N in terms of d instead of plx. Let's see. Because plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting that in, N ∝ (d)^5.

Wait, but the question is about how N changes with distance, so as d increases, how does N change? Wait, no, wait a minute. Because N is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases as well.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's about per unit range of distance. So when you go from, say, d to d + dr, how much does N change? Or, how does N vary as a function of r, where r is distance.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. And since plx = 1/d, 1/plx = d. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if I have a range of distances, say from r to r + dr, how many stars are there in that range?

Wait, I think I should model this with calculus. Because the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell (which is 4
