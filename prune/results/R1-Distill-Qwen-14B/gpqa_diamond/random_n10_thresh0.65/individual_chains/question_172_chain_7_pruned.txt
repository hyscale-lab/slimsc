Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. I need to figure out which equation is correct based on the given information. Hmm, let's think this through step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of the star where photosynthesis happens—wait, no, that's plants. Photosphere is the outer part of a star where light is emitted, right. And they're in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So each small region is in equilibrium with its own temperature.

So, the energy difference between the energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. I remember that the excitation of atoms relates to temperature through the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states.

The Boltzmann factor is (g_j / g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the ratio of excitation is given. Iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2 for the same energy level. So, the excitation ratio is [N1/N2] = 2, where N1 and N2 are the number of excited atoms in star_1 and star_2, respectively.

Wait, but the same energy level? Or different energy levels? The question says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is about that value. Oh wait, maybe they're comparing the same energy level in each star. Hmm, I might have to read the question again.

Wait, the question says that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the energy difference is the same. So each star has two energy levels, E_high and E_low, with a difference of 1.38e-23 J.

The excitation ratio for each star would be given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio N_upper1 / N_lower1 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ). Similarly, for star 2, N_upper2 / N_lower2 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ).

But wait, the same energy levels are being compared, so the statistical weights (g) would be the same for both stars. So the
