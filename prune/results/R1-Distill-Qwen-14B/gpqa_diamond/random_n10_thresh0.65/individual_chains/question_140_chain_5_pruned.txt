Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Another part says that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes.

Hmm. Okay, let's break this down.

First, think about the possible substances. I'm thinking that Substance X is probably a strong base or a metal. Since it reacts with a liquid (maybe an acid) to produce a gas. The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, what gases have that?

Let me think: If W is H2O, then H and O. But H has 1 proton, O has 8. No, that's not same. Wait, maybe CO2? No, because C has 6 protons, O has 8, so no. Oh, wait, maybe CH4? No, that's not a gas from such reactions. Or maybe NH3? No, because N has 7, H has 1. Wait, I'm confused.

Wait, the gas's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. So, for example, if it's H2O, each molecule has 2+8=10 protons, and 1*2 +8 = 10 neutrons? Or wait, no, wait. Each molecule: the sum of protons is equal to the sum of neutrons?

Alternatively, maybe each atom in the molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. Hmm, but that's probably not the case. Let me think of simple possibilities.

Wait, if the gas is CH4, each molecule has 4 H's (1 each) and C (6). 4+6=10 protons, but what about neutrons? C has 6 neutrons (since it's the isotope, but wait, if it's the average, but in reality, C-12 has 6, C-13 has 7. But maybe for simplicity, let's think of the most common isotope). So CH4: 4 H (each 1p, 0 neutrons?), but wait, hydrogen can have isotopes. Hmm, this might complicate.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like O2 or N2. If gas W is O2, then each molecule has 2 O atoms. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since O-16 is most common). So each molecule has 2*(8) protons and 2*(8) neutrons. So total protons: 16, neutrons: 16. So same number. That fits. So W could be O2?

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic gas. So if that's the case, what's the reaction? The reaction of X with Y (liquid) produces O2. Hmm. X
