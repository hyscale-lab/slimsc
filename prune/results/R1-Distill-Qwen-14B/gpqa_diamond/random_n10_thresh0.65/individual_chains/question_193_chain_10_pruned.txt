Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the relationship is N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are various powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when viewed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I think is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs) — right? So distance d = 1 / plx. Because if plx is small, the distance is large.

Wait, yeah, because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So d ∝ 1/plx.

The problem states that the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since d is 1/plx, I can write plx as 1/d. Let me substitute that into the equation.

So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 → which is 1/(1/d^5) → which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Oh, but wait, the question is about how N changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, if N is proportional to d^5, that means as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power. But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you look further away, you can see fewer stars, not more. Or wait, maybe I'm getting the setup wrong. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." Oh, so when plx is small (which means distance is large), 1/plx^5 becomes larger. So N increases as distance increases. But that seems counterintuitive because if you're looking further away, you might expect the number of stars in a given region to decrease because each star is dimmer and perhaps we can't see as many. Hmm, maybe the question is about a specific region, not the entire sky.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that in a certain region, the number of stars you observe depends on the parallax in that way. So for a given area in the sky, the number of stars you count is proportional to 1/plx^5. So how does N change with distance?

Wait, parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. So d = 1/pl
