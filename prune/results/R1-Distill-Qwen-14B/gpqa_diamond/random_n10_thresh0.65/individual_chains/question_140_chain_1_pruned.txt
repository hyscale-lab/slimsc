Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

The question talks about Substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, I'm thinking, if a molecule has equal protons and neutrons, what could that be? Well, let's see. Hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 neutron in its isotope deuterium. But wait, W is a gas, so maybe it's something like H2 gas? Or another diatomic gas.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Hmm, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Wait, that's close to the melting point of which element? Oh, maybe something like iodine? No, iodine's melting point is around 113°C. Wait, maybe it's something else. Oh! Mercury's melting point is about 234 K, which is lower. Wait, maybe it's something like bromine? No, bromine is liquid at room temp. Wait, wait. Let me think. Oh! Maybe it's sodium chloride, but no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the compound is something else. Wait, the melting point of 277 K is 4 degrees Celsius, so that's just a bit above 0. Which substance is that? Oh! Maybe it's a diatomic element. Wait, maybe it's a metal that's solid near that temp. Hmm... Alternatively, maybe B is water? No, water's melting point is 273 K, which is 0°C. Oh wait, 277 K is 4°C, so maybe it's not water. Wait, maybe it's a different substance. Let me think. Maybe B is a diatomic gas, but no, because if you heat a precipitate and get a substance with that melting point, perhaps it's a metal that becomes a liquid at that temp. Or maybe B is another compound. Hmm. Maybe B is a diatomic liquid at that temp. Wait, perhaps B is a diatomic element. Wait, what about hydrogen? No, that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe W is H2, and B is something else. I'm a bit stuck on this part.

Also, the precipitate G is formed. So, perhaps this is a double displacement reaction where X and Y form a precipitate and a gas. For example, if Y is an acid and X is a metal, the reaction would produce hydrogen gas and a precipitate of metal hydroxide if it's a weak acid. But let's think about the details.

Let me think about the other parts of the problem. The product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. Wait, perhaps X is a base like NaOH? Because if a keto acid reacts with a base, it might form a salt and water. So if the product has two oxygen atoms, maybe the salt has a formula like RCOO^- something. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the product of the keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, the product is probably a salt. For example, acetic acid (a keto acid) reacts with NaOH to form sodium acetate and water. Sodium acetate has formula CH3COONa, which has
