Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. 

Alright, let's start by reading the problem again. There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that, so 2*1.6e-19 C or something? But wait, maybe I don't need to plug in the numbers yet.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. And the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So I think I'm supposed to calculate the electric potential energy of this setup.

Wait, but how does that work? So point P has a fixed charge, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2m from P. So each of those 12 is 2m away from the fixed charge at P. Oh, but wait, each of them is 2m away from P, but what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Because if they're all at the same point (2m from P), then their mutual distances would be zero? But that can't be right because they can't all be at the same spot. Hmm, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. Maybe they're arranged in a sphere or something, but since the problem doesn't specify their arrangement among themselves, maybe I'm supposed to assume that their mutual distances don't contribute to the potential energy? Or perhaps I'm only considering the
