Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They mention that because of these spots, when the star rotates, its brightness changes periodically, which can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is, if there were no spots, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation as these spots do?

Hmm, so the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet blocking the star's light. So I need to calculate the relative change in brightness for both scenarios and set them equal, then solve for the planet's radius relative to the star.

I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula I think is (R_planet / R_star)^2. So I'll need to calculate that.

But first, let's tackle the star's brightness variation due to the spots. The star is a hemisphere covered in spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I believe refers to the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So the area of the spotted region is 0.2 times half the star's surface area.

Wait, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. Since it's one hemisphere (so 50% of the star's surface), the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π R_star² / 2) ? Or maybe it's 0.2 of the hemisphere, so 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) because the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R², wait no, 4π R² is the total. No, wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4π R². So a hemisphere would be 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, another way: the entire star's surface area is 4π R². The hemisphere is 2π R². So if the filling factor is 20%, that's 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R² of spotted area.

Each spot is cooler. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. So the flux from the spots is lower.

The total flux from the star without spots would be the same as a uniformly distributed star. But with spots, the flux will dip when the spots are on the side facing us. Wait, no. Actually, when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away, causing a periodic change in brightness.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So I need to calculate the difference in brightness when the spots are on the side facing Earth versus when they're not.

The star's total lumin
