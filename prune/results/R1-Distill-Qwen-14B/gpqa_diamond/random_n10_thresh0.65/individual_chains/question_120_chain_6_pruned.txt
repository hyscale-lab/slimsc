Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think this through.

So, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. I think that means the same number of stars are spread out in all directions, right? Parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. Oh wait, right, parallax (usually denoted as 'plx') is inversely proportional to distance. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax, and a more distant star has a smaller parallax.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit of parallax (so like per light-year or something) changes as parallax changes. The options are inverse to different powers of plx: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I remember something about the volume of space and how stars are counted. Oh wait, the number of stars you can see in a certain volume depends on that volume. But since parallax relates to distance, I need to find a relationship between parallax and the number of stars in a range of parallaxes.

Parallax plx is equal to 1/distance, so distance d is 1/plx. That makes sense. Now, if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what is the corresponding distance range?

Wait, let's think in terms of distance. Let me consider two parallaxes, plx and plx + dplx. Their corresponding distances would be d = 1/(plx) and d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, but when plx is small, adding a small dplx changes the distance by a larger amount. Hmm, maybe I should find the relationship between a change in plx and a change in distance, or perhaps find the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance.

Because the number of stars depends on the volume of space. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a region is proportional to the volume of that region. So if I have a spherical shell between distances d and d + dd, the volume would be 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell's volume is the difference between two spheres: (4/3)π(d+dd)^3 - (4/3)πd^3. Expanding that, it's approximately 4πd² dd when dd is small.

But wait, since d = 1/plx, let's express this in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. The volume of the shell is 4πd² dd. But what's dd in terms of plx and dplx?

Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx is -1/plx². So dd is negative when dplx is positive, but for volume, we take the absolute value, so it's (1/plx²) dplx.

Substituting d = 1/plx into the volume expression:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, let me double-check that. Wait, d is 1/plx, so d squared is (1/plx)^2
