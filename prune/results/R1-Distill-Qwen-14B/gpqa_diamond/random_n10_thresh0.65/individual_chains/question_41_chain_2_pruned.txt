Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer, right? What happens when the medium is moving?

Oh, right, this is probably about relativistic effects or maybe just Galilean addition. Wait, but Galilean addition applies when velocities are much less than c, but in reality, we should use special relativity. But wait, the problem states to take c=1, which might be a hint that we're considering the speed in terms of units where c is 1. But I'm not sure if that affects the approach.

Wait, the problem is asking for the speed of light in the glass as seen by the lab observer. So the glass is moving, and light is inside it. So I need to consider how the glass's motion affects the observed speed of light.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is v_light = c/n. But from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass's frame, we need to find the speed of the light.

Wait, but in classical mechanics, you'd just add the velocities. Like, if the glass is moving at v and the light is moving at (c/n) in the same direction, then the observed speed would be (
