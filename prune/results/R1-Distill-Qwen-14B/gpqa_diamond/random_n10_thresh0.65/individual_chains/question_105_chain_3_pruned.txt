Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a star with some spots that are causing brightness variations, and how that compares to an exoplanet's effect. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, if part of a star is cooler and has spots, that could mimic a planet's effect.

So, the problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means 20% of the hemisphere is covered. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. But the question is about brightness variations when one hemisphere is spotted, and how that compares to an exoplanet's effect.

Wait, the setup says that the photometric observations show periodic variations because the star is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view. But the problem states that this situation can resemble an exoplanet. So, the idea is that the spot-induced brightness variation has the same amplitude as a planet blocking some light.

The question is asking, what radius would a hypothetical exoplanet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve. So, I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip in brightness is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Let me think about how each effect contributes to the brightness variation.

First, for the planet transit: the dip in brightness (the transit depth) is proportional to (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So, if the planet's radius is Rpl and the star's radius is Rstar, the area blocked is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 of the star's disk.

Now, the star with spots: each spot is cooler. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness because the spots emit less light.

The star's total brightness without spots would be higher. But when a spot is visible, the brightness decreases. The amount of decrease depends on the area of the spots and how much cooler they are.

So, the total brightness variation due to spots would be the sum of each spot's contribution. But since the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots come into view over time.

Wait, let me model this. The star emits a certain amount of light, and when a spot is visible, it reduces the observed flux. The key point is that the spots are covering a certain fraction of the star's surface.

The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So, each hemisphere is 20% covered in spots. But since the star is a sphere, the total area covered by spots is (0.2) * (4π Rstar² / 2 )? Wait, no. Wait, each hemisphere is half the surface area of the star. So, the area covered is 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) = 0.4 π Rstar². Hmm, or wait, perhaps the filling factor is per hemisphere, so the total area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2π R²) * (1/2) )? No, wait, I think the hemisphere area is 2π R². So 20% of that is
