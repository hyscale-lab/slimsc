Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, I remember that when dibromides are treated with a strong base like KOH, they usually undergo elimination reactions. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane heating with KOH would likely form an alkene. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, removing two bromine atoms from adjacent carbons would lead to an allene or maybe a trans-alkene? Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the bromines on adjacent carbons in a ring structure. Wait, no, adamantane is a cage structure, so 1,3 positions are not adjacent. Maybe the structure is such that elimination forms a double bond. Oh right, when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) are treated with a base, they eliminate to form alkenes. So in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, I think after elimination, it forms an adamantene with a double bond. But wait, I might be mixing up the positions. Let me think again: 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably refers to two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So when KOH is added, they eliminate to form an alkene. So product 1 is likely 1,3-diene or an alkene. But let me check the NMR.

The product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, that doesn't make sense because elimination would form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Oh wait
