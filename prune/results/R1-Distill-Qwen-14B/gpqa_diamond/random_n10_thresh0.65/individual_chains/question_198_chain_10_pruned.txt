Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are related to the formation of complexes. Let me try to break this down.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. 

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So I think they're asking about the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. The options are A to D, and I need to calculate which percentage it corresponds to.

I remember that the fraction of a complex can be calculated using the stability constants and concentrations. The general formula for the fraction is based on the formation of each complex step by step.

Let me think about the possible complexes. Cobalt can form different complexes with SCN-. The first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, third is [Co(SCN)_3]^- maybe, and the fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the charge depends on the number of SCN- and the oxidation state of Co. Co is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So:

[Co(SCN)]^+ → Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is +2 -1 = +1? Or wait, wait. No, the complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, so that would be Co^2+ plus one SCN^- (charge -1). So overall charge is 2+ -1 = +1? Hmm, not too sure. But maybe the specifics of the charge don't matter for the calculation here, but the order of the complexes does.

The stability constants are given in order β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β represents the formation of the next complex. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

So the complexes are:

1. [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1 = 9.
2. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2 =40.
