Okay, I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the problem carefully.

So, the question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The key here is their apparent magnitudes because each instrument has a different brightness limit.

First, let me note down the important information:

- ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, any star with V mag ≤ 17 can be observed.
- HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, any star with V mag ≤ 16 can be observed.

Wait, no, I think I have that backwards. Because the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, actually, magnitude works in a way where lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its V magnitude is less than 17. Because, for example, a star at 16 mag is brighter than 17 mag.

Wait, this needs to be clear. Apparent magnitude is such that lower numbers mean brighter stars. So, if ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, that means their V mag is less than 17. Because a V mag of 17 is fainter than 16, which is brighter.

So for ESPRESSO, detectable stars have V ≤ 17.

For HIRES, stars must be ≤16 mag.

So, a star can be detected by both if its apparent V magnitude is ≤16 because that's the brighter limit for HIRES, and also ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So the overlapping condition is V ≤16.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Wait, no, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, stars with V mag less than or equal to 16. Because, for example, a star with V=15 is brighter than 16. So HIRES can see it. But a star with V=17 would be fainter than 16, so HIRES can't.

ESPRESSO can observe up to V=17. So any star with V ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and those with
