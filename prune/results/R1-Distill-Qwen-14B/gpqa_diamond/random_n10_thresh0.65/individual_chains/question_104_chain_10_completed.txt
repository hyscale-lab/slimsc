Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity, right, that's the method where you look for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum because the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift tells you about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both stars are like our Sun. So, their masses are equal, M, same as Sun's mass.

They detected the planets using the RV method. The spectral line shifts—Planet #1's star had a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's was 7 milliangstroms. Wait, milliangstrom is a thousandth of an angstrom, right? So 5e-3 angstrom and 7e-3 angstrom.

The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So, P2/P1 equals what?

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the star's mass, the planet's mass, and the orbital parameters. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) / (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(2/3) ) )) * (1/( (1/( (1-e²)^(1/2) )) ) ) Wait, no, I think I'm mixing it up. Maybe I should look for the formula that relates the semi-amplitude K to the orbital period.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, I think M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So simplifying, K ≈ ( (2πG) / (P c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, let me think again. Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude can be expressed as:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P * c) )^(1/3 )

Hmm, maybe I should think about the relation between the semi-amplitude and the period, given that M_p and M_* are same for both planets, but wait no. Wait, the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, but it doesn't say they're the same mass. Oh wait, but the question says the planets have masses similar to Neptune, but does it state that the masses are the same? Let me check the question again.

The question states: both have masses similar to that of Neptune. So assuming their masses are same, M_p1 ≈ M_p2. Both stars have same masses, M_*. So the formula for K would depend on P and the inclination (sin i), but since we don't know the inclinations, perhaps we can assume that for both, sin i is the same. Or maybe the formula doesn't require it because the shifts are measured, so the actual K is what's given. So, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes would relate to the ratio of (something involving periods).

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * P * M_p ) / (2π c^3 (M_* + M_p)^2) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But if e is zero (circular orbits), then K is proportional to [ (P M_p) / (M_*^2) ) ]^(1/3), but wait, maybe that's not the exact form.

Alternatively, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (8 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) ) * ( (1) / (P^ (1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think of the relation between K and the period.

Assuming that the masses of the stars are the same, and the planet masses are the same (since both are Neptune-like), and assuming sin i is the same for both (like same inclination angle), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ (1/P^(1/3)) ), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (2 pi)/(c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)) )

Since e=0 for both, and M_p << M_*, then (M_* + M_p) ≈ M_*. So,

K ≈ [ (G M_p ) / M_* ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2 pi / (c P) ) ]^(1/3 )

So K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)), because [1/P]^(1/3) is 1/(P^(1/3)). So,

K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3))

Which implies, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Because K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So solving for P2/P1:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

But wait, the semi-amplitude K is given inversely. Because if the star is moving more (higher K), that would correspond to a shorter period, right? Because a shorter period means the star is moving faster in its orbit. Hmm.

Wait, let's take an example. For a planet with a very short period (like Mercury), the star's velocity would be higher because it's moving in a tight orbit. For a planet with a longer period (like Jupiter), the star's velocity would be lower because it's moving more slowly in a larger orbit.

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2 is larger than K1. So, according to the formula, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1) / (K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (5)/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Thus,

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3

Wait, 5/7 is approximately 0.714.

So 0.714 cubed is approximately 0.714 * 0.714 = 0.510, multiplied by 0.714 again is about 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So (P2)/(P1) is 0.36... which is about 0.36 times. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times planet #1's. So P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is ~0.36. So the answer is ~0.36, which is option A.

But wait, let me check the options. The options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the correct answer would be A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's redo the math.

K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So:

K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Rearranged: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Given that K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 / P1 ≈ 0.364, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter. So the question asks "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1." So P2 is shorter, so the ratio is less than one. So the correct answer is A, ~0.36.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), assuming the masses of the stars and planets are the same, and the orbits are circular. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

From this, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) is related to the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \), we get:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

The problem states that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \), and then cubing this value:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx 0.714^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the ratio \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) is approximately 0.36.

From the given options:

- **A) ~0.36**: Correct, as calculated above.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived ratio.
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived ratio.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived ratio.

The correct answer is **A**, as the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Answer: A
