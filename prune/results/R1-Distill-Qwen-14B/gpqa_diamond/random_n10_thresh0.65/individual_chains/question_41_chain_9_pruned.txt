Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving. Does that affect the speed of light inside it? I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer, right?

But in this case, the medium (the glass) is moving. So I think I need to consider the Doppler effect or maybe some sort of velocity addition. Oh wait, no, the Doppler effect usually deals with the frequency or wavelength change when the source or medium is moving, but here we're talking about the speed of light as observed.

Wait, but the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But in this case, the light is in a medium, so it's moving at v_medium = c/n relative to the medium. But the medium itself (the glass) is moving. So from the lab frame, what's the overall speed?

Let me think in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light inside the glass has a velocity of c/n relative to the glass. Since the light
