Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Wait, Li with 3 neutrons—oh right, that's lithium-6, because Li usually has 3 protons and 3 neutrons make it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, I suppose. Now, I need to find the energy of the RHIC when this nucleus is moving at 0.96c.

I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a moving particle is given by the relativistic energy equation. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So first, I should calculate gamma. The speed v is 0.96c. So let me plug that in.

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² → 0.9216 c². So v²/c² is 0.9216.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me
