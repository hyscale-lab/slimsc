Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and some formula involving Miller indices. Let me think about what I know.

First, I recall that in crystallography, the interplanar distance (d) between planes in a crystal lattice is given by the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ), but wait, I think that's for cubic systems. Oh right, because rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system, but wait, no, rhombohedral is a special case of the cubic system where all edges are equal and the angles are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So the formula might be a bit different.

Wait, maybe I should use the general form for interplanar distance in any crystal system. The general formula involves the metric tensor. I think the correct formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) / (a²) ) multiplied by some factor involving the angles. Oh right, because in non-cubic systems, the lattice parameters vary with angles. 

Wait, the formula for d in a general crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) * ( (1/a²) * (cos² α + cos² β + cos² γ - 2 cos α cos β cos γ) ) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system. Since in rhombohedral, all a, b, c are equal, and all angles α, β, γ are equal. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Another approach: For a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hkl)(1 + 2 cosθ) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula involving the dot product of the plane normals.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - (h k + k l + l h) (1 +
