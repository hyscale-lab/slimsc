Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different dependencies on plx.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So distance d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, does that mean their actual number density is uniform, or that their distribution in the sky is uniform? I think it's the former, that there's the same number of stars per unit volume in space. So like, the density is constant as you go further out.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. But how does volume relate to parallax? Well, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So larger parallax means closer stars.

Let me think about the volume. The volume of a sphere with radius d is (4/3)πd³. So the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dd would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density (which is constant). So number of stars dN = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density.

But the question is about the number per unit of parallax. So I need to express this in terms of plx. Since plx (p) = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So I can substitute d with 1/p in the expression.

So let me rewrite the expression. dN = n * 4π (1/p)² * (d(1/p)). Wait, what's d(1/p) in terms of dp? Because d is 1/p, so the derivative of d with respect to p is dd/dp = -1/p². Hmm, but I'm integrating over p, so maybe I should express the volume element in terms of p.

Alternatively, let's express d in terms of p. So d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. But since we're considering a thin shell, the volume element would involve dV, which in spherical shells is 4πd² dd. So substituting d = 1/p, d² becomes 1/p², and dd is -1/p² dp. Wait, but I need to be careful with the limits because as p increases, d decreases.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the number of stars per unit parallax interval. So, for a given parallax p, how many stars are there per unit p? Since p = 1/d, small changes in p correspond to changes in d. So if I have a range of parallax from p to p + dp, I can find the corresponding range in distance.

But since we're talking about a unit range of parallax, perhaps we're considering a small interval dp. So the number of stars in a thin shell from d to d + dd would be n * 4πd² dd. But we need to express this in terms of p.

So, d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But for the volume element, we can take absolute values, so dd = (1/p²) dp.

Now, substituting d into the expression for dN:

dN = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp

Wait, that's because d² is (1/p)^2, and dd is (1/p²) dp. So (1/p)^2 multiplied by 1/p² is 1/p^4. So dN = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So per unit dp, how many stars? So dN/dp would be n * 4π (1/p^4) * (dp/dp) → so dN/dp = 4π n / p^4.

Wait, wait. No, because dN is the number in a shell, and I
