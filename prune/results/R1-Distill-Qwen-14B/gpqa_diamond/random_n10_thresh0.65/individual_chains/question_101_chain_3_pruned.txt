Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again. 

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic secondary amine. So, when amines react under certain conditions, they can form various products like imines, enamines, or maybe undergo some kind of condensation.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me try to draw the structure mentally. The pyrrolidine ring (five-membered with one nitrogen) has a methyl group at position 3. Now, the substituent at position 1 is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. So, that's a cyclohexane ring attached via a methylene group (CH₂) and the cyclohexane has a double bond, making it a cyclohexenyl group. So, the structure is like the pyrrolidine has a CH₂ connected to a cyclohexene.

Wait, the cyclohexene part is attached to the methyl group. So, the structure would be something like pyrrolidine with a substituent that's a methylene (CH₂) connected to a cyclohexene ring. So, it's an annulated structure maybe, or perhaps a more straightforward addition.

Now, thinking about the reaction conditions. The reaction is acid-catalyzed, so it's probably some kind of acid-mediated reaction between the amine and compound A.

I recall that when an amine reacts with a carbonyl compound under acid catalysis, it can form an imine. But wait, imine formation typically involves a primary amine and a ketone or aldehyde. Also, imine formation usually requires an aqueous acidic condition, but this might not apply here.

Wait, but the product here isn't an imine. Alternatively, maybe it's an enamine. Enamine formation comes to mind. Enamines are usually formed from secondary amines and ketones or aldehydes. Let me think about how that works.

Enamine synthesis typically involves two steps. First, the secondary amine reacts with a ketone
