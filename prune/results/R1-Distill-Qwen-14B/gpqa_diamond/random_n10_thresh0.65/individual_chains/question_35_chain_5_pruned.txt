Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. Alright, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S has a specific form. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, and then determine which statement among the options is correct.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices scaled by some constants. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and they're used for spin-1/2 particles like the muon here.

So, the matrix S here looks familiar. Let me write it out. S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. I think that's similar to the Pauli Y matrix. Oh wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], exactly. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

But wait, the operator A_y is given by c times S. So, A_y = c * Y, where Y is the Pauli Y matrix. And c is h/(4π). I wonder what the eigenvalues of this operator are.

Eigenvalues of Y are ±1, right? Because for Pauli matrices, each has eigenvalues ±1. Wait, let's confirm. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So, for sigma_y, the eigenvalues are indeed ±1.

So, the operator A_y = (h/(4π)) * Y. So, the eigenvalues would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by ±1. So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see an option that directly states that. Let me look at option B. Option B says the imaginary part is ±1/2 and real part ±1. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Option A says imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, but our calculation shows the eigenvalues are real. The eigenvalues are ±(h/(4π)), which is a real number. So, the eigenvalues are real, which would have zero imaginary part.

Wait, that's conflicting. Because
