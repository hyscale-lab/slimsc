Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me jot down what I know.

First, the crystal is rhombohedral. I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal, but those angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, which in a cubic structure would be the edge length a. But in a rhombohedral structure, which is a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or wait, no—rhombohedral is part of the cubic system, right? Because all edges are equal, and the angles can vary but all are the same. So it's a special case of the cubic system.

Wait, I think the rhombohedral system is a type of hexagonal system sometimes, but I'm a bit confused. Oh, no, wait. In the crystal systems, there are seven types. Cubic includes things like simple cubic, BCC, FCC, and rhombohedral (which is sometimes called trigonal when all edges are equal but angles aren't 90). Or maybe I'm mixing that up. But the important thing here is that for a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is a = b = c, but the angles α=β=γ, which in this case is 30 degrees.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the Bragg's law equation, but more directly, the formula for d is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk\cos\alpha + 2hl\cos\beta + 2kl\cos\gamma}}}

Wait, but wait a second—is this the correct formula? Or is there another one? Oh, right, for a cubic system, when α=β=γ=90°, the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But when the angles are not 90 degrees, we need to account for the cosines of the angles.

In this case, since the rhombohedral has all angles equal to 30°, α
