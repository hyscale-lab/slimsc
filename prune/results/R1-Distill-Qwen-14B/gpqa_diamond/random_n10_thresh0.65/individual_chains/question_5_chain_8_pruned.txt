Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator P along a certain direction. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction isn't along the standard x, y, or z axes. Since it's in the x-z plane, the direction vector would be something like (a, 0, b), right? And since it's a unit vector, a² + b² = 1. But since I don't know the exact angle, I'll probably have to express the eigenvector in terms of theta or something like that.

The operator P is along this direction n, so I think that means the operator is a combination of the Pauli matrices scaled by components in x, y, z. Wait, the given components are P_x, P_y, P_z, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the general form for an operator along a direction n = (nx, ny, nz) would be P = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, ny would be zero. So, P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvector of this operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, I need to find a vector v such that P v = (ħ/2) v.

Let me write down the matrices for each component. The problem gives:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P is nx P_x + nz P_z, right? Because ny is zero.

So, let me compute that. Let's let nx = a and nz = b, with a² + b² = 1. Then:

P = (a)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (b)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ a[[0,1],[1,0]] + b[[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So, the matrix inside the brackets is:

[ b, a ]
[ a, -b ]

So, P = (ħ/2) * [[b, a], [a, -b]]

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. The a term is from P_x, which is [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by a. So when I add:

a*0 + b*1 for element (1,1) is b.

a*1 + b*0 for element (1,2) is a.

a*1 (since P_x's (2,1) is 1) plus b*0 (since P_z's (2,1) is 0) is a.

And for (2,2), it's a*0 + b*(-1) = -b.

So, yes, the matrix is [[b, a], [a, -b]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the equation P|v> = (ħ/2)|v> becomes:

(ħ/2) [[b, a], [a, -b]] |v> = (ħ/2)|v>

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[[b, a], [a, -b]] |v> = |v>

So, the matrix equation is:

[ b*v1 + a*v2 = v1 ]
[ a*v1 - b*v2 = v2 ]

Wait, let me denote the components of the eigenvector as v = [v1, v2]^T.

So, the equations are:

b v1 + a v2 = v1  --> (b - 1) v1 + a v2 = 0

a v1 - b v2 = v2 --> a v1 + (-b -1) v2 = 0

So, we have two equations:

1. (b - 1) v1 + a v2 = 0
2. a v1 + (-b -1) v2 = 0

We can write this as a homogeneous system. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

The coefficient matrix is:

[ (b-1)   a      ]
[ a      (-b-1) ]

The determinant is: (b-1)(-b-1) - a^2 = 0.

Compute (b-1)(-b -1) = (1 - b)(b + 1) ) Hmmm, wait, let me compute:

(b -1)(-b -1) = -(b)(b +1) + (1)(b +1) ) = -b² -b + b +1 ) = -b² +1.

So, determinant is (-b² + 1) - a² = 0.

But since a² + b² =1 (because direction is unit vector in x-z plane), then:

- b² +1 - a² = 0 → (because a² + b² =1 → 1 = a² + b² → -b² +1 = a² )

So, determinant is a² - a² = 0. So the equations are consistent, and we can find the eigenvectors.

Now, from the first equation: (b-1) v1 + a v2 =0 → a v2 = (1 - b) v1 → v2 = [(1 - b)/a ] v1, assuming a ≠0.

But wait, if a is zero, then the direction is along z-axis. But in that case, the problem would have a different solution. But let's proceed assuming a ≠0.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [v1, v2] = [v1, ((1-b)/a) v1 ] = v1 [1, (1 - b)/a ]

We can choose v1 = a to make it simpler, then v2 = (1 -b).

So, the vector is [a, 1 - b]^T.

But wait, I should normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |1 - b|^2 =1.

Wait, but a and b are real numbers because the direction is in x-z plane. So, yes, they are real, so a^2 + (1 - b)^2 =1.

Wait, but a^2 + b^2 =1 because it's a unit vector. So, substituting a² =1 - b².

So, let's compute the normalization:

a² + (1 - b)^2 = (1 - b²) + (1 - 2b + b²) = (1 - b² +1 -2b + b²) = 2 - 2b.

But this must equal 1 because the vector is normalized. So:

2 - 2b =1 → 2b =1 → b=1/2.

Wait, but wait, this is a problem because if a² + (1 -b)^2 =1, but a² + b^2=1.

Wait, wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in assuming the vector is [a, 1 -b]. That's correct based on the equation, but the normalization leads to a condition that's only possible for certain a and b.

Wait, but a and b are variables that define the direction, so perhaps the problem is that the vector I found is not normalized unless 2 - 2b =1, which gives b=0.5. Hmm, that's an issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the eigenvalue problem again.

The operator P has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, and here P is a combination scaled by ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is:

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Which gives the matrix equation as before.

Alternatively, since the Pauli matrices are in the x, y, z directions, the operator P is proportional to a Pauli matrix in the direction n. So, the eigenstates would be the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices along an arbitrary direction (nx, ny, nz) are given by:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

and

|-> = [ -i e^{i phi} sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T

Wait, but because the direction is in the x-z plane, phi would be zero because it's in the x-z plane. Oh, right, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle phi is zero. So the eigenstate
