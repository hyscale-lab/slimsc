Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think it through.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I'll need to figure out what each step does. Let's start with step one: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. Since it's an adamantane derivative, the structure is quite rigid. So, heating with KOH likely leads to the formation of an alkene via an E2 mechanism. 

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. Eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if it's a diamondoid, the positions might not be adjacent. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure. Adamantane has a structure similar to four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two opposite positions. Wait, but for elimination to form a double bond, the two Brs must be on adjacent carbons. Maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a transannular elimination. Oh wait, perhaps it's a bridge structure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is such that elimination forms a cyclohexene ring within the adamantane structure. I'm a bit confused here, but let's proceed.

The product after KOH is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a deshielded region, possibly an -OH group? Or maybe an -O- group. But wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbony
