Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Out of these, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So, the system involves charges, so I think I need to calculate the electric potential energy between them. Because potential energy depends on the arrangement of charges, right? Since the system is isolated, the potential energy will contribute to the total energy.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So I need to think about the configuration that would give the lowest possible potential energy. Because in systems of charges, when you have like charges, they tend to repel each other. But in this case, all charges are the same (2e each), so they all repel each other. But how does that affect the potential energy?

Wait, potential energy is minimized when the repulsion is as much as possible, or when the energy is as low as possible. Hmm. Or wait, potential energy is lowest when the charges are as far apart as possible. Because when they are closer, the potential energy increases. Wait, no, for like charges, the potential energy is positive and increases as they get closer. So to minimize the potential energy, you want to maximize the distances between the charges as much as possible.

Wait, but in this setup, 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from point P. And the 13th is at P. So the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. But wait, are the 12 charges all at point P? No, because the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 are at 2m from P.

Wait, but how are the 12 arranged? Are they all on the same point, or spread out around P? If they're constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, they might be arranged in some symmetric way, like on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters. But for potential energy, the exact arrangement might matter because the potential between each pair depends on their separation.

Wait, but the problem might be simplifying this. Let's think. Each of the 12 charges is
