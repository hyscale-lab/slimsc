Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, LTE is assumed, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. That means the distribution of atoms in energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann distribution.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the problem states that in star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. So if I consider the ratio n1 / n2, it's 2:1? Wait, no, because I think the ratio is for the same energy level in each star. Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the specific energy level's excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio of the populations is 2:1 for the same energy level? Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of excited atoms to the ground state. Hmm.

Wait, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Oh, maybe it
