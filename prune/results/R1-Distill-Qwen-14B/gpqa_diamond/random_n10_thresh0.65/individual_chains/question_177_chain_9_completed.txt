Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it again and try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key points given are:

1. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2.
2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, M1 = 1.5 * M2.
3. The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. That probably means they have the same effective temperature because the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So, same λ_max implies same T.
4. Radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is about their movement towards or away from us. But for luminosity, which depends on intrinsic properties, does radial velocity matter? Hmm. I'm not sure yet; maybe it's a red herring or perhaps it's used in calculating something else. But the main thing about luminosity for black bodies is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which depends on radius and temperature.

So, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So, factor = L1 / L2.

The formula for luminosity of a star (as a black body) is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Now, since both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures T must be equal. So, T1 = T2 = T. Therefore, when we take the ratio L1/L2, the T terms will cancel out.

Let me write that down:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) ) 

Since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1/R2)².

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squared is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So, L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, that's only considering R and T. 

Wait a second. What about the radial velocities? The problem states that Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. But how does that affect luminosity? I thought that luminosity is an intrinsic property, but maybe the observed flux is affected by velocity. Oh, but the question is about computed luminosity, not observed flux. Because in the question, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2, so it's about their actual luminosities, not the light we receive.

So, radial velocity shouldn't affect the intrinsic luminosity. So, maybe the radial velocity part is a distractor. So, I can ignore the radial velocities for calculating luminosity.

Wait, but wait another thought. If the stars are moving, does that affect their observed temperature via Doppler shift? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, it causes a Doppler shift in its emitted light. So, the observed wavelength would change. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, maybe that's the observed wavelength, which could be different from the intrinsic wavelength due to Doppler shift.

But in the problem, the wavelengths are the same. So, perhaps the Doppler shift has adjusted the observed peak wavelength to be the same. So, let me think about this.

If the stars have intrinsic temperatures T1 and T2, but due to their velocities, their observed temperatures (from our perspective) would be different. But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So, let me model this.

The Doppler shift formula is: observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards). Wait, I might have the sign wrong. Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

λ_obs = λ_0 * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. For a source moving away, z is positive, so λ_obs > λ_0. For a source moving towards us, z is negative, so λ_obs < λ_0.

But another way to write the Doppler shift when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

1 + z = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) 

Wait, no, I think the exact formula depends on whether it's the relativistic Doppler effect. Since the velocities here are a significant fraction of the speed of light (700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light, c ≈ 3e5 km/s), so relativistic effects might be negligible. So, maybe we can approximate using the non-relativistic Doppler formula.

Non-relativistic approximation for Doppler shift for radial velocity:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, for a star moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs increases (redshift). For a star moving towards us, v_r is negative, so λ_obs decreases (blueshift).

But in this problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Let me denote Star_1 as having v_r = 0, so no Doppler shift. Therefore, the observed λ_max for Star_1 is the same as its intrinsic λ_max, which is b / T1.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so v_r is positive. Therefore, its observed λ_max would be longer (redshifted) compared to its intrinsic λ_max. But the observed λ_max for Star_2 is same as Star_1's observed λ_max. So:

λ_obs, Star1 = λ_rest, Star1 = b / T1
λ_obs, Star2 = λ_rest, Star2 * (1 + v_r2 / c ) = b / T2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But since λ_obs, Star1 = λ_obs, Star2, we have:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

We can cancel b from both sides:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Rearranging:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, but we also know that Star_1 has a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2. But how does that tie in? Oh, wait, because the effective temperature of a star is related to its mass and radius. For main-sequence stars, more massive stars are hotter and more luminous. But I'm not sure about the exact relation here. Alternatively, perhaps we can link the mass and radius into the calculation of temperature.

Wait, but the question says that the stars are treated as black bodies. So, perhaps the only thing that determines the luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T⁴, and the given data. But we might have to find T1 and T2 using the Doppler shift.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the observed λ_max is same for both stars, so:

λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But λ_obs1 is λ_rest1, since Star_1 isn't moving. So:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ_rest is related to T by Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T. So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Simplify: 1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but this would mean that if Star_2 is moving away (v_r2 positive), its observed wavelength is longer, but if Star_1's observed wavelength is the same as Star_2's, then T1 must be less than T2? Because T1 = T2 / (something greater than 1).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because Star_1 is more massive. More massive stars are generally hotter. So, if T1 is less than T2, that would contradict. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the Doppler shift formula.

Wait, maybe I should consider the Doppler effect formula correctly. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) )

Wait, no, that's the relativistic version. Alternatively, the approximate formula for small velocities is Δλ/λ ≈ v_r / c. But when v_r is positive (moving away), λ_obs increases.

Wait, maybe I should model this correctly. Let's denote the rest wavelength as λ_rest, and the observed wavelength as λ_obs. For a source moving away with velocity v_r (positive), the observed wavelength is longer. So:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, this is an approximation for small v_r/c.

In this problem, v_r for Star_2 is 700 km/s. Let's check what fraction of c that is.

c ≈ 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = approx 0.002333, so about 0.233% of c. So, non-relativistic approximation should be okay.

So, for Star_2, λ_obs = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

We know that λ_obs for both stars is the same.

Star_1 has λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (since v_r1=0).

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But λ_rest is related to T by λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, that would mean T1 is less than T2 if v_r2 is positive. But that contradicts the fact that Star_1 is more massive, which for main-sequence stars implies higher temperature.

Hmm, maybe I got the sign wrong. Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us instead of away. If v_r2 is negative (since moving towards), then (1 + v_r2/c) would be less than 1. Let me plug in v_r2 = -700 km/s.

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + (-700)/c )

Which would make λ_obs2 shorter than λ_rest2, i.e., blueshifted.

Then,

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 - 700/c )

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 - 700/c )

Which would imply T1 = T2 / (1 - 700/c )

But 700/c is small, so denominator is not too small. Let me compute it numerically.

Compute 700 / (3e5) = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333...

So,

1 - 0.002333 ≈ 0.9976667.

Thus,

T1 = T2 / 0.9976667 ≈ T2 * 1.002333.

So, T1 is approximately 0.23% higher than T2.

Wait, but wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then its observed λ_max would be blueshifted, meaning higher temperature. But according to the problem, both observed λ_max are the same. So, perhaps that's the case.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's say Star_1 is stationary, and Star_2 is moving towards us with velocity v_r2 = 700 km/s. Star_1's λ_max (observed) is λ1 = b / T1. Star_2's intrinsic λ_max is λ2_rest = b / T2.

But due to movement towards us, Star_2's observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c ), but wait, if v_r is towards us, is it positive or negative? Oh, I think in the formula, v_r is positive when moving away. So when moving towards, v_r is negative.

So, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c ) where v_r is positive if moving away, negative if moving towards.

So in Star_2's case, v_r2 = -700 km/s.

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + (-700)/c ) ≈ λ_rest2 * (1 - 0.002333)

And since λ_obs2 must equal λ_obs1,

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 - 0.002333 )

Which gives,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.997667

But λ_rest is b/T, so,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 0.997667

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * 0.997667

=> T1 = T2 / 0.997667 ≈ T2 * 1.002333

So, T1 is approximately 0.233% higher than T2.

So, T1 ≈ 1.002333 * T2

Now, using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity,

L = 4π R² σ T^4

So, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2 )^2 σ (T2 * 1.002333 )^4

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4

So, the ratio L1/L2 is:

[(1.5 R2)^2 (T2 * 1.002333)^4 ] / [ R2^2 T2^4 ]

The R2^2 and T2^4 cancel out,

= (1.5)^2 * (1.002333)^4

Compute each term:

1.5^2 = 2.25

(1.002333)^4: Let's calculate it.

Let me compute (1+x)^4 where x=0.002333.

Approximately, using binomial expansion:

(1+x)^4 ≈ 1 +4x +6x² +4x³ +x^4.

But since x is very small, x² and higher terms are negligible.

So, 4x = 4 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.009332.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 0.009332 = ~1.009332.

So, approximately 1.00933.

So, the ratio becomes:

2.25 * 1.00933 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00933

Let me compute 2.25 * 1.00933.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25

2.25 * 0.00933 ≈ 2.25 * 0.009 ≈ 0.02025, and 0.00033 *2.25=0.0007425. So total ≈ 0.02025 + 0.0007425 ≈ 0.0209925.

So, 2.25 + 0.0209925 ≈ 2.2709925.

So, approximately 2.27. But wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 1.002333 is approximately 1.002333333.

Let me compute (1.002333)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute step by step:

First, compute (1.002333)^2:

= 1.002333 *1.002333

= approximately 1 + (0.002333 *2) + (0.002333)^2.

= 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544 (since (0.002333)^2 ≈ 5.44e-6)

≈ 1.00467144.

Then, square that to get (1.00467144)^2.

(1.00467144)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2

= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182

≈ 1.0093647.

So, the fourth power is approximately 1.009365.

So, 2.25 * 1.009365 ≈ ?

Let's compute 2.25 * 1.009365:

Break it down:

2.25 * 1 = 2.25

2.25 * 0.009365 = ?

0.009365 * 2 = 0.01873.

0.009365 * 0.25 = 0.00234125.

Adding them together: 0.01873 + 0.00234125 = 0.02107125.

So, total is 2.25 + 0.02107125 = 2.27107125.

So, approximately 2.271. So the factor is about 2.27.

Looking at the options, option C is ~2.35, option D is ~2.23, option B is ~2.32, and option A is ~2.25.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because when you have a moving star, the observed flux also changes due to the Doppler effect. Or does it not affect the intrinsic luminosity?

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but their luminosity is an intrinsic property. Hmm, but in the problem, the observed λ_max is the same. So, the effective temperatures would be different if considering their actual velocities, but since the observed λ_max is same, perhaps their effective temperatures as observed are same? Or no.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap.

The problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelengths. So, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So, their observed temperatures are the same. Because T is inversely proportional to λ_max.

But their intrinsic temperatures might be different because of the Doppler shift. So, if I compute luminosity based on their intrinsic properties, which are their actual R and T, then the calculation would be different.

Wait, but in the problem, the astronomers computed the luminosity using black body radiation. So, they would use the star's actual (intrinsic) radius and temperature, not the observed ones.

Alternatively, perhaps when considering the Doppler effect, the observed flux F is related to the intrinsic luminosity L via F = L / (4π d²) * (1 + v_r / c )^2, or something like that. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the flux we receive is F = L / (4π d²) * (1 + v_r/c )^2. Is that correct? Or is it different?

Wait, no, I think that the flux is affected by the Doppler shift in a way that if a star is moving towards us, the flux increases due to the blueshift.

Wait, but in reality, the flux (energy per unit area per unit time) depends on the star's luminosity and the distance, but also on the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect can cause a shift in wavelength, which affects the observed flux because the photons are compressed (blueshifted) or stretched (redshifted). So, the observed flux F is:

F = F0 * (1 + v_r/c )^2,

where F0 is the flux without any Doppler shift.

Wait, I'm not entirely certain about this formula. Let me think about it.

The flux is power per unit area. The power is energy per time. The Doppler effect affects the frequency of the photons, which in turn affects the energy of each photon. Additionally, the number of photons per second received may change due to the relativistic effects.

Alternatively, the observed flux F can be expressed as:

F = F0 * ( (1 + v_r/c ) / sqrt(1 - v_r²/c²) ) )

But for non-relativistic speeds, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1, so F ≈ F0 (1 + v_r/c )

But F0 is L/(4π d²), so F = (L/(4π d²)) * (1 + v_r/c )

But wait, in this problem, the question is about the luminosity computed by the astronomers. So, they would calculate L based on the observed flux and the distance, but with the Doppler effect. Hmm, but in the problem statement, I don't think the distance is given. So perhaps this is not the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the astronomers compute the luminosity from the star's properties as black bodies, using their observed characteristics.

Wait, the problem says that the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies, and the luminosity is computed based on that. The problem gives that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, they use the observed λ_max to infer the temperature.

But in reality, the observed λ_max is different from the intrinsic λ_max due to their velocity. So, the astronomers would calculate their effective temperatures based on the observed λ_max, which is the same for both stars. So, they would compute T1_obs and T2_obs as the same.

But their actual temperatures, T1 and T2, may be different because of their velocities.

So, let me think about this again, considering that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars.

Star_1: v_r1 = 0, so observed λ_max1 = intrinsic λ_max1. So, T1_obs = T1.

Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s (moving away), so observed λ_max2 = λ_max2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c ). Since λ_max1_obs = λ_max2_obs,

λ_max1_rest = λ_max2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

But λ_max_rest = b / T_rest.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b,

1 / T1 = (1 / T2 ) * (1 + v_r2/c )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

But in that case, since v_r2 is moving away (positive), the denominator is larger than 1, so T1 is smaller than T2.

But wait, that contradicts the fact that Star_1 is more massive, which in main-sequence stars would imply higher temperature. So, if T1 < T2, that's conflicting.

Hmm. That seems problematic. So, maybe Star_2 is moving towards us, so v_r2 is negative, which would make 1 + v_r2/c less than 1, but positive.

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

If v_r2 is negative (moving towards us), then (1 + v_r2/c ) is less than 1, so T1 would be larger than T2.

Which makes sense, because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max is smaller than its intrinsic λ_max, but since the observed λ_max is same as Star_1, which is stationary, T1 would be higher than T2.

But earlier when I assumed Star_2 was moving towards us, I found that T1 ≈ T2 * 1.002333, but that was when considering the observed λ_max as same.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting myself confused. Let me model this with actual numbers.

Suppose Star_1 has T1 = T, and is stationary. So, its observed λ_max is λ1 = b / T.

Star_2 has intrinsic temperature T2. But because it's moving with velocity v_r2, its observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c ).

Given that λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But,

λ1 = b / T1 = b / T,

λ2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

=> T = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T2 = T * (1 + v_r2/c )

But if Star_2 is moving towards us, v_r2 is negative, so (1 + v_r2/c ) is less than 1.

So,

T2 = T * (1 + (-700e3)/(3e5) ) 

Wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. c is 3e5,000 m/s.

Wait, 700e3 / 3e5 = 700e3 / 3e5 = (700 /300 ) * (1e3 / 1e3) ) = 700/300 = 2.333...e-1? Wait,

Wait, 700,000 m/s divided by 300,000,000 m/s.

700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.002333.

So,

v_r2 = -700,000 m/s,

so,

(1 + v_r2/c ) = 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667.

Thus,

T2 = T * 0.997667.

Wait, that would make T2 less than T, which implies that Star_2 has a lower temperature than Star_1, which makes sense because Star_1 is more massive and hence hotter.

So, T1 = T,

T2 = T * 0.997667.

So, T1 = T,

T2 = T * 0.997667.

Now, we can compute the luminosity ratio.

L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So,

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2 )^2 σ T^4,

L2 =4π R2^2 σ (T2 )^4.

So,

L1 / L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )^2 T^4 ) / ( R2^2 (T2)^4 )

= (2.25) * ( T^4 / (T2)^4 )

But T2 = T * 0.997667.

So,

T^4 / (T2)^4 = 1 / (0.997667)^4.

Compute (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute 0.997667^2 first.

0.997667 * 0.997667 ≈ (1 - 0.002333)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 0.99533944.

Then, square that to get the fourth power.

(0.99533944)^2 = (approx 1 - 2*0.00466056 + ... )

But perhaps numerically:

0.99533944 * 0.99533944 ≈ Let me compute:

≈ (1 - 0.00466056)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00466056 + (0.00466056)^2.

= 1 - 0.00932112 + 0.00002172.

= 0.9906786.

So, 1/(0.997667)^4 ≈ 1 / 0.9906786 ≈ 1.0094.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.272.

So, approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.23, but wait, let me check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (0.997667)^4.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute (0.997667)^4.

First, compute (0.997667)^2:

= 0.997667 * 0.997667.

Let me compute 0.997667 * 0.997667.

0.997667 * 0.997667:

= (1 - 0.002333) * (1 - 0.002333)
= 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2
= 1 - 0.004666 + 0.00000544
= 0.99533944.

Then, compute (0.99533944)^2.

= (0.99533944) * (0.99533944)

= (1 - 0.00466056) * (1 - 0.00466056)
= 1 - 2*0.00466056 + (0.00466056)^2
≈ 1 - 0.00932112 + 0.00002172
= 0.9906786.

So, (0.997667)^4 = 0.9906786.

So, 1/(0.9906786) ≈ 1.0094.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.272.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.23, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.002333)^4 more accurately.

Wait, earlier I computed (1.002333)^4 as approximately 1.009365, leading to 2.25 * 1.009365 ≈ 2.271.

But perhaps the exact calculation would be a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate T2 in terms of T1, then plug into the L formula.

Wait, another approach: Because the observed λ_max is the same, and considering the Doppler shift, what's the relation between the intrinsic temperatures?

But I think I'm getting stuck in a loop here. Let me think if I can find another way.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But what is T1/T2?

From earlier, we have T1 = T2 * (1 + v_r2/c ) / (1 + v_r1/c )

But v_r1 is 0, so T1 = T2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, no, that was the earlier equation:

From 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c ), so T1 = T2 / (1 +v_r2/c )

Wait, when v_r2 is negative (moving towards us), 1 + v_r2/c is less than 1, so T1 is larger than T2.

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + (v_r2/c) )

v_r2 is 700 km/s, moving away? No, earlier we thought it was moving towards us, but the question says Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s, but doesn't specify direction. Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Radial velocity is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards. So, if Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s, that would mean moving away at 700 km/s.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the radial velocities earlier. The problem says Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. So, it's moving away from us.

Wait, that's a crucial point.

So, if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then v_r2 is +700 km/s.

So, the observed λ_max2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Since λ_obs2 = λ_obs1 = λ_rest1,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

=> (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

v_r2 = +700 km/s.

Thus, 1 + v_r2/c = 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So, T1 is lower than T2. But that contradicts the fact that Star_1 has higher mass, which would make it hotter.

So, this leads to a contradiction because more massive stars are hotter.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't assuming main-sequence stars. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we have to proceed regardless.

So, if T1 = T2 * 0.99767,

Then,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2 )^2 * (T1 / T2 )^4.

R1/R2 = 1.5.

T1/T2 = 0.99767.

So,

(1.5)^2 = 2.25,

(0.99767)^4.

Compute (0.99767)^4:

As earlier,

(0.99767)^2 = approx 0.99534,

Then, (0.99534)^2 = approx 0.99068.

So,

(0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.99068.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99068 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99068 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So, the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\), so \(\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5\).
2. **Mass**: \(M_1 = 1.5 M_2\), but mass does not directly affect luminosity in this calculation.
3. **Observed Wavelengths**: The stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, implying their observed temperatures \(T_{\text{obs},1}\) and \(T_{\text{obs},2}\) are the same.
4. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has \(v_r = 0\), and Star_2 has \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) (moving away). The Doppler effect shifts the observed wavelength of Star_2.

### Step 1: Relating Intrinsic and Observed Temperatures
The observed wavelength is related to the intrinsic wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
\]

For blackbody radiation, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature (\(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\)). Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars:

\[
\frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}} = \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{1 + v_r/c}{1}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
T_1 = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + v_r/c}
\]

Substituting \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
T_1 = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + 700/300,000} = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx T_2 \cdot 0.997667
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.997667
\]

### Step 2: Compute the Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

Substitute \(\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5\) and \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.997667\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.997667)^4
\]

1. Compute \((1.5)^2 = 2.25\).
2. Compute \((0.997667)^4\):
   - First, \((0.997667)^2 \approx 0.995339\).
   - Then, \((0.995339)^2 \approx 0.990678\).

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.990678 \approx 2.227
\]

### Step 3: Match with Options
The closest option to \(2.227\) is:

**D) ~2.23**

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{D}}
\]
