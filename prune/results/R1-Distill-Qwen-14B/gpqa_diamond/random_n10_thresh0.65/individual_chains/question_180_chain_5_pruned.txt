Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. I remember that e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 2 * 1.602e-19 C, which is 3.204e-19 C.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

I think I need to calculate the potential energy of the system. Potential energy in electrostatics for point charges is given by the formula U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

Wait, but since there are multiple charges, I should consider all pairs. Oh right, because each charge interacts with every other charge. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, but in this setup, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge. Also, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but what about their distances from each other?

Hmm, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. I'm assuming they're all fixed on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. But their mutual distances from each other would vary, but perhaps for potential energy, since they're symmetrically placed, maybe it's easier to compute.

Wait, no, the potential energy comes from all the interactions between all pairs. So the total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs of (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

But in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 charges are all at r=2 m from P. So the distance from each of the 12 charges to the fixed charge is 2 meters
