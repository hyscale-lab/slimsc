Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again and think about what I know.

The question says: Two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE * τ ≈ ħ, where τ is the lifetime. I might have to double-check the exact formula, but I think it's something like that.

So, the idea is that the uncertainty in energy ΔE is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy is known, meaning a smaller ΔE. But in this question, we have two states with different lifetimes, and we need the energy difference between them to be resolvable.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So each state has an uncertainty ΔE1 and ΔE2. How does that help? Oh, wait, no, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So, the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, I suppose. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty is the smallest possible, so that the energy difference is more than that.

Let me think. Each state's energy is not precisely known; there's an uncertainty. For E1, the lifetime is τ1 = 1e-9 sec. So the uncertainty in E1 would be ΔE1 = ħ / (τ1). Similarly, for E2, the uncertainty would be ΔE2 = ħ / (τ2).

So, the energy difference between E1 and E2, ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For us to distinguish between the two, this ΔE must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Wait, wait, no. Because each energy has an uncertainty, so the real energy of E1 is in E1 ± ΔE1, and E2 is in E2 ± ΔE2. So, the energy difference between the two should be such that the intervals don't overlap. Otherwise, we can't tell them apart.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal detectable ΔE is determined by the uncertainty in the measurement. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach it step by step.

First, calculate the uncertainty in each energy. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J.

But wait, the options are in eV. Let me convert that to eV. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So,

ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 6.58e-7 eV. Hmm, that's about 0.000000658 eV.

For E2, τ2 is 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1e-26 J? Wait, no, using the exact ħ value:

ΔE2 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Convert to eV:

1.0545718e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, the question is about the energy difference ΔE. To distinguish the two states, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps, the minimal detectable ΔE is the sum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps not. Because when you have two states, the energy difference between them must be greater than the combined uncertainty so that the two energy levels don't overlap in their uncertainty intervals.

But wait, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. So, for E1, the energy is in [E1 - ΔE1, E1 + ΔE1]. For E2, [E2 - ΔE2, E2 + ΔE2].

The energy difference would be ΔE = E2 - E1. We want ΔE to be such that even taking into account the uncertainties, E1's upper boundary is less than E2's lower boundary. So, E1 + ΔE1 < E2 - ΔE2. That would ensure that the two intervals don't overlap, so we can definitely tell them apart.

So, rearranging, E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Which means, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but if the energy difference is exactly the sum, then the edges just meet, but that might not be enough for clear distinction. So perhaps the minimal ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Earlier calculations:

ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV,

ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Adding them: 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = approx 7.24e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference ΔE
