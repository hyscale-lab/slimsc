Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, okay, I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means their density is the same throughout space in this scenario. And the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself.

Wait, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. Oh right, so parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So, the number of stars in a given range of parallax. Let's think in terms of volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, their number density is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume.

Parallax ranges... So, for a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, we need to find the corresponding distance range and the volume. Wait, wait. Parallax decreases as distance increases. So, if plx is small, the star is far away. If plx is large, it's nearby.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume is constant because they're uniformly distributed. So I need to find how much volume corresponds to a certain change in parallax. Let me think about that.

Parallax is 1/d. So, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, when plx increases, d decreases. So, for a small change in plx, how does that translate to a change in d?

Let me think about differentials. If plx changes by dplx, then d changes by dd. Since d = 1/plx, taking derivative: dd = - (1/plx²) dplx → dplx = - (plx²) dd. So, the change in plx is proportional to plx squared times the change in d. But since we're dealing with ranges, the sign doesn't matter, just the magnitude.

Now, the volume between two spheres of radius d and d + dd. The volume is (4/3)π (d + dd)^3 - (4/3)π d^3 ≈ 4π d² dd. Because when you expand (d+dd)^3, the leading terms are d^3 +
