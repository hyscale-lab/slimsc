Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Additionally, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is close to 277 K. 

Another clue is that when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry, which gives me a hint about its identity.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in substance X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, let's start by figuring out what substance X could be. Since X reacts with liquid Y and forms a precipitate, perhaps it's a metal reacting with a solution that contains ions, leading to a precipitation reaction. Also, the reaction releases a gas. 

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. That suggests it's a noble gas because noble gases are monoatomic and have a specific number of electrons, which equals their atomic number, which in turn relates to protons and neutrons. Wait, but the number of neutrons equals the number of protons for W. So, the atomic number (protons) equals the number of neutrons. So the isotope would have protons = neutrons. Let me think about possible noble gases.

Noble gases have atomic numbers like 2, 10, 18, etc. Let's look for an isotope where protons = neutrons. For He (Z=2), that's 2 neutrons. So the isotope would be ^4He. For Ne (Z=10), that would be ^20Ne (10 protons, 10 neutrons). Argon (Z=18) would be ^36Ar. So the gas W could be any of these, but the most common would be He or Ne, maybe?

Wait, but if W is released during the reaction between X and Y, what kind of reaction would produce a noble gas? Maybe a reaction where a carbonate or bicarbonate reacts with an acid, releasing CO2, but that's a gas but not a noble gas. Or perhaps if Y is a solution of something that when reacts with X, produces a noble gas
