Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativistic energy and colliders. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question is asking for the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. Got it.

Now, I remember that in particle physics, when calculating the energy of a moving particle, we use the relativistic energy formula. The energy E is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, E=γmc². But wait, the problem might be in natural units where c=1, so the calculations might be simpler. But let me think carefully.

Wait, but I need to compute the total energy of the nucleus. So first, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for 6 nucleons, the rest mass energy would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me calculate that: 6 * 938 is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. So m = 5.628 GeV/c².

The speed is given as 0.96c. So I need to find gamma (γ) for this speed. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Plugging in v=0.96c, let's compute that.

So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Wait, let me check that more precisely. Let me compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.
