Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. Hmm, alright.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, I think this is a nucleophilic substitution or addition maybe. Oh wait, butanone is a ketone, so maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Where does the CN- attack? In a ketone, the carbonyl group is electrophilic, so the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. After that, the oxygen would have a negative charge, which would probably get protonated.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide, the mechanism is probably similar to that of an acid-catalyzed addition. So, the ketone might first get protonated to make the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right, the cyanohydrin formation! So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent.

So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw this out. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh, but wait, the product is 2-h
