Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent and forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is the calcium-yttrate complex. The formation constant K is a measure of the stability of the complex. A high K means the complex is very stable, which implies that the concentration of free calcium ions should be really low because most of the calcium is tied up in the complex.

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Now, I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

I think the formation of the complex can be represented by the equation: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, since the complex is in solution, most of the EDTA would be in the form of the complex. But wait, the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, right?

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let's think about the initial concentrations. The solution contains the complex, so initially, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, some of it will break down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, if the complex is stable, the dissociation won't be much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

Let me set up the equation. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So, assuming that the change is small, the concentration of Ca²+ is x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- is also x. The concentration of the complex will be 0.02 - x, but because x is so small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02/(x * x) = 0.02/(x
