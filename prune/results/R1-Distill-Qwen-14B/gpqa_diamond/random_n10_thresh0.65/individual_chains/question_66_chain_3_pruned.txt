Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A to D, each listing different combinations.

First, I need to recall what each of these symmetries means and whether they are enforced in SMEFT.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry. I know that Lorentz symmetry is the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. In the Standard Model (SM), all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. Since SMEFT is an extension that keeps the SM as a subset, Iâ€™d expect that all operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, meaning it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. Wait, but in the SMEFT framework, the operators are classified by their Lorentz and other quantum numbers. Do they have to respect Poincare symmetry? Well, the effective theory is built in a way that respects the symmetries of the underlying SM. The SM respects Poincare, so I think SMEFT must too. But wait, aren't the operators in SMEFT classified in terms of their Lorentz indices, implying that they transform correctly under Lorentz but maybe not necessarily Poincare? Or does the fact that they are built as local operators imply they respect Poincare? Hmm. I'm a bit shaky on this. Let me think again. Poincare includes translations. The operators are local, so they should commute with translations, right? Because if you translate your coordinates, the physics doesn't change. So operators must be invariant under translations, hence respecting Poincare. So option 2 (Poincare) is also a symmetry that must be respected.

Wait, but I've also heard that in SMEFT, the field theory is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory. Since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it's automatically Poincare-invariant? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, no, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, but Lorentz
