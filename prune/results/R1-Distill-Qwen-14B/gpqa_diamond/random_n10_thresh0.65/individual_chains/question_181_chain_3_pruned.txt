Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces a lot of neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, and different reactions produce neutrinos with different energies. The question is about the pp-III branch suddenly stopping, and how that affects the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands.

Wait, the pp chain... I think the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I, II, and III branchesâ€”I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I recall that pp-III involves higher energies because it's about the triple-alpha process or something else? Or maybe it's about the specific reactions within the proton-proton chain. Oh wait, no, the triple-alpha is part of helium burning in the core. So the pp chain has different branches. 

Wait, the proton-proton chain has two main branches. The pp-I branch produces boron-8 via the fusion of two protons, and then that decays into beryllium-7, which captures a proton to become carbon-12. The pp-II branch is another pathway, maybe involving more steps. But the question specifies the pp-III branch stopped. Oh, wait, perhaps that's a typo or misunderstanding. Because I'm not too familiar with a pp-III branch. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the CNO cycle? No, that's a different process altogether. Or maybe it's a different part of the proton-proton chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III refers to a specific part of the chain that produces higher-energy neutrinos. Because I know that the dominant neutrino production in the Sun comes from the pp chain reactions, particularly the decay of beryllium-7 into
