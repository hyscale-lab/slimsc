Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to break it down.

First, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m, moving at 0.6c, and the other is 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting velocities, right? I remember that you can't just do v = u - v' in relativity because you have to use the velocity addition formula. So the relative speed isn't simply 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. No, that's the classical approach. The correct way is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in one dimension is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Let me make sure I remember that correctly. Oh wait, u is the velocity of one object as seen from the other's frame. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B's velocity is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/c²
