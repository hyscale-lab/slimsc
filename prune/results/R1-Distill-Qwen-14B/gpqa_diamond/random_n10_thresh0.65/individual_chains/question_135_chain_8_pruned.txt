Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λ_f f(y) [ψ_f(y)]^† (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that better. Oh, right, it's probably written as L = -λ f ψ_f† (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Or wait, maybe it's L = -λ f bar{ψ} f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I'm a bit confused by the typesetting, but I think it's a Yukawa-like interaction term.

So the mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options give various possible decay channels.

I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. So for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if the combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but what fermions are we talking about here? The interaction term includes fermion fields, so the boson X can couple to those fermions. So the Lagrangian term would be something like X ψ ψ, which means X can decay into ψ and ψ.

The fermions available depend on the model. In the Standard Model, particles like the Higgs can decay into fermions, but their decay products are limited by their masses. Since X is a boson with a mass of 6 GeV, which is about 6,000 MeV.

Let me list the masses of the fermions in the Standard Model:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
- Electron
