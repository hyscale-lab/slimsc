Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let's try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about that affecting anything. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so no issues there either. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Wait, what's K_Ca-EDTA? Oh right, that's the formation constant for the complex ion Ca-EDTA. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex, right? So in this case, a K of 5e10 is quite large, implying that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution. Because the Ca-EDTA complex is formed, the free calcium ions would be at a very low concentration because the complex is stable and doesn't release much Ca²+.

I remember that for such complexes, the formation reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]).

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that's the concentration of the complex. So initially, we can think that [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. But because the complex doesn't dissociate much, [Ca²+] and [EDTA⁴−] would be very low.

So the key equation is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−])

But wait, I think EDTA is a hexadentate ligand. No, wait, in the complex CaEDTA²−, EDTA is usually in the form of H4Y. But under certain pH conditions, it's deprotonated. Since the pH is ideal, I can assume that EDTA is in its Y⁴− form, which is the one that forms the complex with Ca²+.

So in the solution, the only significant species is the complex, and any free Ca²+ and Y⁴−. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and the only other species are the dissociated forms, but they're negligible.

Wait, but we need to find [Ca²+], and since Kf is very large, [Ca²+] should be really small. So the approximation is that [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 M.

But wait, how about the concentration of EDTA? Because for every Ca²+ that dissociates, one EDTA is released. So, if the complex dissociates a little, let's say x is the concentration of Ca²+ in solution, then [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA⁴−] = x as well, because for each mole of Ca²+ that dissociates, one mole of EDTA is released.

So
