Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and a photon causing a transition. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to walk through it step by step.

The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is sometimes called the non-rigid rotor model. So this molecule has atoms X and Y, with their masses given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, causing it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. We need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So if it's in the fundamental state, it's the ground state. Now, when it absorbs a photon, it must transition to the next higher energy state. But wait, which transition are we talking about here? Rotation, vibration, or both?

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state in such a model is usually the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (some J, maybe J=0 or J=1, depending on whether it's rigid or non-rigid). Wait, no, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed. The non-rigid rotor would have a varying bond length, which complicates things because vibration and rotation are coupled. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, the problem says "the quantum rotation
