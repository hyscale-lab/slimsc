Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. Hmm, it says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D with various exponents of 10 in eV.

Wait, so I'm thinking, when it comes to distinguishing energy levels, the key thing is the uncertainty principle, right? Because if the states don't live long enough, their energy measurements aren't precise. So the uncertainty in energy is related to the lifetime of the state. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Let me recall the exact form. Oh right, the uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time should be greater than or equal to ħ/2. But sometimes, people approximate it as ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt) for order-of-magnitude calculations. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by their respective lifetimes.

Wait, but in this problem, the two states have different lifetimes. The first state has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, and the second τ2 = 1e-8 seconds. So their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait a second, the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, I think, because otherwise the two energies could overlap in their uncertainties, making it hard to distinguish them.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty of each. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. When you have two states, each with their own energy uncertainties, to resolve them, the separation between E2 and E1 should be at least as big as the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the uncertainties could overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Or perhaps, wait, maybe each state's energy uncertainty is independent, so the minimum difference should be the sum of the two uncertainties. Let's proceed with that assumption.

So, let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Since ħ = h/(2π), that's about 1.055e-34 J·s. But wait, sometimes for these kinds of problems, people approximate ħ as roughly 1e-34 J·s to make the math easier, or wait, actually, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s, so 1e-34 is a close enough approximation.

So for state 1: τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = ħ/(τ1) ≈ (1e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 1e-25 J. Wait, but the options are in eV. Oh right, I need to convert J to eV.

I remember that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to e
