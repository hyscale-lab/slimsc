Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given data includes the production energy, E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

I remember that the mean decay length of a particle is related to its lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I get the lifetime tau? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is the total decay width, and tau is the mean lifetime. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau, but wait, no, actually, the natural line width is given by Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, no, wait a second. The mean lifetime tau is equal to h-bar divided by the width Γ. So tau = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should double-check the units. Gamma is given in MeV. Hbar has units of GeV·s, if I remember correctly. Let me think: Planck's constant h is approx 6.626e-34 J·s. h-bar is h/(2pi), so same order of magnitude. But in energy terms, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1.6e-10 J. So h-bar is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Right, because h-bar in GeV·s is approximately 6.582e-25. So, when I calculate tau, it would be h-bar divided by Gamma, but I have to make sure the units are compatible.

Gamma is given as 320 MeV. So that's 0.32 GeV. So Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = h-bar / Gamma. H-bar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, so tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is approximately 2.0569e-24 seconds.

Wait, okay, now that I've got tau, the next step is to find the decay length. But decay length needs velocity and lifetime. Oh, but wait, the meson is produced with some energy, so it's moving relativistically. So I need to find the Lorentz factor gamma and the beta (v/c) to calculate the mean decay length.

The production energy E is 8 GeV. The mass of the meson is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy
