Okay, so I need to figure out this multiple-choice question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

So, there are two stars, star_1 and star_2. In the photosphere of star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Wait, LTE means that each region of the star's photosphere is in thermal equilibrium with a blackbody at temperature T. So, the excitation states can be described by the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the population ratio of two energy levels. 

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant. So, n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). 

In this problem, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Let's consider the excited state and a lower state. Let's say in star_1, the number of atoms in the higher energy level is twice that in star_2. Wait, no, wait. The question says in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So the population in the specific energy level is twice as much as in star_2.

So, the ratio for star_1 is n1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n2 / n_lower2). Wait, maybe not. Or perhaps the ratio is n_high / n_low for each star. Star_1 has n_high1 / n_low1 = 2 times the ratio in star_2, which is n_high2 / n_low2. So, (n_high1 / n_low1) = 2 * (n_high2 / n_low2).

But according to Boltzmann, n_high / n_low = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is E_high - E_low. Since the energy difference is the same for both stars (same iron atoms, same transition), ΔE is the same. Let's denote ΔE as 1.38e-23 J.

So for star_1: ratio R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))

For star_2: ratio
