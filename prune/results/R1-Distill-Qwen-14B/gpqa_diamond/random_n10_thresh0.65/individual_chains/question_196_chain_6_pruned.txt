Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass is attached to a spring, right? But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I think that means we're considering speeds that are significant compared to the speed of light. Oh right, because in classical mechanics, the speed is much less than c, but relativistic effects become important when v approaches c.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the spring constant is k. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The answer choices are options A to D, each involving some combination of k, A, m, and c.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, right? But wait, the question is about the relativistic case, so option C is probably not correct.

In relativity, the energy is given by the total relativistic energy equation. The total energy E includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, when the mass is at
