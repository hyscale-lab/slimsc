Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is S_z. So, the state |alpha> is a linear combination of these two states. But the problem says it's proportional, so maybe I'll need to normalize it later.

Next, the question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of such an operator are different from the standard ones. Wait, what kind of matrix is this?

Let me think. The operator's matrix is a 2x2 matrix because it has |up> and |down> as basis states. So, for 2x2, the elements would be:
A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1, same for A_22),
A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2.

So the matrix looks like:
[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, but that's a 2x2 matrix. What's the operator for which this is the matrix? Oh, right, I think that's the Pauli matrix multiplied by something. The Pauli matrices usually have 0s and 1s, but this one has hbar/2 off-diagonal elements and zeros on the diagonal. So maybe it's (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the operator in question is (hbar/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of this operator. So I need to find the eigenstates of σ_x because the operator is proportional to it. The eigenstates of σ_x are the states that are superpositions of |up> and |down>, but in a specific way. Oh wait, I remember that the
