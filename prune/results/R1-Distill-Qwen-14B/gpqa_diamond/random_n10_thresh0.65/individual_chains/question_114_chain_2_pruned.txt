Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something (A) to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, typically, what happens? Oh, right! It's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I think for that, you might need an acid catalyst. Because the carbonyl oxygen is deprotonated in the presence of a base, but to get the nucleophilic attack, maybe you need some acid.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, I might be mixing things up. For the addition of HCN or its equivalents to ketones, it's usually done under acidic conditions. Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- can attack.

So, in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that out. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the ketone (C=O) has been converted into a cyanohydrin.

Yes, that's the formation of a cyanohydrin. The reaction of ketones with HCN in acidic conditions. Alternatively, sodium cyanide (NaCN) would provide the cyanide ion, but I think you need an acid catalyst for the reaction because HCN is weakly acidic. The acid helps protonate the carbonyl, making it more reactive towards the nucleophilic attack by CN-.

So, reagent A should be an acid. Looking at the options, A and B for reagents are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is just a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4 providing H+ ions. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid but can act as a source of bis
