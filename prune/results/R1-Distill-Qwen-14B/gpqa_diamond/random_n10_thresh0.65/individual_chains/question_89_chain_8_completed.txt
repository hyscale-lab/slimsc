Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a diamond-shaped molecule, which is pretty rigid and has multiple fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane skeleton.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. KOH is a strong base, but in the case of vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromo something), this sounds like a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Wait, no, wait—wait, no, wait: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a 1,3-dihalo compound. Hmm, when you treat dihalides with a base, especially in elimination reactions, you typically get an elimination product, like an alkene. But wait, if it's 1,3-dihalo, elimination might not be straightforward because the two leaving groups are not adjacent. Oh, but wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure. Let me think. Maybe the base induces a ring-opening elimination?

Wait, no, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on 1 and 3. So, let's imagine the structure of adamantane. The positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons? Or maybe they're separated. Wait, no, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. The positions 1 and 3 are probably not adjacent, so eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond between 1 and 3? That seems a bit far, but perhaps in the rigid structure, the elimination is possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a different process.

Wait, looking at the NMR data of product 1: the 1H NMR spectrum shows 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. Oh, IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So reaction with KOH probably forms a ketone or some carbonyl-containing compound.

Wait, KOH is a strong base. If it's an E2 elimination, but wait, 1,3-dibromide might not eliminate easily because the two bromines aren't adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated individually, producing two separate eliminations. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening. Another thought: maybe the KOH is causing a Hofmann elimination, but that's usually for amines. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form a ketone. Wait, 1,3-dibromide, when treated with a strong base, could form a carbonyl via a double elimination. Let me think: if both Br leave, forming a double bond, but that's not possible because the two Brs are on adjacent carbons? Or wait, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, but then another elimination would require another HBr. Hmm, but that might result in a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the IR indicates a carbonyl, which suggests that an elimination has occurred to form a ketone. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a Dieckmann elimination, but that's for cyclic esters. Alternatively, maybe it's not elimination but substitution. Wait, but KOH is a base, more likely to cause elimination than substitution, especially with vicinal dihalides.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a ketone via a different mechanism. Wait, if the dihalide is treated with a strong base, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Wait, how? For instance, when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can form a ketone if the two leaving groups are on adjacent carbons and can eliminate to form a triple bond, but wait, that would form an alkene, not a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the base causes the dihalide to form a geminal diolate, which then loses water to form a carbonyl. Wait, that's possible. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, could form a diol by substitution, but with excess KOH, perhaps elimination occurs.

Wait, but in substitution, each Br would be replaced by OH. But if you have two OH groups on adjacent carbons, they could eliminate to form a carbonyl. Oh! So if you have 1,3-diol, which is HO-C-C-OH, but wait, the positions are 1 and 3. Oh wait, no, wait: 1,3-diol would have OH on C1 and C3. But for elimination, the OH groups would need to be on adjacent carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination to form an epoxide? No, that doesn't fit the IR data. Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is an epoxide, but the IR doesn't suggest that. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester or amide, but no, the IR is at 1720, which is a ketone or possibly an ester.

Wait, but another reaction I'm thinking of is that when a dihalide is treated with a base, like KOH, it can form a conjugated diene. But that may not form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH in a double elimination, where two HBr molecules are eliminated, leading to a diene. But then, how does that produce a carbonyl group? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the product's NMR and IR. The IR at 1720 is a carbonyl, likely a ketone. So the product is a ketone. So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which upon treatment with KOH gives a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can form an oxide. For example, vicinal dihalides can form epoxides. But 1,3-dibromide would not form a simple oxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,3-diolate which can undergo some kind of elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, but if you have a diol, perhaps it can form a cyclic structure. Wait, 1,3-diol, when treated with acid or base, can form a cyclic ketone. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, where each Br is removed with a base, leading to a carbonyl group. But how? Maybe each elimination forms a double bond, but that would require the two Br to be in a position that allows for conjugated elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a carbene intermediate, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone via a different pathway. Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of Br- and forming a double bond, but that would require the two Br to be in a position that allows for adjacent elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the structure of product 1 is adamantanone. Because 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with strong base, could lose two HBr molecules to form a ketone between carbons 1 and 3. So, for example, the structure would be where the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond, but wait, that would form an alkene, not a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the base causes the two Br to be eliminated with the formation of a carbonyl group. So each Br leaves, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. Wait, that would require the two Br to be on adjacent carbons, which may not be the case in 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So in the adamantane structure, carbons 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't a simple elimination. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests perhaps a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is a lot of protons, maybe from the adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another methylene group.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's a ketone, which would make the structure adamantanone. So, in that case, the reaction would be the elimination of two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane to form a ketone. So the product would be 1-adamantanone, perhaps?

Wait, but 1-adamantanone would have a carbonyl at position 1. Then, looking at the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) might be a methylene group adjacent to the ketone. But wait, in adamantanone, the carbonyl is on a bridgehead carbon. So each bridgehead in adamantane is a quaternary carbon. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the carbonyl would be on a bridgehead, which is a quaternary carbon, but then there would be no H attached. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, product 1 might be a diketone. Or maybe it's a different structure altogether.

Wait, another approach: the initial product after KOH is a ketone. So the product 1 is a ketone, and then when product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, it forms product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation reactions. Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone, and then treated with Al(isoprop)O, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, and adamantane isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkene, not a ketone. Wait, but the IR says 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation. Each Br leaves, and two H's are abstracted, leading to the formation of a triple bond. But a triple bond would have a lower IR absorption, around 2100, not 1720. So that's probably not right.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the KOH is causing a ring-opening. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, perhaps the base breaks a ring and forms a ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl group formed via elimination of two HBr molecules to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck on product 1. Let's think about the next steps. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, to form product 3.

The question is about the NMR of product 3. Specifically, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

So, perhaps I should figure out each step's product.

Let me try again. Product 1: after KOH, we have a light yellow solid with a ketone group (IR 1720). The NMR shows three signals. 4.79 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That might be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely from the adamantane structure, perhaps as a series of equivalent protons.

So, perhaps product 1 is 1-adamantanol (but that would have an OH group, which would show a broad peak, which isn't mentioned). Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. Let me think: 1-adamantone is a ketone, but as I thought earlier, the carbonyl is on a bridgehead, which is a quaternary carbon. So no H attached there. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a secondary alcohol. But the IR doesn't show a broad peak for O-H. Alternatively, perhaps it's a primary alcohol, but that would have a triplet for the adjacent CH2.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is not a ketone but an ester. Because an ester's carbonyl is around 1720 cm-1. So if product 1 is an ester, then perhaps the structure is such that two OH groups are formed, which then react with KOH to form an ester. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which then eliminates to form a carbonyl. Wait, but the IR is already showing a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but in a way that forms a carbonyl group. Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's imagine that the two Br are on adjacent carbons in a way that when eliminated, they form a carbonyl group. For example, perhaps the structure is such that after elimination, the two carbons each lose a Br and form a double bond, but that would make an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a diketone. But I'm not familiar with a reaction that directly converts a dihalide to a diketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an example of the Corey-Fuchs reaction or some other elimination, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR data again. Product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet or a doublet. The triplet is possible if it's a CH2 next to another CH2. But 4.79 is upfield for a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps. Maybe an ether group? But that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, unless it's another functional group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a secondary alcohol, but the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch. So that can't be.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a ketone where the carbonyl is in a bridge position. So, perhaps the structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond, but wait, how would that form a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple elimination but a substitution. But KOH is more likely to promote elimination in dihalides.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, which then loses water to form a ketone. But again, that would require the diol to be on adjacent carbons.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr, and then another base abstracts another β-hydrogen leading to another elimination, forming a carbonyl. So each Br is on a position where elimination can occur. So, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, each can lose a Br and a hydrogen, forming a double bond between them. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on to the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions, which require an aromatic ring. But adamantane isn't aromatic. So perhaps product 1 is something else.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a cyclic ether. But that doesn't fit the IR data.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. But again, the IR would show an absorption around 1200-1300 cm-1 for the epoxide, which isn't mentioned.

Wait, maybe product 1 is not a ketone. Let me consider that the IR at 1720 cm-1 could also be an ester or an aldehyde. But an aldehyde would have a higher chemical shift in NMR and a strong IR around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, which isn't mentioned. So more likely, it's a ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cycloketone, which is formed from the dihalide via elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's time to look for another approach. Let's think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a diene typically breaks the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. But product 3 is formed by ozonolysis, so product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, but how does product 2 form from product 1 and aluminum isopropoxide? If product 1 is a ketone and product 2 is a diene, perhaps product 1 is an alkyne, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, product 1 could be an epoxide, and product 2 is formed by ring-opening with Al isopropoxide. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, another angle: the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So what kind of coupling would that be?

If product 3 comes from ozonolysis of a diene, then product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would break the diene into two carbonyl compounds, perhaps. If the diene is symmetric, then product 3 could have equivalent carbonyl groups, leading to a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, ozonolysis of a conjugated diene typically yields two carbonyl compounds. For example, ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehydes. But in adamantane derivatives, the diene would be part of the ring structure.

But wait, the initial product after ozonolysis is product 3. So, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two ketones or aldehydes.

Assuming that, the NMR of product 3 would show signals from the carbonyl groups and any adjacent protons.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative atoms or in a strained environment. So, perhaps these are the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

In ozonolysis, the breaking of the double bond would generate carbonyl groups. So, any protons attached to carbons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

For example, if the diene was part of a cyclohexene ring, ozonolysis would break it into two ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but let's tie this back to the earlier steps. Product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of enolate? Or maybe product 2 is a diene formed via some elimination.

Wait, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. If product 1 is a ketone, and it's treated with a Lewis acid, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization or elimination. For example, in the presence of a Lewis acid, a ketone could undergo a pinacol rearrangement if it's a 1,2-diol, but product 1 isn't a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and the Lewis acid facilitates some kind of elimination.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and the Lewis acid catalyzes its elimination to form a diene. So, if product 1 is a diol, heating with Al isopropoxide could lead to the loss of water, forming a double bond. But product 2 would then be a diene, which would undergo ozonolysis.

But I'm not entirely certain about this. Let me try to piece this together.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → treated with KOH → product 1 (a ketone). Then, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide → product 2 (a diene). Then, product 2 is ozonolyzed to product 3.

If product 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis will break it into two carbonyl compounds. The structure of product 3 will depend on where the double bonds were in product 2.

Now, considering the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl groups. For each of these protons, their coupling depends on neighboring protons.

Wait, let's imagine that product 2 is a diene in a bridge structure of adamantane. Ozonolysis would break the diene into two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group. For example, if product 2 is a 1,3-diene in adamantane, breaking it would create two ketones, each connected to a CH2 group.

So, in product 3, each of these CH2 groups would be next to a carbonyl. The protons on these CH2 groups would be deshielded. The coupling pattern would depend on how many neighboring protons they have.

If each CH2 has only one neighboring proton on each adjacent carbon, perhaps the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, but let me think. If the structure after ozonolysis is two carbonyl groups connected to CH2 groups, each CH2 would have two protons. Each of these protons would be next to a carbonyl group, and perhaps adjacent to another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. No, that wouldn't fit the ozonolysis of a diene.

Wait, ozonolysis of a 1,3-diene would yield two carbonyl groups. For example, breaking the double bonds would give two aldehyde or ketone groups. But in adamantane, the diene would be part of a bridge, so ozonolysis would cut the bridge and form two carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 3 has two carbonyl groups connected to a CH2 group, each CH2 would have two protons. Each of these protons would be adjacent to a carbonyl and perhaps have neighboring protons on the same CH2.

So, each of these protons would be split by neighboring protons. If each CH2 has two protons, and each is next to another CH2 group, the coupling could be a triplet.

Wait, but each CH2 group's protons would be adjacent to another CH2 group. So for each proton on a CH2, there would be two neighboring protons (the other on the same CH2 and the adjacent CH2's protons). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are each attached to a carbonyl, and each CH2 has two protons. Each proton on a CH2 would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet.

Wait, but if each CH2 has two protons, and each is adjacent to another CH2 with two protons, then each proton would couple with two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in reality, each CH2 is a -CH2-C=O group.

So, the structure would be something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O 

Wait, but that would imply a four-carbon chain, which might not fit. Alternatively, if product 2 is a diene like 1,3-diene in a six-membered ring, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group. So each CH2 would have two protons, and these protons would be adjacent to each other. So each proton would have one neighboring proton on the same CH2 and perhaps some coupling with protons on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2's protons would be next to each other, but each CH2 is between two carbonyls. So, each CH2's protons would be next to each other and perhaps also to protons on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in that case, each CH2 would have two protons. Each of these protons would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each proton would have two neighboring protons, resulting in a triplet.

Alternatively, considering that each CH2 is between two carbonyls, the CH2 protons would be in a symmetrical environment. Each CH2's protons would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, for each proton, there are two neighboring protons, which would split the signal into a triplet.

Therefore, in the NMR spectrum of product 3, the most deshielded protons (on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl) would show a triplet coupling pattern.

Looking back at the options, option A is triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step involves heating with KOH, which likely results in a double elimination of HBr, forming a ketone (product 1). The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a carbonyl group at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports the formation of a ketone, likely adamantanone.

In the second step, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely facilitates further elimination, forming a conjugated diene (product 2). The structure of product 2 is consistent with a diene within the adamantane framework.

In the third step, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bonds in the diene, forming two carbonyl-containing products (product 3). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group and is coupled to neighboring protons. Given the structure of product 2, the protons on the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls in product 3 will exhibit a triplet coupling pattern due to coupling with two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.

Answer: A
