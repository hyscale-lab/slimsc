Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that reactions with red phosphorus and HI usually involve the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Or wait, maybe it's about something else. Oh right, when you have an alkyne and treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's a hydration reaction. So if Compound X is an alkyne, it might get converted into a diol or something else.

But wait, the question isn't giving me the structure of X. So I have to figure out what X is from the IR and NMR data provided. Let me look at the data.

The IR shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad region usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But it's a single peak in that range, not two. So maybe it's an O-H stretch. But wait, the peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be aromatic C=C stretching. So that suggests that the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet, which could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Alternatively, an acidic proton like from
