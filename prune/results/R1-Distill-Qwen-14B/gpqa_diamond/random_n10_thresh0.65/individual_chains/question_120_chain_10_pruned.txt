Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed, and asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on parallax.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So I need to figure out how the density of stars changes with parallax. Since parallax is related to distance, maybe I should think in terms of distance and how star density varies with that.

Assuming uniform distribution, that probably means that stars are spread out uniformly in space. Oh wait, no. Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So I think that's in terms of their positions on the celestial sphere, regardless of distance. But wait, maybe that's not the right way to interpret it. Or perhaps it refers to their distribution as seen from Earth, which would involve their apparent brightness and distances.

Wait, uniform distribution in the skyâ€”so maybe the number of stars per unit area in the sky is uniform. But how does that translate to their actual distribution in space?

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit volume of space. Because if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their density (number per volume) would be constant. But the question is about
