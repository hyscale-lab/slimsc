Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about neutrino flux from the Sun. Let me start by understanding the question thoroughly. 

So, the problem says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions continue as usual. I'm supposed to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's fusion process. The proton-proton chain has a couple of branches. The main one is the pp-I, which produces helium-4, and the pp-II and pp-III are less significant. Wait, but pp-III involves higher energy processes, maybe producing more high-energy neutrinos?

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly through the beta plus decay in the fusion reactions. The pp-I branch produces a lot of neutrinos, but the pp-II and pp-III are other pathways. So, if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for the neutrino flux?

I think the neutrinos from the Sun are produced with a range of energies. The main peak is around 200-400 keV, I believe, but there are also higher energy neutrinos. The pp branches might produce neutrinos with higher energies.

So, the pp-III branch stopping would reduce the number of high-energy neutrinos. But how does that affect the flux in the two specific bands?

Wait, the neutrino flux is the number of neutrinos per cmÂ² per second. So, if pp-III stops, which contributes more to higher energy neutrinos, the flux in higher bands would decrease more than lower ones.

But the question is about the ratio of the flux between two bands. So, what determines the flux in each band?

I think that the flux per unit energy (the energy spectrum) decreases at higher energies. Because most neutrinos are in the lower energy range. But the exact shape depends on the production mechanisms.

When the pp-III branch stops, which I think is responsible for producing some high-energy neutrinos, the number of neutrinos in higher energy bands would drop.

Wait, let me think about the neutrino production in the Sun. The dominant process is pp-I, which produces a neutrino when a proton captures a positron (or vice versa) in the decay. The energy of these neutrinos is typically a few hundred keV. The pp-II and pp-III branches produce higher-energy neutrinos.

If pp-III stops, then the production of those higher-energy neutrinos would stop. So, the flux in the higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would decrease more than in the lower ones (700-800 keV).

But wait, if the pp-III branch contributes neutrinos to the higher band, then without it, the flux in band 2 (800-900) would drop more than band 1 (700-800). So the ratio of band1 to band2 would increase.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Suppose that without pp-III, the flux in band2 would be less. So Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would be higher, because the denominator is smaller.

But how much would each flux decrease?

I think that the pp-III branch produces a significant fraction of the high-energy neutrinos but perhaps a smaller fraction of the lower ones.

Let me think about the neutrino energy spectrum. The flux decreases with increasing energy. So without pp-III, the high-energy flux (band2) would decrease more, so the ratio band1/band2 would be higher. But how much higher?

If the pp-III produces neutrinos in the higher bands, then without it, the higher bands have lower flux. So, the ratio of band1 to band2 would increase.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III contributes neutrinos in both bands, but more so in
