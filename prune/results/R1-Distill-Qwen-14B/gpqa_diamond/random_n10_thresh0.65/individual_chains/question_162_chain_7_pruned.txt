Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the spacetime geometry. But here, it's probably a 2-dimensional space since it's dx² + dy², so maybe it's a 2D surface.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I think it's also called a hyperbolic space. Unlike a sphere, which has positive curvature, a pseudosphere has negative curvature, so it's like a saddle shape extending infinitely.

So the area of a pseudosphere. I remember that the area of a sphere in 2D (which is a circle) is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, the area is different because of the negative curvature. Wait, but wait—does the area converge or diverge? Because a pseudosphere extends infinitely, so maybe the area is infinite?

Alternatively, maybe the metric given here is representing something else. Let's look at the metric again. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x² + y² < 4, the denominator is positive. But when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric terms blow up. That suggests that the space is only defined for x² + y² <4. Wait, but I thought pseudospheres are non-compact
