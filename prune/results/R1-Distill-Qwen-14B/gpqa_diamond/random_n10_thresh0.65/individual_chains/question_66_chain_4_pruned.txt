Okay, I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory used when the new physics is at a high energy scale, so we can write down all possible interactions respecting the Standard Model (SM) symmetries but with higher-dimensional operators.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I'm pretty sure SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Effective theories generally don't break the symmetries of the underlying theory unless it's a specific case. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so all SMEFT operators should too.

Poincare symmetry includes translations and Lorentz transformations. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries? SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it also have to respect Poincare? Well, the SM is Poincare-invariant, so SMEFT as an effective theory should inherit that. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. Does SMEFT require that all operators respect CP? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that SMEFT operators can have terms that violate CP if the underlying new physics does so. So in the most general case, operators don't have to respect CP symmetry, unless the theory is constrained by some other principle. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if the SM includes CP symmetry (except for certain cases, like in the CKM matrix), then SMEFT maintains the SM symmetries unless modified. Hmm, maybe not. Because in the SM, CP is not a symmetry (since there's CP violation), so SMEFT operators can violate CP as well. So maybe CP isn't a symmetry that must be preserved.

CPT symmetry is a big one. The Standard Model has CPT symmetry, meaning that any effective theory derived from it must respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, I think, so yes.

Wait, what about Poincare? Because if Lorentz symmetry is respected, then Poincare is automatically a part of that. Or is it? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But SMEFT is a Lore
