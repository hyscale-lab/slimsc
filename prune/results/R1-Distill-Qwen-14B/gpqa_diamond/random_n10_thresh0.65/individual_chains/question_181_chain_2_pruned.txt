Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their fluxes in two different energy bands. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton chain. I think the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches are parts of this chain. The question specifies that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago, but all other reactions remain the same. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So any changes in the Sun's core would take that time to reach us. That makes sense because neutrinos might escape almost immediately, but if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos would have to come from regions where the reactions are still active.

So, the pp-III branchâ€”I should recall what reactions are part of that. I remember that the pp-III process involves the fusion of helium-3 into helium-4 via a beryllium intermediate. But wait, isn't the main pp process pp-I and pp-II? Oh right, pp-I is the dominant one, where two protons fuse with a deuteron, and then another proton to form helium-3, which then combines with another helium-3 to make helium-4. The pp-II branch is when a helium-3 captures a helium-3, producing two protons and beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to become boron-8, which decays into Be-7 again. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a specific part of the helium burning, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III is a side reaction, perhaps involving higher energy levels or different paths but not the main ones.

But regardless, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So this affects the production of neutrinos. Most solar neutrinos come from the pp chain, particularly the pp-I branch, which produces electron neutrinos via the fusion steps. But if pp-III stops, what neutrinos does that affect?

Wait, neutrinos are produced in several processes in the Sun. The main source is the proton-proton chain, which produces electron neutrinos when a boron-8 decays into Be-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. So, if the pp-III branch was part of the production chain for Beryllium or Boron, then stopping it would reduce the number of boron-8 decays, thus the number of neutrinos produced.

So if the pp-III stops, the production of neutrinos from that part would stop. But wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III is stopped. So neutrino production from other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) continues normally.

But the neutrinos take about 8.5 minutes to reach Earth, same as light. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have been traveling towards us, but their source is no longer producing them. So the flux would decrease for the neutrinos that come from the pp-III process.

But the question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Both bands are in the range of solar neutrinos, which are typically around hundreds of
