Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's read it carefully. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it forms complexes with metal ions.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, so I guess activity coefficients are close to 1. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard. The K for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. K usually refers to the formation constant here, so that's the stability constant for the complex.

Wait, the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions. Because EDTA complexes the Ca²+ ions, so the free [Ca²+] will be low. The formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the complex is 0.02 M, that's the concentration of Ca-EDTA.

But wait, the complex is 1:1, right? So the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. So, let's think about the dissociation. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- according to:

Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in solution, the concentration of EDTA is also part of the dissociation. Wait, but the initial solution has 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So, the total concentration of EDTA species (free EDTA^4- and the complex) would be more complicated. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, wait a second. Let's think in terms of the dissociation. Let's denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. So, when the complex dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So, the concentration of EDTA^4- would be x as well, assuming that the EDTA comes mostly from the complex. But wait, in reality, EDTA also exists in solution in different protonated forms, but since the pH is ideal, we can assume that the EDTA is in
