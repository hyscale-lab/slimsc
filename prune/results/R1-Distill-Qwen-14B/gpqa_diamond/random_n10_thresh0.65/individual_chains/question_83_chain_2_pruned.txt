Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The problem gives me some specific volumes and concentrations, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me read the question again. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, I think I need to figure out the initial concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / (40 cm³) = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.01 M. Wait, let me calculate that again. 20 * 0.05 is 1 mmol, and 40 cm³ is 0.04 L, so 1 mmol / 0.04 L is 0.025 M? Wait, no, maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles of acetic acid initially are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, I think that's correct. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, we can find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001. Moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question also asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Let me tackle each part: first, the pH at 25% titration, then the pH at equivalence point.
