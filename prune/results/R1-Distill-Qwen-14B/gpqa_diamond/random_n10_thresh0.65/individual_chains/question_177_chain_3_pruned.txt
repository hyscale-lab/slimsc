Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 has a velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me make sure. Wien's Law states that λ_max * T = constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then T must be the same because if λ_max is same, T would be same. So the temperatures are equal.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, but the stars are moving. Oh, but the problem mentions radial velocities. The radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along the observer's line of sight. How does that affect the observed wavelength?

Right! The Doppler effect comes into play here. Because Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength will be shifted. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 is different from its rest wavelength.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars "appeared brightest" at the same wavelengths. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So the observed wavelength for Star_1 is λ1, and for Star_2 it's λ2, and λ1 = λ2.

Wait, but Star_
