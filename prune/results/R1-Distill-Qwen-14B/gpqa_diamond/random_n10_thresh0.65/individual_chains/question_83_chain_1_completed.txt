Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The question gives me some specific volumes and concentrations, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka is also provided. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me jot down the given data. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. Then, it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh wait, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? Because concentration is moles per liter, and adding the same volume of water would halve the concentration. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate it properly. Moles of acetic acid before dilution: M = moles/L → moles = M × V. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when you add 20 cm³ of water (0.02 L), the new volume is 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let me first figure out the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But wait, they're asking about pH at 25% titration. Oh, right, 25% of the way to equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Let me handle each part step by step.

First, the 25% titration point:

At this point, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. Let's compute the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since acetic acid reacts with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio, the moles of acetic acid (HA) and acetate (A-) can be found.

Initial moles of HA: 0.001 moles.

Moles of HA reacted with NaOH: 0.00025 → remaining HA is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of A- formed: 0.00025 moles.

The total volume now is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let's compute pKa: log(1.85e-5) is approximately 4.73? Wait, wait:

Wait, 1e-5 is pH 5. 1.85 is about 1.85, so log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733. So approximately 4.73.

So, pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Let me calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.33333. Log(0.333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Option D's first value is 4.57, which is higher than our 4.25. Hmmm. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's recompute the ratio.

0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M

0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647.

Let me calculate 0.005882 / 0.017647 = (5.882e-3) / (1.7647e-2) = (5.882 /17.647) x 10^-1 → approx 0.33333, as before.

So log(0.3333) is indeed about -0.477.

So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 → approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, which is very close. So the first pH is about 4.25-4.26.

Now, moving to the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions in solution is the moles of acetate divided by the total volume after adding all the NaOH (10 cm³) to the initial 40 cm³, making 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles.

So [A-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-

The Kb for A- can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me calculate that.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) × 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

Because Kb is small, we can assume that the hydrolysis doesn't proceed much, and we can approximate x as negligible compared to initial concentration.

The expression for Kb is [HA][OH-] / [A-] = Kb.

Let me set up the ICE table.

Initial: [A-] = 0.02 M; [HA] = 0, [OH-] = 0.

Change: -x ; +x; +x.

At equilibrium: [A-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

[HA] = x

[OH-] = x.

So Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

Solving for x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH-] = 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → Let me compute that.

Log(3.288) is about 0.516. So log(3.288e-6) is 0.516 -6 = -5.484. So pOH is 5.484. Therefore, pH = 14 -5.484 = 8.516, which is approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence, the pH is around 8.52.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → seems to fit.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, when we reach equivalence, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. The acetate ion (A-) is a weak base. So the pH should be above 7, which option A has 8.52.

So the two values would be approximately 4.26 and 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is (4.26, 8.52). So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I calculate the 25% titration correctly?

Alternative approach: perhaps the initial dilution is handled differently. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M) * (0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. So 0.001 / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume is used. Equivalence is 10 cm³ as before, so 2.5 cm³ added.

Moles of NaOH in 2.5 cm³: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Which reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid.

So remaining HA: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of A-: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.73.

The ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 → 4.25. So 4.26 when rounded, matches option A.

At equivalence, pH is 8.52, which is in option A.

So the correct answer should be A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with NaOH at two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. The given data includes the initial concentration and volume of acetic acid (0.05 M, 20.00 cm³), the dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, and the Ka of acetic acid (1.85 × 10⁻⁵). The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M.

### 1. **Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**
- Moles of acetic acid before dilution:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### 2. **25% Titration Point**
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added. The equivalence volume is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Moles of NaOH required} = 0.001 \, \text{moles (same as moles of CH₃COOH)}.
\]
\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm³}.
\]
Thus, 25% of the equivalence volume is:  
\[
0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm³} = 2.5 \, \text{cm³}.
\]
- Moles of NaOH added:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- Reaction with acetic acid:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH₃COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- Total volume after adding NaOH:  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- Concentrations:  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right).
  \]
  \[
  \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73.
  \]
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
  \]

### 3. **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻). The solution contains 0.001 moles of CH₃COO⁻ in a total volume of:  
\[
40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]
- Concentration of CH₃COO⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- Acetate ions hydrolyze in water:  
  \[
  \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
  \]
  The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
  \]
- Let the concentration of OH⁻ at equilibrium be \( x \). Then:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻} - x]} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
  \]
  \[
  x^2 = 0.02 \times 5.405 \times 10^{-10} = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
  \]
  \[
  x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
  \]
- pOH:  
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
  \]
- pH:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \approx 8.52.
  \]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
