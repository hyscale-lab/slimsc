Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

The options are A to D, each with different momentum values. The given data includes masses of X and Y, bond length R, and angular frequency w.

Wait, the model here is the non-rigid rotor model, which I think also includes vibration. So the energy levels probably involve both rotation and vibration. But I'm not exactly sure how they combine. Oh right, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher state. The next lowest state would likely be the next vibrational level (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1), but which one requires less energy?

Wait, the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon needs the least possible energy to cause the transition. That would be the smallest energy increment between the current state and the next.

So I need to find the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state, whether it's a change in vibration or rotation.

Let me think about vibrational and rotational energy. The vibrational energy levels have a spacing of h*w, because each vibrational quantum (quanta) adds h*w. For rotation, the energy levels depend on J, the rotational quantum number. The energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, but the molecule is a diatomic, so the moment of inertia I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. Oh right, μ is (mX * mY)/(mX + mY). Let me calculate that.

Given:
Mass X (Mx) = 20 amu
Mass Y (My) = 2 amu
So, μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert am
