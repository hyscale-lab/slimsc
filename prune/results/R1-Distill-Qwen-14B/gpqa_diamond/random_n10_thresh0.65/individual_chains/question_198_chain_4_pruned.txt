Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. I think the key here is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then find out what percentage the dithiocyanato complex (probably [Co(SCN)_2] or something similar) contributes.

Wait, wait. I remember that the stability constant, β, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. For each step, βn is the constant for the nth complex. So, for example, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on.

So the complexes are Co(SCN)_n. The four given βs suggest that there are four possible complexes: n=1, 2, 3, 4. But wait, wait. The problem mentions "dithiocyanato" which I think refers to two SCN- ligands. So the dithiocyanato complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Our goal is to find the percentage of this complex among all Co species.

I think I need to determine the distribution of the cobalt species across all possible complexes and then find the fraction that is the dithiocyanato one.

So the approach would be:

1. Consider that the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the possible cobalt species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}? Wait, wait, wait. Let me think about the charges.

Wait, Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) would have a charge of +2 -n. Because each SCN- contributes -1, and Co is +2. So:

n=0: Co^2+ => charge +2
n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → +2 -1*(1) = +1
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → +2 -2*(1)=0
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → +2 -3= -1
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → +2 -4= -2

Wait, but the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the nth complex. So the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), third is [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), and the fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^{
