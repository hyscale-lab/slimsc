Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to determine which energy difference between them would allow us to clearly distinguish the two levels.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known. In this case, I think it applies to energy and time.

Wait, the uncertainty principle formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh but sometimes it's approximated as ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2, but maybe the exact factor isn't critical here since we're looking for an order of magnitude.

So, the idea is that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) can't be smaller than a certain value. Here, the time uncertainty is the lifetime of the state, right? Because the lifetime is how long the state exists before it decays or changes, which introduces uncertainty in the energy measurement.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So, for the two states, E1 has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 sec and E2 has τ2 = 1e-8 sec. But the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, which would be ΔE = E2 - E1. Wait, but I'm not sure if it matters which is larger, but the product ΔE * Δt has to be larger than
