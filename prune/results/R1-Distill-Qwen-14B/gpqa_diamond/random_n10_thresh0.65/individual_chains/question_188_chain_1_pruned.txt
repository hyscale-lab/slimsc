Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. 

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal again? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the lattice parameters are equal, and all the angles are the same. So it's like a cube that's been compressed or expanded along the diagonals, making all edges equal but the angles possibly different from 90 degrees. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh, right, so it's a rhombohedral or trigonal crystal system.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Hmm, wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice. Since it's a rhombohedral crystal, I think the lattice is a cubic one but with all sides equal and angles equal. So each edge length a is 10 Angstroms.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula I remember for interplanar distance d is d = a / (sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosα + 2hl cosβ + 2kl cosγ )) ), but wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the formula for d in terms of lattice parameters is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^
