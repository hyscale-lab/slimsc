Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see... The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions. There's also some hints provided, which I should definitely consider.

First, let me read through the reaction steps again:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Hmm. Also, there are two hints.

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction, which forms alkenes. So this suggests that compound A has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) because the Wittig reaction converts carbonyls into alkenes.

Hint b tells me about the IR spectra. Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which usually indicates a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester). Compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1, which is slightly lower wavenumber. A ketone's carbonyl is around 1700-1750, so 1715 would still suggest a ketone. Maybe there's a change in the structure that affects the carbonyl's position, like conjugation or ring strain.

Now, the options are all ketones because they have the suffix -one. So compound E is a ketone, and so was A probably a ketone as well.

Let me think about each step:

1. A + HCN â†’ B. So A is a ketone, and adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Wait, but the reaction of ketones with HCN typically gives a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin has an -OH and -CN group added to the carbonyl carbon. So compound B would be a vicinal diol? No, wait, wait. HCN adds to the carbonyl, so the product is an addition product. The structure would have an -O- group and a -CN group attached to the same carbon. So from a ketone, you get a secondary alcohol with a cyano group on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, no. Let me recall: When a ketone reacts with HCN (under acidic conditions, perhaps), it adds across the carbonyl, so the carbonyl carbon (originally double-bonded to O) becomes bonded to H, CN, and the rest of the molecule. So, for example, if A is cyclohexanone, then B would be cyclohexane cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a CN group adjacent.

But then, the next step is the reduction of B to C using H2 and Pd. H2 with Pd is a hydrogenation catalyst. So what gets reduced here? The B compound has a CN group. Hydrogenation of CN would typically lead to CH2NH2, but that's under certain conditions. Wait, wait. In the presence of H2 and Pd, maybe the nitrile is reduced. So, nitrile (CN) to amine (CH2NH2)? Or to an amine? Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine. But wait, another possibility is that the nitrile is reduced to an aldehyde. No, that's with LiAlH(t-BuO)3 or something else. Alternatively, H2 and catalysts can reduce nitriles to amines. So if B is a cyanohydrin (so an alcohol and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons), upon hydrogenation, the nitrile would become an amine. So C would have an -NH2 group where B had CN.

Wait, but let me think again
