Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the photospheres are in LTE, meaning we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Since the energy levels have a specific difference Î”E, I can model this.

In this case, star_1 has twice the excitation (n_i) as star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, no, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2. But wait, excitation here refers to the number in a higher energy level, right? So n_i is the number in the higher level, and n_j is the number in the lower level. So the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) would be 2 for star_1, and for star_2, the ratio is 1 (since it's not specified, but perhaps n_i' = half of n_j'?), no wait, the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1
