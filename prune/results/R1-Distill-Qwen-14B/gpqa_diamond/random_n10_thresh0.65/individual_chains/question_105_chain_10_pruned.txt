Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the setup is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. When we observe this star, the brightness variations due to rotation look similar to those caused by an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the star to produce the same brightness change?

Hmm. So, the problem is about comparing the brightness variation caused by spots on a star to that caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

Wait, I think the key here is to calculate the change in brightness in both scenarios and set them equal, then solve for the planet radius.

Let me break it down.

First, when there's a spot, the star's brightness changes because part of its surface is darker. A planet transiting would similarly block some light, causing a dip. But the brightness change depends on the area blocked and the temperature difference.

Wait, but wait—when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's disk. The change in brightness is (Area of planet / Area of star) * (1 - (T_planet / T_star)^4 ), but wait, no. Wait, actually, when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, so the dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is (R_p^2)/(R_s^2), and since flux is proportional to area, that's the fractional change. But wait, if the star's spots are cooler, their contribution to the star's light is less. So when the spots are facing us, the star appears dimmer, but when they're on the far side, it's normal. So the brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness variation due to the spots can resemble that of an exoplanet. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation (the change in brightness) is the same in both cases.

So, the brightness change from the spots is the same as that from the planet. So we can model both and set them equal.

First, let's model the star with spots.

The star's total flux without spots would be L = 4πR^2 σ T
