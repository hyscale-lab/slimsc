Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3, not below 1 or above 3. I need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm, right. I remember that the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like normalization. Oh right, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from all space should be 1. But in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function is zero outside this region. Wait, no, actually the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, but when x is less than 1 or greater than 3, the particle isn't found. So perhaps the wave function must be zero outside 1 to 3? Or wait, maybe the given wave function is only applicable between x=1 and x=3. Hmm, the question states that in the part of space where the particle can exist, the wave function is that expression. But when measuring, particles are found in 1<x<3, so perhaps the wave function is zero outside that region. So the wave function is only non-zero between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the given wave function doesn't have any terms that would make it zero outside. So maybe the wave function is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and zero otherwise. Or perhaps the wave function is such that it's non-zero only in that interval. So I think that's the correct approach.

So the wave function ψ(x) is:
ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3,
ψ(x) = 0 otherwise.

But wait, the wave function given in the problem seems to be a complex function. So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Wait, the wave function has both real and imaginary parts. So the absolute square is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 plus [0.5]^2, because when you square the modulus, it's (Re)^2 + (Im)^2. Because (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b².

So ψ(x) = A - 0.5i, where A is a/sqrt(1+x). So |ψ|^2 = A² + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is the wave function given in the problem only the real part, and the imaginary part is -0.5? Or is it a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5? Hmm, the way it's written is "(a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i", which suggests that it's a complex number with real part a/sqrt(1+x) and imaginary part -0.5. So ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i.

Wait, but when I square the absolute value, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)², because |a + ib|² = a² + b². So the square is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the normalization integral is ∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First, integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So the first part becomes a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because when x=3, 1+x=4, and x=1, 1+x=2.

So ln(4/2) = ln(2), so a² ln(2) is the first term.

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2) approximately? Around 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I did everything correctly.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Yes, that's correct.

So integrating from 1 to 3:

∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Set equal to 1: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.85.

Yes, so the answer is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in all space must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3, \quad \psi(x) = 0 \text{ otherwise}.
\]

The probability density is the square of the modulus of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Thus:

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
