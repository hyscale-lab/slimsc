Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics because the effects of relativity come into play. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m and are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate both the relative velocity and the total energy to pick the right answer.

Let me tackle the relative speed first. I think I remember that relative velocity in special relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, you can't just do a simple subtraction because velocities don't add linearly when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. The formula for adding velocities in relativity is different.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, that's the formula when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction. So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

No, wait, actually, in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference. But because they're at relativistic speeds, I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, because the astronauts are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is calculated by the observer as (u - v) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c.

Let me plug in the numbers. u = 0.6c, v = 0.5c.

So the numerator is (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c.

The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that: 0.6*0.5 = 0.3, and c² in numerator and denominator cancels, so 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative velocity is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.
