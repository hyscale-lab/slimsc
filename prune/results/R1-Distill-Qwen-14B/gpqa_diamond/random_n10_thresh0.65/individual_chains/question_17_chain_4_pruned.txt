Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's read the question again.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, assuming the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this has to do with complex ion formation. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and we need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, right, when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the complex dissociates in solution. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction. So, for the Ca-EDTA complex, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

So, the formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5x10^10.

But wait, the problem gives us the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So, initially, I think that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we need to find [Ca²+].

Wait, but wait a second. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, that's the concentration of the complex, which I'll call [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Then, under the assumption that the dissociation is minimal (because K is large), the [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be small. But I should check.

Since Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, the reaction strongly favors the formation of the complex. So, the dissociation is minimal. Thus, the concentrations of the free ions (Ca²+ and EDTA^4-) would be very low.

Wait, but EDTA is a chelating agent, and in solution, it's usually in different protonated forms depending on pH. Oh, but the problem states the pH is ideal, which I think means it's at a pH where EDTA is in the correct form (like Y^4-), so we don't need to consider that.

So, let's set up the equation. The formation of the complex is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2
