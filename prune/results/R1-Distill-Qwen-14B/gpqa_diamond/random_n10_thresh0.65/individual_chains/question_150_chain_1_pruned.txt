Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that formula. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for organic compounds is CnH2n+2OxN. So, for C8H9NO, the H count is 9. Let's see: 2n+2 + (O and N adjustments). Wait, O and N each count as one degree each. The molecular formula can be broken down.

Wait, another way: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X (halogens) are zero. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus a double bond and a ring or something else. Alternatively, a benzene and a carbonyl group, maybe.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's list it:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Oh wait, but waitâ€”aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But sometimes, if there's an adjacent electron-withdrawing group, maybe shifted a bit. Triplet suggests coupling with two protons. So maybe it's a conjugated system, like an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde). Or perhaps an enamine or something else.

Then, 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H. That's around the aromatic region. Maybe para-substituted benzene rings. Hmm, because a doublet could mean coupling with two adjacent protons, which would suggest two adjacent substituents or perhaps being part of a meta coupling? Wait, if it's two protons as a doublet, maybe it's a pair of protons that are adjacent to each other, like in a para-substituted benzene. Wait, no. For a benzene ring, each proton is ortho and meta to substituents. But if a substituent is in the para position, neighboring protons would be meta to each other, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of an aromatic ring with substituents in the para positions. Alternatively, maybe it's an ortho coupling.

Wait, the next peak is 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. So two protons as a doublet, again in the aromatic region. Maybe these are the protons that are adjacent to substituents. So perhaps the molecule has two aromatic rings, each with substituents.

Then, 6.27 ppm: multiplet, broad singlet? Wait, it's written as 'bs' which I think is broad singlet, 2H. So two protons as a broad singlet. Hmm. Broad singlet often indicates exchange with a proton, like an -OH group, but wait, no, this is 1H NMR. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with two protons that are not splitting each other much, maybe in a conjugated system or part of a diene. Alternatively, maybe they're part of a vinyl group adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like in an enal.

Then, 3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H. That's in the CH2 region. A doublet here suggests that these two protons are adjacent to another set of equivalent protons. Maybe it's a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom or part of an ether linkage. Or perhaps a methylene group next to another CH2.

Putting this together, let's try to sketch a structure. The aldehyde at 9.72 ppm suggests an aldehyde group. The two aromatic doublets at around 7 ppm and 6.5 ppm suggest two different sets of aromatic protons. The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet; maybe this is
