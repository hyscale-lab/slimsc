Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means their density is the same everywhere. I remember that parallax is related to distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, wait—parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, right?

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax. So it's about the density in terms of parallax. I think I need to relate this to the volume of space at a certain distance.

Wait, parallax (p) is 1/d, where d is distance. So if a star has a parallax p, it's at distance d = 1/p. Now, if I consider a thin shell at a distance d, the thickness of the shell would be dd, and the volume would be the surface area of the sphere times dd. The surface area is 4πd², so the volume element would be 4πd² dd.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So maybe I should express everything in terms of p instead of d. Since d = 1/p, then dd = -1/p² dp. Oh, but since we're dealing with a small change in p, I can just think about the absolute value. So the volume element as a function of p would be 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, let me see:

d =
