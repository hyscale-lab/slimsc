Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product of a reaction involving compound X. Let me start by looking at the given data.

The IR and NMR data are provided. I remember that IR can tell me about functional groups, and NMR tells me about the structure, like the environment of different protons.

Looking at the IR first. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region and might indicate OH or N-H stretching. But wait, the major peaks I should note are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. 

1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. That's usually a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around the ranges for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with substituents.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR. Let me list the peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is likely an -OH proton. But wait, in what functional groups? Alcohols, carboxylic acids, maybe phenols. But since the IR has 1720, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because the 1720 would be a carbonyl, and the broad peak at ~10 would be the -OH from the acid.

But wait, the 1720 could also be an ester or ketone. Let me think. If it's a ketone, then where is the oxygen? Maybe the IR would have a different peak. Hmm, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid's -OH. So maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking more at the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's a pair of doublets with integral 2 each. So probably two substituents on a benzene ring in a para arrangement. Like a para-substituted benzene. The 8.0 ppm is more downfield, which suggests those protons are next to an electron-withdrawing group. The 7.2 ppm would be the other pair, maybe in a more electron-rich area.

Then, 2.9
