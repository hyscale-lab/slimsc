Okay, so I have this physics problem about a diatomic molecule transitioning between states. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about when a photon is absorbed, causing the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule must transition to a higher energy state. But wait, the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh right, so it's about the smallest possible energy increase, which I think corresponds to promoting the molecule to the next level in either rotation or vibration. But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon, not the energy. Hmm.

Wait, but energy is related to photon momentum. Because E = pc for photons. Oh wait, no, E = hcν, where ν is the frequency. But p = E/c, so p = hν/(c). Alternatively, since photon momentum is p = h/(λ), and λ = c/ν, so it's the same as hν/c.

But the problem is about the molecule transitioning from its ground state to the next state. What states are available? Well, for a diatomic molecule modeled by the rotation-vibration model, the states are quantized in both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either increase its vibrational state (v) or its rotational state (J). But the next state with the lowest energy would be the one that requires the least energy. So which requires less energy, promoting vibration or rotation?

Hmm, for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing given by the harmonic oscillator model. The energy spacing is ΔE_vib = hν. The rotational energy levels have spacing ΔE_rot = B(2J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. The rotational constant B is given by B = (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest state, so the next possible states are either increasing J (rotation) or increasing v (vibration). Which transition has a lower energy? Probably the rotational, because the rotational energy levels are spaced closer together for small J. Let me think: For the ground state (v=0,
