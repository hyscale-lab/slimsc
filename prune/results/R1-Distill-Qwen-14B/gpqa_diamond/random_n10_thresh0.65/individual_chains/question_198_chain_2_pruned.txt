Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about cobalt ions and thiocyanate complexes. The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Wait, I think I remember that stability constants, β, are involved here. Stability constants tell us about the stability of complexes. Higher β means a more stable complex. So the problem gives me β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I think each β corresponds to a different complex.

So, Co(II) can form complexes with thiocyanate (SCN-) in different stoichiometries. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]^2-, and [Co(SCN)4]^3-. Since β values are given, each β is for a complex with a specific number of SCN- ligands.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)2], which would be the dithiocyanato complex. So we're looking to find the fraction of Co species that are in the form of [Co(SCN)2]²+.

The initial concentrations are given: [Co] total is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. But wait, [Co] probably refers to the total cobalt concentration, which includes all the species from Co²+ up to the various complexes.

So to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²+, I need to calculate the fraction of cobalt in that particular complex relative to all possible cobalt species.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be determined by the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand. Let's denote the complexes as:

- Co²+ → β1 [CoSCN+] → β2 [Co(SCN)₂]²+ → β3 [Co(SCN)3]²- → β4 [Co(SCN)4]^3-

Wait, actually, the order might matter. The first complex is [Co(SCN)]+ which has β1=9, then [Co(SCN)₂]²+ with β2=40, and so on. Each subsequent complex has more SCN- added.

But when calculating the fractions, we need to consider all possible complexes and the free ion. Because the solution can have Co²+ and various complexes.

I think the approach is to set up an expression where the fraction of each complex is proportional to their respective β values multiplied by the ligand concentration raised to the order. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the distribution of metal species in a solution
