Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

Alright, the question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two non-adjacent carbons in that structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. Let's think about what reaction occurs here. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are heated with a base, usually an elimination reaction happens, forming an alkene. But wait, since it's a di-substituted dibromide (1,3 positions), the elimination would form a double bond between the two carbons where the Br's were. So the product might be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar, but wait, that's not possible because if you eliminate from 1 and 3, the double bond would be between 1 and 2 or 2 and 3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structures wrong. Alternatively, since adamantane is a diamond-like structure, the elimination could form a bridged structure. Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a ring-opening? I'm a bit confused here.

Looking at the IR data: a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's in the range for a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe instead of elimination, a substitution reaction occurred. But with KOH, a base, substitution would be less likely than elimination. Wait, unless it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation with a base leading to a ketone? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-elimination, but that would give me a diene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps the reaction is not elimination but something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. If both Brs are in positions that allow for a neighboring group participation, maybe a double substitution could lead to a ketone. Oh wait, no, KOH is a strong base. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms
