Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can tell us something about their temperatures. 

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula I think is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, in this case, the question mentions that the energy difference between the energy levels is 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Oh wait, that's interesting because 1.38 is also the approximate value of Boltzmann's constant times a certain temperature? Wait no, k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, so they're giving ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. That's exactly k multiplied by 1 K. Oh that might be relevant.

So, let's see. Let's denote the ratio of populations for each star. For star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So, if I call the ratio for star_1 as (n1_upper / n1_lower) and for star_2 as (n2_upper / n2_lower), the problem says n1_upper / n1_lower =
