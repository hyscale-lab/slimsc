Okay, so I have this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and its quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that in such models, the molecule's energy states are quantized and depend on both rotation and vibration. The question is asking about the momentum of a photon needed to make the molecule switch to the next lowest energy state when it's in its fundamental state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher state. But what's the next lowest state? I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotational and vibrational transitions. But I'm a bit confused about whether this is a purely rotational transition or a vibrational one.

Wait, the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, no, the rigid rotor is when the bond length doesn't change, but the non-rigid one allows for bond vibrations. So the model combines both rotation and vibration.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's the first excited state, which could involve either a vibrational or rotational transition. But wait, the fundamental vibrational state is the lowest, so the next state might be the next vibrational state or a rotation change within the same vibrational state.

Wait, I think in the vibration-rotation spectrum, the fundamental vibrational transition is when the vibrational quantum number changes from 0 to 1, which is the lowest energy transition. But the rotational changes happen within the same vibrational level.
