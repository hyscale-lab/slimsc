Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me see what it's all about.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I remember that in the Standard Model, the Higgs field interacts with fermions via terms like this. So maybe X is similar to the Higgs boson here?

The mass of X is 6 GeV. Oh, and the question is about kinematically allowed decays of this boson X at the lowest order. So what do I know about boson decays? Well, for a boson to decay into fermions, the mass of the fermion pair must be less than the mass of the boson. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the total energy available is enough to create the particles.

So, X can decay into a pair of fermions f and f̄. The possible fermions depend on their masses. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so each fermion's mass must be less than half of that, because each would get at least half the mass (in the rest frame of X). Wait, no, actually, in the decay X → f f̄, the maximum mass each fermion can have is when they are produced at rest, so each would have mass m_f such that 2 m_f ≤ m_X. Because the total mass of the two fermions can't exceed the mass of the boson. So m_f ≤ m_X / 2.

Wait, X is 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let's think about the known fermion masses.

The known elementary fermions and their masses (approximate):

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, about 173 GeV, but X is 6 GeV, so way too heavy.
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, negligible.

So, for each fermion pair f f̄, the mass of each f must be less than or equal to 3 GeV. So the possible fermions are those with m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list the possible f:

- u: 2.2 MeV → yes
- d: 4.7 MeV → yes (since 4.7 < 3 GeV? Wait, 3 GeV is 3000 MeV, so yes)
Wait, wait, 4.7 MeV is way less than 3 GeV. Wait, no, 4.7 MeV is 0.00
