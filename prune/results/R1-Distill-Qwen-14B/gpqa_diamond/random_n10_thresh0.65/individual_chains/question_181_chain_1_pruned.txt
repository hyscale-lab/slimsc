Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains, right? There's the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch is one of the main contributors to the neutrino flux, especially for the 7 Be neutrinos and maybe others.

The question says that the pp-III branch stops about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the reaction stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the effect would just be reaching us now, right? So the neutrinos produced before that time would still be coming, but any new ones from that process would stop.

Neutrinos are produced in different energy ranges depending on the reaction. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos in certain energy bands. Let me think, the pp-III branch involves the decay of 7Be into 7Li, which emits a neutrino. Those 7Be neutrinos have energies around several hundred keV, maybe up to like 800 or 900 keV. So if the pp-III stops, the flux from that part would drop, but what about the other sources?

Wait, the pp-I and pp-II branches would still be ongoing. Or are they part of the same process? I'm a bit confused. I think the main neutrino flux from the Sun comes from the proton-proton chain, which has a few branches. The dominant one is the pp-I branch, which goes on to produce helium-4. The pp-II and pp-III are side branches.

Oh, right, the main neutrinos are from the pp-I and pp-III branches. The pp-I produces higher-energy neutrinos, while pp-III produces lower-energy ones? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. The 7Be neutrinos from the pp-III branch have energies around 400-800 keV, if I remember correctly. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos from the 3α process, which are higher energy, but I'm not sure about their exact range.

Wait, the question is about two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower, band 2 higher. If the pp-III stops, which neutrinos are affected?

The 7Be neutrinos are in the lower range, so if pp-III stops, the production of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range would drop. But what about the higher range? Are there other sources?

Wait, the other branches (pp-I and pp-II) might still be active. The pp-I leads to the production of neutrinos through the 3α process, which are higher energy, maybe around 800-900 keV or higher. So if pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 (700-800) would decrease, but band 2 (800-900) might be less affected because they're from the pp-I branch.

So the flux ratio is band1/band2. If pp-III is a major source for band1, then stopping it would mean that band1 flux drops, while
