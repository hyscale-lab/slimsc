Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Astronomers are looking at the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, so I think this involves some understanding of the Boltzmann equation and how the ratio of populations of energy levels depends on temperature. Right, the Boltzmann distribution tells us how particles distribute among different energy levels at thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is written as:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of particles in the upper and lower energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this case, the ratio in question is n1/n2. Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Without spots, the Teff is higher (6000K), and with spots, it's lower (5500K). 

Wait, but the question says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So when spots are present, the star's effective temperature is lower. How does this affect the ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels?

The ratio in question is n1/n2. In the equation, n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So for a higher temperature, the exponential term would be larger, making n2/n1 larger, which means n1/n2 is smaller. So if the star's temperature is lower when spots are present, T decreases. So let me think about how T affects n1/n2.

Wait, let's formalize this. Let me denote the ratio as R = n1 / n2.

From the Boltzmann equation, R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me rearrange the original equation. The original is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So R is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

But wait, I think the exact formula depends on whether the transition is absorption or emission, but in terms of population ratios, it's about the energy difference between the levels.

The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present (Teff=5500K), R is lower than when spots are absent (6000K). So without spots, R is higher than when there are spots. So the factor is R_un spotted / R_spotted.

Wait, the question says, what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is R_un / R_sp.

So R_un = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T_un)), where T_un is 6000K.

R_sp = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T_sp)), where T_sp is 5500K.

Since g1 and g2 are constants (statistical weights are fixed for each level), they'll cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the factor is exp(ΔE/(k T_un)) / exp(ΔE/(k T_sp)) ) = exp( ΔE/k (1/(T_un) - 1/(T_sp) ) )

Wait, wait, let's compute that.

ΔE is E2 - E1. But I don't have the actual energy difference. However, I know the wavelength of the transition. The transition corresponds to a photon emitted when an electron drops from level 2 to level 1. So the energy difference ΔE is given by the photon's energy: ΔE = h c / λ.

Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is 1448 Ångströms.

So let's calculate ΔE.

First
