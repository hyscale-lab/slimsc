Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm, I remember that heat equations are partial differential equations, and solving them numerically often involves methods like finite differences. The question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, and the key factor is one of the options given.

The question mentions matrix exponential functions being approximated by fractional approximations. Wait, matrix exponentials come up in solving systems of linear equations that arise from discretizing PDEs. In finite difference methods, when you have a time-dependent PDE, you often end up with a system that can be written in terms of matrix exponentials, right?

Parallel splitting, or splitting methods, I think are techniques used to make algorithms run faster by distributing computations across multiple processors. In the context of solving matrix equations, maybe it's about decomposing the matrix into parts that can be handled in parallel.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis. That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't produce growing errors. But I'm not sure how that directly converts a sequential method to parallel.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions can complicate things, but does that affect the parallelism? Not sure.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximations might involve eigenvalues or something related to roots, which could influence how the matrix is split. If the roots are complex, maybe it affects how the matrix can be decomposed for parallel processing. Like, if the matrix has complex eigenvalues, it might require certain splitting techniques.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fractions are used in breaking down functions into simpler parts. If the approximation can be split linearly, that might allow for parallel computation because each part could be handled separately.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Splitting methods often use the idea of decomposing the solution process into separate parts that can be computed in parallel. If the matrix exponential is approximated fractionally, the way you split it (like partial fractions) would determine how it can be computed in parallel. 

In the context of matrix functions, when you have a function f(A) where A is a matrix, you can sometimes express it as a sum of matrices that can be computed independently. For example, if you can write exp(A) as a sum of matrices that are easy to compute, you can evaluate each term in parallel.

So, linear partial fraction decomposition would allow you to split the matrix exponential into a sum of simpler terms. Each term might involve a different part of the original matrix, which can then be computed on different processors. This would convert the sequential computation (where you compute the entire matrix at once) into a parallel one.

Option D says linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. So, this would mean that the approximation is broken down into linear parts, each of which can be computed separately. That makes sense for parallel processing because each term could be handled by a different processor, leading to speedup.

Option C is about complex roots. I'm not sure how that ties directly into the parallel splitting. Maybe complex roots affect the stability or the method of approximation, but the key factor for parallelism is the decomposition into parts, which is more about partial fractions.

So, putting it together, the key factor is the linear partial fraction decomposition allowing the matrix to be split, hence enabling parallel computation. So the answer should be D.
