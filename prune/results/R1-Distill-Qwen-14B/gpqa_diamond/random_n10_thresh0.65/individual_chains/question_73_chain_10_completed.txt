Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when things move at speeds close to the speed of light, special relativity comes into play. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, so first I need to calculate the relative speed. But wait, in relativity, velocities don't just subtract like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you can't just say 0.6c minus 0.5c because that would be 0.1c. But relativistic velocity addition is different. I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2)).

So let me plug in the numbers. Let's take v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c. So the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2) → that's 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 → approximately 0.142857c, which is around 0.14c. I think that's one part down.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². So for each, I'll calculate their gamma factor and multiply by their mass.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute each one.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. So v = 0.6c → v² = 0.36c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * m1c² → 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v² = 0.25c² → 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660, so gamma is 1/(sqrt(0.75)) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma * m2 c² → 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 1.1547 *3 is approximately 3.464. So E1 is 2.5 mc², E2 is about 3.464 mc². Adding them together gives 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², which rounds to approximately 5.96 mc².

So the total energy should be about 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C has v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct option should be C.

Wait, but wait. Did I calculate the gamma correctly? Let me recheck. For the first astronaut: 0.6c is v. 1 - (0.6)^2 = 1 -0.36=0.64 → sqrt(0.64)=0.8 → gamma=1.25. Yes. So 1.25 times 2m is 2.5 mc², correct.

Second astronaut: 0.5c → (0.5)^2=0.25 → 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)= (√3)/2 ≈0.8660. So 1/gamma is 0.866 → gamma is about 1.1547. Multiply by 3m: 1.1547 *3 =3.464, yes. So total energy is 2.5 +3.464=5.964 ≈5.96 mc².

So the options where E is 5.96 mc² and v_rel is 0.14c is option C. So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic formula for relative velocity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**
