Okay, so I have this question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is: Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies? The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. So the idea is to make the theory finite by introducing a cutoff, and then maybe take that cutoff to infinity in the end. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or maybe they have some other mechanism.

Let me think about each theory. 

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and it's a candidate for a theory that unifies all forces. Since it's a theory that includes gravity, it deals with high energies. Wait, but I've heard that string theories are finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that other quantum field theories do. Because in superstring theory, all the interactions are computed using strings and their interactions, and maybe the perturbative expansion is finite, so they don't require regularization. Or wait, do they? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe in the perturbative approach, they still need to regularize, but perhaps in a non-perturbative sense, it's finite.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbative methods work. But what about regularization? Well, I remember that QCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory, which can have things like confinement and running coupling. But in terms of regularization, I think that QCD calculations often require some form of regularization, like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization, to handle loop integrals that would otherwise be divergent. So QCD does need regularization, at least in perturbative calculations.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a well-established quantum field theory. I know that in QED, when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent results, which is why renormalization is necessary. Regularization is a part of the renormalization process. So QED
