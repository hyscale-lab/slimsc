Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. I'm supposed to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r, so the answer is probably about a relationship between N and r.

Okay, parallax. I remember that parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula that relates parallax to distance is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. Wait, no, more precisely, plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So, plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

But the problem gives N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let's substitute d in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then plx is 1/d. So 1/plx^5 would be (d)^5. Because plx is 1/d, plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx)^5 is d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. But since plx is 1/d, this becomes N = k * (d)^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So perhaps we need to express N as a function of d and then find how it scales with r, where r is the distance.

Wait, wait. The problem says "per unit range of
