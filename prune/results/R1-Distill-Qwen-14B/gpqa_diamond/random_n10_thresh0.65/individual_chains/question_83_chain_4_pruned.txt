Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about titrating diluted acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So first, I think I need to calculate the new concentration after dilution. Oh right, because when you mix two solutions, the moles stay the same but the volume increases.

Wait, so the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. The molarity is moles per liter. So moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters.

Then, we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³, or 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so when you dilute it, it dissociates more. But for calculating the initial pH, we might need the concentration after dilution.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, the 25% titration point is when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. But wait, no, I think the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added. Because sometimes titration percentages are based on the volume of titrant used relative to the equivalence point volume.

Wait, the problem says "at 25% titration". Hmm. So perhaps, it's when 25% of the required NaOH to reach the equivalence point has been added. Or maybe it's when 25% of the acid has been neutralized. I'm a bit confused about this part.

Alternatively, perhaps the 25% refers to
