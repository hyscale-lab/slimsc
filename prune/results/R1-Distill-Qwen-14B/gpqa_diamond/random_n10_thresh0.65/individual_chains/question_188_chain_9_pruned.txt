Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. The options are A to D, with some numbers around 9 to 10 Angstroms.

I remember that interplanar distance in crystals is calculated using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. For a cubic crystal, the formula is straightforward, but rhombohedral is a bit more complex because the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees.

Wait, rhombohedral means that all the edges are equal, but the angles can be different. But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So it's a special case of a rhombohedral, maybe even a primitive or a face-centered structure? Hmm, not entirely sure, but I think for the purpose of this calculation, the formula might be similar to the general case.

I recall the general formula for interplanar spacing (d_hkl) in a crystal. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cosβ + hl cosγ + kl cosα) )) ) but wait, I'm mixing something up. No, wait, in a cubic system, cos terms are zero because angles are 90 degrees, but for a rhombohedral, the angles matter.

Wait, no, maybe the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos α + kl cos β) ) )? Or was it +2(...) instead of minus? I think I need to get the correct formula right here.

Alternatively, I've heard about the use of the reciprocal lattice. The interplanar distance d is given by 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos α + kl cos β)/(a^2). Wait, but I'm not confident. Maybe I should look up the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another thought: For a rhombohedral lattice,
