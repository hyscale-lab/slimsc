Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So, the question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. They have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits. The host stars are interesting—Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time.

Wait, so the question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the planet's orbital distance. But wait, isn't it more about the orbital distance relative to the star's size? Oh right, the formula I think is something like (R_star + R_planet) over the semi-major axis, but since the orbits are circular, it's just the semi-major axis. So the probability P is roughly (R_star) / (a) multiplied by some factor involving the inclination, but since we're comparing probabilities, maybe the relative factors are what matter.

But wait, the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but in this case, both have the same mass. So I don't think the planet's mass affects the transit probability directly. It's more about the orbital size.

So the key factors for transit probability are the orbital period (which relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law) and the size of the star.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis divided by the mass of the star. So the formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_star + m_planet)) * a³. But since the planets are Earth-like, their mass is much smaller than the star's, so M_star + m_planet ≈ M_star.

So for a planet with period P around a star of mass M, the semi-major axis a is approximately (G*M*(P/(2π))²) )^(1/3). Wait, let me get the exact formula. Kepler's third law is usually stated as a³ = (G(M + m) P²)/(4π²). Since m is much smaller than M, it's a³ ≈ (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

Wait, but in this problem, Planet_1 has P1 = (1/3) P2. Let's denote P2 as P, so P1 is P/3. And the mass of Planet_1's star is twice that of Planet_2's. So M1 = 2 M2.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

a1³ ∝ (M1) * (P1)² = (2 M2) * (P² / 9) = (2/9) M2 P².

a2³ ∝ (M2) * (P)² = M2 P².

So a1³ / a2³ = (2/9 M2 P²) / (M2 P²) ) = 2/9. So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculating (2/9)^(1/3): 2 is about 0.222 times 9, so cube root of 2/9 is cube root of (2)/(3^2) = cube root (2/27) ≈ 0.436. So a1 ≈ 0.436 a2.

Wait, but wait. That means Planet_1 is much closer to its star. So a is smaller for Planet_1.

Transit probability is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on. But the probability itself depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Or more precisely, the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * something, but I think the exact formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (m_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) ) ) ... but wait, no, actually, the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a.

Wait, actually, the probability of a transit is roughly (R_*/a), where a is the semi-major axis. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star, which has a certain size. So the probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance.

But wait, in more detail, the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a. But as R_planet is much smaller, especially for Earth-like planets, we can ignore it. So P ≈ (R_star / a).

But in our case, both stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2.

So transit probability for Planet_1 is (R1 / a1), and for Planet_2 is (R2 / a2) = (R1/a2).

But R1 is same for both, so P1/P2 = (R1/a1) / (R1/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 is 0.436 a2, a2/a1 is about 1/0.436 ≈ 2.29.

Wait, so P1 is about 2.29 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, but I thought the probability decreased as a increases because the denominator (a) is larger. But in this case, a1 is smaller, so R/a is larger for Planet_1.

So the higher probability is for Planet_1. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options: option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. Option D says 2.7 times.

Wait, but according to my calculation, P1/P2 is about 2.29. So none of the options mentions that, but the options are A to D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Let me redo it more carefully.

Given:

- M1 = 2 M2
- P1 = (1/3) P2

Using Kepler's third law:

a^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (4 π² )

But for each planet:

a1³ = (G (2 M2) (P1)^2 ) / (4 π² )

= (G (2 M2) ( (P2/3) )^2 ) / (4 π² )

= (G (2 M2) P2² / 9 ) / (4 π² )

a2³ = (G M2 (P2)^2 ) / (4 π² )

So a1³ = [ (2/9) ] * a2³

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 is approximately 0.2222. Cube root of 0.2222.

We know that 0.6³ = 0.216. So 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is just under 0.2222. So cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.6 + a bit.

0.6^3 = 0.216

0.61^3 = 0.61 * 0.61 = 0.3721; 0.3721 * 0.61 ≈ 0.2269. So 0.61^3 is about 0.2269.

But 0.2222 is between 0.6^3 and 0.61^3.

So 0.2222 - 0.216 = 0.0062. The difference between 0.6 and 0.61 is 0.01 in cube, 0.0062 is about 0.0062/0.0099 (since 0.61^3 - 0.6^3 ≈ 0.0103) ) so about 0.606.

So (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.608.

So a1 ≈ 0.608 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.608 ≈ 1.645 a1.

Then, the transit probability for each is P = R_star / a.

Since R1 = R2 = R, P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/a2.

So P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1 = 1.645.

So P1 is about 1.645 times higher than P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher by approximately 1.65 times.

Looking back at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. So option C is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Am I sure about the formula? Because sometimes the transit probability is given as R_star/(a) multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned, which I think is 1/(1+ (M_star/m_planet)^(1/3) ), but wait no, that's the probability that the RV method detects the planet. Wait, RV method's detection probability depends on the mass and orbital period, but transit probability is just geometrical.

The transit probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet)/a * (1 / (1 + (M_star/m_planet)^(1/3)) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough, which is roughly (R_star / a) * (something). But I think for the purpose of this question, the correct approach is to consider the semi-major axis and the star's radius.

So, yes, because a1 is smaller, R/a is larger, so probability is higher. So Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Now, looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both planets orbit stars of the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), so the key factor is the semi-major axis \( a \).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \), we calculate the semi-major axes for the two planets:

1. **Planet_1**:  
   - Orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} P_2 \)  
   - Host star mass \( M_1 = 2 M_2 \)  
   - \( a_1^3 \propto (2 M_2) \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2 \)

2. **Planet_2**:  
   - Orbital period \( P_2 \)  
   - Host star mass \( M_2 \)  
   - \( a_2^3 \propto M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \)

Taking the ratio of the semi-major axes:  
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{\frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]  
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.608
\]  
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.608 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis:  
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.608} \approx 1.645
\]  
This indicates that Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

Given the options, the correct choice is that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting.
