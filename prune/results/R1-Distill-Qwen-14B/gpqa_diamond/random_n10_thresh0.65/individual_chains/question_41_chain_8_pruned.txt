Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, the question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because I know that in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer, right? Here, the glass is moving. So does the movement of the glass affect the speed of light inside it from the lab's perspective?

I remember something about relativity here. So maybe I should think about this using special relativity. Because if the medium is moving, the speed of light as measured in the lab frame might change.

But wait, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame, right? But here, the light is in a medium, not a vacuum. So the medium's motion might affect how we perceive the light's speed.

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. Does the velocity of the medium add to the light's velocity?

Wait no, because when you have a medium moving, the speed of light within it as measured in the lab frame isn't just the sum or
