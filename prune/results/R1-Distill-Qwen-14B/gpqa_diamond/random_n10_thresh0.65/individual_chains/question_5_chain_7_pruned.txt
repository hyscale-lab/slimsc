Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors and eigenvalues can get a bit tricky. But I'll try to take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this are often related to angular momentum, maybe spin here since the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, typical for spin-1/2 particles like a muon.

The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. I think I can write each component matrix down:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane would be a combination of these components. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be represented by an angle θ from the z-axis. So I think the operator P is given by:

P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. Wait, no, wait. The x-z plane is the plane where y=0, but direction vectors in 3D space can have any components as long as they lie in the x-z plane. Wait, no, the x-z plane is spanned by x and z axes, so any vector in that plane can be expressed as having components in x and z, but y component is zero. So n_y = 0. So the operator becomes:

P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z

Wait, but wait. The direction vector n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. That makes sense.

So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Alternatively, sometimes people parameterize in terms of the x-z plane angle as θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So substituting:

P = (sin
