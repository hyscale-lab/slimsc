Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again and break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Titanium (Ti) in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is.

Hmm, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Oh, but the effective temperature changes. So when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower—5500 K instead of 6000 K. 

Wait, but wait a second. Spots are cooler regions, right? So when spots cover part of the star's surface, the overall Teff measured from the star's light would decrease because a part of the surface (which is emitting less) is contributing. But the photosphere of the spots themselves is at a lower temperature than the rest. But in this problem, when the spots are present, the overall photospheric temperature is given as 5500 K.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think the overall effective temperature is the average of the entire star's surface emission. So when spots are present, the average T drops. So the star's photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise
