Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. So Clemmensen is for reducing ketones to alkanes, right? Because it's a strong reducing agent. So if Compound X has a ketone group, that would be reduced.

Now, looking at the spectroscopic data for Compound X. Let's break down the IR and NMR.

Starting with the IR:
- The IR shows a strong peak around 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or maybe an ester or acid. But then looking at the other peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹. These are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring. The 1720 is probably a ketone since if it were an acid, the O-H stretch would be broader and maybe around 2500-3000. But wait, the IR also shows a peak in 3400–2500, which might include an O-H stretch. Hmm, but a ketone doesn't have O-H. So maybe it's an acid. Wait, but the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak which for an acid might not be as high. Or maybe it's a carbonyl from something else.

Wait, another possibility: the peak at 1720 could be an ester. But esters also have O-H if they're free, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone in the compound.

Now looking at the NMR. Let's list the peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but more upfield. Wait, no, aldehydes are around 9-10, but 10.5 is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like an O-H in a phenol, but again, phenols usually have broad peaks around 5-8 ppm, but maybe more deshielded? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxy
