Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. I remember that operators in quantum mechanics are often represented by matrices, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors have physical significance, like possible outcomes of measurements and the states they correspond to.

The problem states that Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I need to write out what Ay looks like. Let me compute that.

So, c is h/(4π). And S is:
[0   -i]
[i    0]

So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. That means each element of S is multiplied by c. So,

Ay = [ (h/(4π))*0 , (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
       [ (h/(4π))*i , (h/(4π))*0 ]

Which simplifies to:

Ay = [ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
       [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Alternatively, since c is h/(4π), I can write Ay as c * S.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let's set up the matrix (Ay - λ I). That would be:

[ -λ , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating the determinant:

λ² - [ (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the term inside the brackets is (1) * (h²)/(16 π²). So the equation becomes:

λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0

So, λ² = (h²)/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4 π). Hmm, so the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but wait, because I thought of the matrix S, which is like the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, wait, the S matrix here is actually similar to the Pauli X and Y matrices. Wait, let me think.

Wait, another approach. Since S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], that looks familiar. Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Exactly. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is usually denoted as σ_y. So, S = σ_y.

And the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ± ħ/2, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, no. Wait, each Pauli matrix (σ
