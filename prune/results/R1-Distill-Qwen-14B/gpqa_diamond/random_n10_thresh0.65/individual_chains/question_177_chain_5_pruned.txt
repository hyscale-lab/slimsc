Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Alright, let's read the question again carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's radiation is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Interesting.

Wait, but wait a second. Star_1 and Star_2 have the same peak wavelength, so same temperature. But their masses and radii are different. So mass isn't directly affecting the temperature here? Because temperature is tied to the star's properties in a different way. Like, for main-sequence stars, more massive stars are hotter and bigger. But here, the stars have same temp, but different size and mass? Hmm, maybe they're not main-sequence stars or perhaps they're in a different stage. But maybe that's not too important for solving this problem. The key is that their temperatures are the same.

The problem also states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. So Star_1 is at rest relative to us (radial velocity 0), and Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. Wait, but how does
