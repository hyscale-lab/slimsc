Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay length depends on how long they live on average before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the longer the decay distance if they're moving quickly. But wait, mean lifetime relates to the decay width. Oh right, the relation between the width Γ and the mean lifetime τ is given by the uncertainty principle. I think the formula is τ = ħ/(Γ), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, Γ is the decay width, which is the energy width of the particle's resonance. So the decay width is related to the inverse of the lifetime.

But wait, particles can't just decay if they're moving; their speed affects how far they go. So the mean decay distance L is the product of the velocity v and the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ. But wait, v depends on the energy and mass of the particle. Since mesons are bosons, maybe they're like pions or something similar, so their velocity can be calculated relativistically.

Wait, but the production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. The mass is 1.2 GeV, so this is a high
