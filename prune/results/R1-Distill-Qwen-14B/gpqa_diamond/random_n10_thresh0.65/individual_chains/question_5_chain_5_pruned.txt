Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think. The operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are often used for spin operators. Oh right, the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z correspond to the spin components. So P must be related to the Pauli matrices here. Let me check: the X-component, P_x, is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0 1] and second [1 0]. Oh yeah, that's the Pauli X matrix, σ_x. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y, which is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is σ_z.

The operator in question is P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, so the direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. That means the direction vector n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. Also, because it's a direction, n should be a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

The general form of the spin operator along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the Pauli vector with the direction vector. So the operator P should be (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Oh wait, or wait, because the direction is arbitrary, but n is a unit vector, so maybe n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) or something like that. But in this case, since it's in x-z plane, φ is zero, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since it's a unit vector, sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. Alternatively, maybe I should just write the operator as P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), where n_x² + n_z² =1.

Wait, but the question says the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/
