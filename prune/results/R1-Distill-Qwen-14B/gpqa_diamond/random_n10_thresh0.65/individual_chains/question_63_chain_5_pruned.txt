Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum states. Hmm, let me think. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, no, the non-rigid rotor is a different model, maybe this is the rigid rotor plus vibration? Or maybe it's the rotation-vibration coupling model. Hmm, but the problem specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model, so I think it's considering both rotation and vibration modes.

Wait, but the question is about the molecule switching to the next state. So it's probably transitioning from the ground state to an excited state. But what's the next state in terms of quantum numbers?

In the rigid rotor model (which is a simple model for rotation), the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. The ground state is J=0. The next state would be J=1, so the energy difference would be B*(1)(2) - B*0 = 2B.

But wait, the problem also mentions the vibration model. Oh, right, molecules can vibrate as well. The quantum harmonic oscillator model is used for vibrations, where the energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h Î½, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The ground state is n=0, and the first excited state is n=1, leading to
