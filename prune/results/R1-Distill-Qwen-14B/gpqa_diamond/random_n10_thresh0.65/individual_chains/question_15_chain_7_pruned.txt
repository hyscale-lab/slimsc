Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, and I need to choose between the options A to D. Let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, more specifically, the transit probability is highest when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But since the question says both planets have circular orbits and the RV method has already detected them, their orbital planes are known to some extent.

Wait, the RV method determines the mass of the planet and the period, but the inclination of the orbit is only known in terms of the minimum mass because the RV method can't determine the exact inclination. Hmm, but wait, the question says they've already detected the planets via RV, so maybe that gives some info about their orbital planes? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me get back to the basics.

The probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_planet + R_star) / a * (something else?), wait no, the formula I remember is P â‰ˆ (R / a), where R is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, the probability is actually the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit (in a certain direction) to the star's size. So the probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is such that it
