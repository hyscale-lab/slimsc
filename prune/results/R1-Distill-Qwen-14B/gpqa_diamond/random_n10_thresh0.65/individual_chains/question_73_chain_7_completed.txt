Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me read the question again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their velocities when they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. Oh right, I remember that you can't just do v1 - v2 because of the effects of relativity. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the values. Here, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So the numerator is (0.6c - 0.5c) which is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that denominator.

Calculating the denominator: 0.6 *0.5 is 0.3, multiplied by c² gives 0.3c². Divide that by c², so it's 0.3. So the denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Which is approximately 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now the total energy part. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him. v²/c² is (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. Gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v²/c² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.866. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. His energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 mc². So that's approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, but the options say E=5.96 mc² for option C and E=5 mc² for option D. So the correct energy is around 5.96, which matches option C.

Looking back at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That seems right. So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to find the relative speed between the two astronauts:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]
Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]
Rounding to two decimal places, \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.9641m c^2
\]
Rounding to two decimal places, \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy of the system is \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
