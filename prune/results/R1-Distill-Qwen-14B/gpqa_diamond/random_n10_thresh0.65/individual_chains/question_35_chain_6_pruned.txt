Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, muons are just like electrons but heavier, right? But anyway, focusing on the problem.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. I remember that Pauli matrices often look like this, but I'm not sure if S is a Pauli matrix or something else. Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches S here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, right?

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. But before getting into that, maybe I should recall how to find eigenvalues for a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of a matrix M are found by solving det(M - λI) = 0, where λ are the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

So, A_y is c multiplied by S. Let me write out the matrix A_y. Since S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then A_y would be c times that. So,

A_y = [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I'll set up the characteristic equation. The matrix minus λ I is:

[[-λ, -i c],
 [i c, -λ]]

The determinant of this should be zero. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Calculating the product (-i c)(i c): (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) because i² is -1. So that's 1. Then multiply by c squared, so it's c² * 1.

So the determinant equation becomes λ² - (c²) = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ±c.

Wait, c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So their real parts are ± h/(4π), but what about the imaginary parts? Since the eigenvalues are real, the imaginary parts are zero. Hmm, but looking at the options, let's see which ones fit.

Option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h
