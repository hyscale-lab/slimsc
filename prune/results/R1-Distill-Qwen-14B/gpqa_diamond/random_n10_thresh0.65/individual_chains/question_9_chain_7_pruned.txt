Okay, so I have this question about molecular symmetry and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, C3h symmetry... I remember that symmetry in molecules involves various types like Cn, Dn, Td, Oh, Ih, and others. Wait, C3h specifically refers to a molecule that has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane (σh) that includes the rotation axis. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

Let me look at the options. The molecules given are triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo... something, and a triphenyleno... something. The options are A, B, C, D, corresponding to these four.

First, let me recall what each molecule looks like.

Triisopropyl borate: Boron has three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are like two methyl groups attached to a central carbon. So triisopropyl borate would have three identical substituents around the boron. The structure is trigonal planar because boron has three bonds. So each isopropyl is a bulky group. Now, in terms of symmetry, if all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, the molecule should have C3 symmetry. Wait, but does it have a mirror plane? Let me think. C3 symmetry means if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, it looks the same. For triisopropyl borate, the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically. So the molecule is symmetric upon 120-degree rotation, which is C3. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane (σh)? I think in triisopropyl borate, since all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, there should be a mirror plane each bisecting the angle between two substituents. Wait, no, wait. The plane that includes the boron and is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule would be a mirror plane. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of whether it's nonpolar. If it has a center of inversion, that's another matter, but C3h requires a C3 plus a horizontal mirror.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate only has C3 symmetry and no mirror plane. Wait, no. Wait, I think that in a trigonal planar molecule with three identical
