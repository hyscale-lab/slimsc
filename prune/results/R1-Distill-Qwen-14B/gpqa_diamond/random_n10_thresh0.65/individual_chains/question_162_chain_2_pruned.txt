Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

First, I remember that in general relativity and differential geometry, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. The given metric here is:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. So, I'm probably dealing with a 2D surface, maybe like a sphere or something similar.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a tractricoid. But sometimes 'pseudosphere' is used in different contexts, so I should be careful.

Wait, but the metric given seems to be in coordinates x and y, but the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That reminds me of the metric for a sphere. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in 3D is often written with terms like (a² - x² - y²) or something similar. Wait, but in this case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that the radius squared is 4, so radius 2. Oh wait, because 4 is 2 squared. So maybe this is a coordinate system that's like a sphere's polar coordinates or something.

Wait, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, so the line element depends on the inverse of (4 - x² - y²). Let
