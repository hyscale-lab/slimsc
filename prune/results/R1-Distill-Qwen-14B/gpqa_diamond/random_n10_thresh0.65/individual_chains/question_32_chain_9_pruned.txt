Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Wait, that's a bit specific. I think Lithium usually has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

So the task is to find the energy required for this Li-6 nucleus to be moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations. So I better think about relativistic energy.

Wait, relativistic energy... I think the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared, right? Where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

First, I need to compute gamma for v =0.96c. Let's calculate that. Let me set v =0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me calculate that. Hmm, square root of 0.0784. Well, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714... Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is about 3.5714. Let me note that as gamma ≈ 3.5714.

But wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 0.28 is 28/100. So 1/0.28 is 100/28 ≈ 3.57142857. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the next step is to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Because the energy will be gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So the rest mass energy is m*c², and then multiplied by gamma gives the total energy.

What's the mass of Li-6? Let me think. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 can be found in periodic tables. Let me recall that the atomic mass of Li is approximately 6.941 g/mol. Wait, no, that's the atomic weight. But wait, each Li atom has an atomic mass of about 6.941 u, where u is the atomic mass unit. But wait, the exact mass of Li
