Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These divergences are a problem because they don't give meaningful physical results. So regularization is a way to handle these infinities, maybe by introducing a cutoff or something.

Wait, but which theories don't need regularization? I think that some theories are "finite," meaning they don't have these divergences, so they don't require regularization. Or maybe they have a different way of handling things.

Quantum Electrodynamics, QED, is a theory I know a bit about. I remember that QED does require renormalization because of divergences in loop calculations. But does it require regularization specifically? I think regularization is part of the renormalization process. So QED does use regularization methods, perhaps like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong force. It also has issues with divergences, especially with things like the running coupling. I think QCD does require regularization too, maybe using something like lattice regularization or other methods. Because of asymptotic freedom, perturbative methods are more manageable at high energies, but divergences still exist, so regularization is needed.

Superstring Theoryâ€”that's a theory of everything, right? It's a type of string theory. Strings are supposed to replace point particles, and perhaps string theories avoid some of the divergences that plague quantum field theories. Wait, I remember that in string theory, the higher-order terms that would give divergences in QFT are tamed because the theory is background-dependent and maybe the perturbative expansion isn't as divergent. Or could it be that string theory doesn't require regularization because the underlying theory is finite? Or maybe because it's a theory that works at all energy scales without needing cutoffs.

Classical Electrodynamics, option D, is the non-quantum version. Since it's classical, it doesn't involve the same divergences as quantum theories. In classical ED, you can have issues like the infinite self-energy of a charge, but when you quantize it, those problems become more significant. But in the classical theory, perhaps it's
