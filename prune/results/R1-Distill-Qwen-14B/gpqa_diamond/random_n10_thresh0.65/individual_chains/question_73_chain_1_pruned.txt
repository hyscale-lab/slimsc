Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember a bit about special relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Right, so I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, I should double-check that. Oh yeah, that's when both velocities are measured in the same reference frame. So in this case, the astronauts are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Let me compute that. Let me substitute the values: v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

So numerator is (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 -0.3=0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c when rounded. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a clue.

Next part is the total energy of the system. In relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of their rest masses. I think each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So each has their own gamma factor based on their speed.

Let me calculate each gamma. For the first astronaut (2m mass, speed 0.6c): gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0
