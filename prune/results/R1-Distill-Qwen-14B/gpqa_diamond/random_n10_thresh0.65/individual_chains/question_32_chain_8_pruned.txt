Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So with 3 neutrons, that would make it Lithium-6, I think. Because the atomic number is 3 (from Li), and mass number is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The problem gives me options for the energy, so I need to calculate the total energy of each nucleus when moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times its rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). 

First, I should find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, right? But wait, I think there's a more precise way. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0175863 u (unified atomic mass units), but wait, the actual value might be a bit different. Alternatively, I can look up the exact value. But since I'm doing this from memory, I'll proceed with the approximation.

Wait, another approach: each proton has a mass of about 1.007276 GeV/c², and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665). Let me calculate that.

3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = about 3.021828 GeV/c².
3 neutrons: 3*1.008665 = 3.025995 GeV/c².
Adding them together: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy m0c² is approximately 6.047823 GeV.

Wait, but actually, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 might be a little different. Let me think, I recall that the atomic mass is about 6.0175863 u. Oh wait, but when converting u to GeV/c², 1 u is approximately 931.523 MeV/c², which is 0.931523 GeV/c². So for Li-6, m0c² = 6.0175863 u * 0.931523 GeV/u. Let me compute that.
