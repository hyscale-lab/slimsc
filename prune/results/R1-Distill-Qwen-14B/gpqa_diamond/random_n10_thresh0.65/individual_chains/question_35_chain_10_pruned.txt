Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I need to find out which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, the matrix S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c in, that would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

I remember that angular momentum operators like S (since S is a spin-½ particle's operator) should have eigenvalues related to the spin. For a spin-½ particle, the possible eigenvalues of the components are ± ħ/2, but wait, wait. Wait, no, the eigenvalues for each component (like Sx, Sy, Sz) are actually ± ħ/2 multiplied by some factors. Let me think.

Wait, no, wait. The spin matrices for a spin-½ system are Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each with eigenvalues ±1. So Sx = (ħ/2) σx, Sy = (ħ/2) σy, etc. So the eigenvalues of Sx, Sy, Sz would be ± ħ/2.

But in this case, Ay is c multiplied by S, and c is h/(4π). Hmm, since ħ is h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ. Let me compute c in terms of ħ. c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). Oh, so c is ħ/2.

Wait, then Ay = c * S, which is (ħ/2) * S. But wait, S is the Pauli-Y matrix multiplied by ħ/2? Or is S the Pauli-Y matrix? Let me check. Because S is given as a 2x2 matrix, which looks like the Pauli-Y matrix. Because the Pauli Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so yes, that's S.

So S is the Pauli-Y matrix (σy), and Ay is (ħ/2) * σy. So the operator Ay is (ħ/2) times the Pauli-Y matrix. So when we talk about the eigenvalues of Ay, what would they be?

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σy has eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues of Ay will be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which gives ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. But wait, let's compute this numerically to be sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalues directly. The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * S, where S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So let's compute the matrix Ay.

First, compute the constants. h is Planck's constant, which is 6.
