Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound. The options are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O, C) C6H10O2, and D) C6H12O. Let me try to break down the information given step by step.

First, the FTIR data. They mentioned a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR usually correspond to O-H stretches. Broad because the hydrogen bonds cause a wide range of frequencies. So this suggests the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm.

The carbonyl group (C=O) typically absorbs around 1700 cm^-1. So a peak at 1700 is probably a carbonyl. The one at 1650 might be another group. Could it be an aromatic ring or conjugated double bonds? Or maybe an ester or another carbonyl group? Wait, 1650 is a bit lower than 1700. Maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a carbonyl group that's part of an aromatic system, like an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester with conjugation.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. They say there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, probably in an alkene or maybe part of a ring. So, maybe the compound has an alkene group and a carbonyl group, along with an O-H.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm trying to think about what gives a peak at 45. Common fragments... Let me think. The molecular ion might break down into smaller ions. 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is dimethyl ether, but that's 45 (12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 44? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me calculate: dimethyl ether is (CH3)2O. So molecular weight would be (2*15) + 16 = 30 +16=46. Oh, so that's m/z 46. Hmm. What about another possibility: a fragment with 45. Let's see, maybe a (CH2) group plus something else. Or perhaps an aldehyde? Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a ketone group or another functional group.

Wait, another approach: each option has a different formula, so maybe I can calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each to see which fits the data.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N here, the formula is (2C +2 - H - O)/2.

Let's compute DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 = (14 -14)/2 = 0/2=0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait,
