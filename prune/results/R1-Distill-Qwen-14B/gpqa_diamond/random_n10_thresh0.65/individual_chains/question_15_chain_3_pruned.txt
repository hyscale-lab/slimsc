Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Let me remember what I know about exoplanet transits and the factors that influence their probability.

Hmm, the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbital plane with our line of sight.

Wait, the probability (P) of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_planet + R_star) / a, but actually, I think I might be mixing it up. Oh right, no, that's not quite right. I remember it being more about the geometry. Oh wait, the probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Because the planet has to be in the right plane, so the chance is proportional to (R_*/a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again. Oh right, the transit probability is approximately (R_*)/(a) times the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. No, wait, more accurately, the probability is (R_*/a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is just right. But since the RV method has already found the planets, we know their minimum masses, but their actual masses could be higher. But for the purpose of transit probability, the main factors are the star's size, the planet's orbital distance, and the size of the planet relative to the star.

Wait, but in this question, I think the planet's size isn't given. Oh, wait, no, the question says both are Earth-like planets. So perhaps their radii are similar to Earth's, but since the host stars have similar radii, maybe the planet radius doesn't affect the transit probability as much as the star's radius and the orbital distance.

Wait, but the formula I remember is that the probability of a transit is roughly (R_*/a) * (something else), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read that the probability is proportional to (R_*/a), but I should think about it.

Wait, no, more accurately, the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula for the transit probability is (R_*/a)
