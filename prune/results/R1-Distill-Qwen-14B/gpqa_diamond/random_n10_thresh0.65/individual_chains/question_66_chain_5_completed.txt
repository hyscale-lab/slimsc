Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators must respect. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me recall what SMEFT is. SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible higher-dimensional operators that can modify the Standard Model (SM) interactions, respecting the same gauge symmetry as the SM. But beyond gauge symmetry, there are also other symmetries that the SM respects, and SMEFT operators should respect those as well, unless there's a specific reason not to.

The question is about which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

So, let's break down each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory. SMEFT operators are constructed from SM fields, and the interaction terms must preserve Lorentz invariance. So, any operator in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant. Otherwise, it would break this symmetry, which the SM already respects. Therefore, operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since the SM respects Poincare symmetry, SMEFT must as well. But wait, do all SMEFT operators automatically respect this? Because in SMEFT, you're adding higher-dimensional terms, which are suppressed by some scale (like Λ). But these terms are local, so they should still respect Poincare symmetry. Because if you have a term that breaks Poincare, like non-local operators, but SMEFT is a local effective theory. So yes, Poincare must be respected.

Wait, but wait a moment. Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. The SMEFT operators are local, so they should respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, hence Poincare. So option 2 is something they must respect.

3. CP Symmetry: The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in all cases. For example, CP violation is observed in the CKM matrix. So, the SM doesn't have CP symmetry as a fundamental symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. Some operators could violate CP, just like in the SM.

4. CPT Symmetry: The SM respects CPT symmetry. CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Any theory that respects quantum mechanics and the principles of Lorentz symmetry must respect CPT. Since SMEFT is built from terms that are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory, they should also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So, putting this together:

- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.
- Poincare symmetry (2) must also be respected.
- CP symmetry (3) does not have to be respected; SMEFT operators can violate it.
- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.

Looking at the options:

Option C says 1,2,4. That fits what I concluded.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C)1,2,4
D)1,3,4

So the correct answer would be option C, which includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

But wait, I should double-check Poincare. Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. Since SMEFT adds terms that are local, they should respect translation symmetry, so yes, Poincare is mandatory. So operators must respect all of Lorentz, translation (so Poincare), and CPT.

So the answer is option C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM) is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT operators are constructed from SM fields. Since these operators must preserve the symmetries of the SM, Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental requirement for all SMEFT operators.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. SMEFT is a local effective field theory, meaning its operators are local and respect translation symmetry. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry must also be preserved by all SMEFT operators.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not strictly respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is observed (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry either, as they can include terms that violate CP.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, must also respect CPT symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any theory consistent with quantum mechanics and Lorentz symmetry.

From this analysis, all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected, as SMEFT operators can include CP-violating terms.

**Correct Answer: C) 1,2,4**
