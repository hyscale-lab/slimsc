Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh, right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So, I think I should normalize this state first. Because when a state is given as proportional, we have to find the actual coefficients by dividing by the norm.

Wait, the norm squared is the sum of the absolute squares of the coefficients. So for the |up> term, the coefficient is (1+i). The absolute square is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For the |down> term, the coefficient is (2 - i), so the absolute square is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next part: the operator with matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 if iâ‰ j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is 2x2. Let me think. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the eigenstates would be the eigenstates of this operator. Wait, what does this matrix look like?

The operator matrix is:
[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because A12 and A21 are hbar/2, and A11 and A22 are 0. So this is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, what operator has this form? Oh, I think it's the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the given matrix is (hbar/2) * X.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the same as the eigenstates of X. The eigenstates of X are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator, which are |+x> and |-x>, the spin-up and spin-down in the x-direction. Alternatively, they can be expressed as superpositions of |up> and |down> states.

Wait, but in this problem, the operator's matrix is A, given as above. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
