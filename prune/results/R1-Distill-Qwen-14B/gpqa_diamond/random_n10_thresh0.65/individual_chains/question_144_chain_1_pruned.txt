Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance in particles usually refers to a state that doesn't live very long before decaying. Oh wait, the question is about the mean decay distance. I think that's related to how far the particle travels before it breaks down.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. So I need to find the mean decay distance.

I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is given by the uncertainty principle. Something like the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, since the options are in meters, I probably need to calculate the velocity of the particle and then multiply by the lifetime to get the distance.

Wait, but how do I get the velocity? I'll need the energy and mass to find the velocity. Oh right, using relativistic equations. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum. The energy squared is (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. I can solve for p, the momentum.

Let me jot that down. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². Let me compute p in units of GeV/c. So,

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2
=> (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2
Divide both sides by c²:
p² c² = E² - m² c^4
Wait, no, perhaps better to write in terms of E and m.

Let me compute E² - m² c^4. Wait, but units can be tricky here. Let's think in units where c=1, so E and m are in GeV, and we can compute E² and m².

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c² (but when c=1, m is 1.2 GeV). So:

E² = (8)^2 = 64 (GeV)^2
m² = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2
So E² - m² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

p² c² = (62.56) GeV². Wait, but I'm in units where c=1, so p is in GeV/c. Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, in natural units where c=1, E in GeV, m in GeV/c², and p in GeV/c. So E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4. So when c=1, E² = p² + m² c^4? No, wait, wait, the correct expression is E² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So in units where c=1, it's E² = p² + m².

So, p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) GeV/c.

Let me compute sqrt(62.56). 62.56 is 62.56, sqrt(62.56) is approximately 7.91 GeV/c.

So p ≈7.91 GeV/c.

Then, the velocity v can be found using beta = p c / E. Because beta = v/c = (pc)/E. Oh wait, E is in GeV, pc is GeV, so beta = (7.91 GeV/c) * c / (8 GeV) = 7.91/8 ≈0.98875. So beta is about 0.98875, which means v ≈ 0.98875 c.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Γ is the decay width, given as 320 MeV. But wait, units again. ħ has units of GeV·s, I think. Let me recall: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that would be the lifetime. Then, the mean decay distance is v * τ. So v is approximately 0.98875 c, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So distance L = v τ = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that:

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875e-16 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.98875: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ approx 6.105e-16 m? Wait, no, wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625 * 1e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then multiply by 0.98875: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875.

Compute 6.170625 * 0.98875 ≈ approximately 6.170625 * 0.98875.

Let me compute 6
