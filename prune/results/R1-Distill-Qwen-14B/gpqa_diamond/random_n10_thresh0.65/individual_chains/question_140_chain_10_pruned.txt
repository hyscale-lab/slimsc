Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. 

So the problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is close to 10°C, I think. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also a reagent.

The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. And the options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Wait, so I need to figure out what X is first. Because without knowing X, it's hard to find the elements involved.

Let me think about gas W. Its molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule's formula must be such that the sum of protons and neutrons in each molecule is equal.

Wait, wait. Each molecule. So, maybe it's a diatomic gas, like O2 or N2. Let's think: for O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since O is usually O-16). So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So in O2, each molecule has 16 protons (since 2 atoms × 8) and 16 neutrons (2×8). So yes, same number. So O2 would fit. Or maybe O3 or O something else, but O2 is more common as a gas.

Alternatively, another possibility: CH4? No, because CH4 has 1 C and 4 H. The protons would be 6 (C) + 4×1 (H) = 10. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (since carbon-12), H has 0. So each molecule would have 6 neutrons. Not equal to 10. So that doesn't fit.

Another possibility: NH3? No, but wait, that's a gas, but maybe not. Let me see. NH3 has 1 N and 3 H. Protons: 7 (N) + 3×1=10. Neutrons: N has 7
