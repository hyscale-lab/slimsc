Okay, so I have this question about planets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, both have the same mass. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3.

They both have circular orbits. The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but their radii are equal. Interesting. So Star_1 (hosting Planet_1) has mass M1 = 2*M2, where M2 is the mass of Star_2.

The transit probability depends on several factors. From what I remember, the probability that a planet transits its star is given by the formula: R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, there's another factor involving the inclination. Oh right, the transit probability is (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^0.5), but since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so the probability simplifies to R_star / a.

Wait, but how do we calculate the semi-major axis a? Oh, Kepler's third law. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P and the mass of the star M. The formula is a³ = (G(M + m) P²) / (4π²). Since the planet's mass m is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So a ≈ [ (G*M * P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3).

But wait, because both stars have the same radius, and the probability is R_star / a, but the stars have different masses. So let's get into the math.

So for each planet, the transit probability P_transit is proportional to R_star / a.

Given that R_star is the same for both (as per the question, both host stars have the same radius), the probability depends inversely
