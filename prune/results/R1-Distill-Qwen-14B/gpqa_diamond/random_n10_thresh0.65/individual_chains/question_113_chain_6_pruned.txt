Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through each part.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectra: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with C6H and varying O and H counts.

First, the FTIR part: very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually mean O-H groups. The broadness suggests it's not a single peak but a very broad one, which makes me think of either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, wait, another detail: two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm. 1700 is typically a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. 1650 might be an adjacent carbonyl, maybe conjugated? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with some substitution. Wait, another possibility: amide? No, the question doesn't mention N, so probably not.

Wait, but wait, the 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Oh, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have two carbonyl groups? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached, like in a substituted benzene. Wait, another thought: maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is something else, like an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Because aromatic C=C usually around 1600-1680. So if there's a peak at 1650, that might be the ring. But then the 1700 would be a carbonyl elsewhere. Like a ketone or ester.

Then, the NMR part says there are vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So the compound must have a double bond. That would fit with an aromatic ring, which has conjugated double bonds, but also maybe a vinyl group elsewhere.

Now, the Mass Spec part: fragment peak at m/z 45. 45 is a common mass. Let me think about what fragments give that. The molecular ion doesn't split into 45, but some other fragment. 45 could be a fragment like CH3CO+ (which is 43, so not exactly). Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's calculate possible fragments. Maybe a methyl group attached to something? Alternatively, think of a (CH3)2O, which is 45? Wait, (CH3)2O is 3*12 + 6*1 = 36 + 6? Wait, no: (CH3)2O is (2*15) + 16 = 30 +16=46? No, wait, 2*(CH3) is 2*(15) =30, plus O is 16. 30+16=46. So that's 46, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe a CH2O group? No, that would be 30. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COO-, which is the acetate ion. So maybe the compound has an ester group, which would break off as the acetate in the mass spec, giving m/z 45 as the fragment.

Wait, wait. Let me think of the possible structures. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Looking at the formulas, the degrees of unsaturation might help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N here, for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. So, (2*6 +2 -12 - 0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So 1 degree. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option B: C6H10O. (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. Two degrees: could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. (14 -10)/2 =2. Two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. (14-12)/2=1. One degree.

So, the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. So the molecule must have an O-H. That would point toward either an alcohol (like a phenol or an alcoholic OH) or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the FTIR also shows a peak at 1700, which suggests a carbonyl. So if there's a carbonyl
