Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, right? So that would make it Li-6. So the nucleus in question is Li-6.

The options given are A to D, with various GeV values. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, so I need to think through the steps carefully.

First, I remember that relativistic energy is given by the equation E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

Let me compute gamma. So v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, since 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28, which is 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need to find the relativistic energy, E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, what is m0? It's the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So I need to find the mass of Li-6 in appropriate units.

Li has an atomic number of 3. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so total of 6 nucle
