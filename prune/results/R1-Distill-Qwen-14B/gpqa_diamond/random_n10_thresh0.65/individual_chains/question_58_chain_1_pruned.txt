Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's read it again carefully.

The question is: Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies? The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those pesky infinities that pop up in calculations. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through each option.

Starting with option D, Classical Electrodynamics. That's the traditional Maxwell's equations, right? So it's a classical theory, not a quantum one. I think regularization is a quantum field theory concept. Since classical theories don't have the same divergences as quantum theories, maybe this is the one that doesn't require regularization. Because in the classical case, the calculations are finite, so no need to regularize.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the others just to make sure. 

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I remember that QED calculations often lead to divergent integrals, especially when dealing with things like electron self-energy or vacuum polarization. So they must use regularization techniques like introducing a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). That's the theory of the strong interaction. QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, where the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies (or short distances). But wait, doesn't that mean it's perturbatively manageable at high energies? Or does it still have divergences that need regularization? I think QCD loops also have divergences, so they probably use regularization methods too. Although, since it's a non-abelian gauge theory, maybe there's something different, but I think regularization is still needed.

Option A is Superstring Theory. String theories are supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity. I remember that string theories are background-dependent and require a lot of machinery, like the string tension, which might lead to different kinds of divergences. Also, string theories often require things like T-duality or other dualities, and they also deal with higher-dimensional objects. But do they require regularization? Wait, string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences as in QED or QCD. Because instead of point particles, they have strings, which might lead to better behaved theories. So maybe Superstring Theory doesn't require regularization. But wait, is that true?

Wait, some sources say that string theories have a more controlled ultraviolet behavior. They don't have the same divergences because the higher-order terms (like loop corrections) are finite when you compute them in string theory. So perhaps in superstring theory, you don't need to regularize because the theory is already finite at high energies.

So the question is which theory never requires regularization. The options are whether it's D, the classical one, or A, the superstring theory.

Wait, another angle: which theories are perturbative and which are not. QED and QCD are perturbative and require renormalization, which comes after regularization. But if a theory is non-perturbative, maybe it doesn't run into the same issues. But I
