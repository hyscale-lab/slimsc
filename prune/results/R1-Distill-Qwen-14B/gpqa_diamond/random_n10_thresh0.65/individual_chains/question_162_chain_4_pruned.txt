Okay, so I've got this question here about the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so the metric is written in terms of x and y. I remember that in 2D, the metric can be used to calculate areas, but I'm not entirely sure how it applies here. Oh wait, pseudosphere—probably a hyperbolic surface, right?

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere usually refers to a hyperboloid, but I'm not sure if it's a 1-sheeted or 2-sheeted one. Oh, but wait, pseudosphere is often used to describe surfaces with constant negative curvature. So I think it's a hyperbolic surface.

But how do I compute the area from the metric? I think I remember that the area can be found using the determinant of the metric tensor. So the metric tensor in this case is diagonal because the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the metric tensor components g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant would be the product of these two, right?

Wait, the metric is given as ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy², so the determinant is g_{xx} * g_{yy} because it's diagonal. So determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

But wait, the area of a surface in 2D is
