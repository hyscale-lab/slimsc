Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity inside has a radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, imagine a big sphere with a smaller hollow sphere inside, not exactly at the center, but shifted by s units.

There's a small positive charge +q placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are different expressions for E, the electric field at P. So, I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, from what I remember, when dealing with charges inside cavities of conductors, the conductor's properties and induced charges come into play. Oh right, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surface. Also, any enclosed charges would induce opposite charges on the inner surface and same on the outer. But wait, the conductor here is uncharged, so initially, there's no charge on it. But when we place a charge inside the cavity, that changes things.

So when we put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must induce a -q charge to cancel the field inside the conductor. But wait, wait
