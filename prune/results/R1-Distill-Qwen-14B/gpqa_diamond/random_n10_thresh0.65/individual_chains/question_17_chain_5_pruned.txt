Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the solution has a concentration of this complex. So, the question is about the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Wait, I think this is a solubility product problem, but it's about a complex ion. So the K given is probably the formation constant (Kf), which tells us how much the complex forms.

The formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. The general reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

And the Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

So in this case, the solution has 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2−. But because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, I think the complex is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, so the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But some of it might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but given that Kf is 5e10 (that's 5x10^10), which is a very large number. That suggests that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

So let's model it. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's assume that x amount dissociates.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Then, at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x. The concentration of Ca²+ would be x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x? Wait, no, because the stoichiometry is 1:1, so yes, each dissociation gives
