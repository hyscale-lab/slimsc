Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in terms of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's a very small distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.

Alright, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula, if I recall correctly, is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is the decay width, right? So the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. But wait, what's Γ here? Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of energy times time. Oh wait, actually, the units might get a bit tricky here.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Let me think about the units. The decay width Γ has units of energy. The Planck constant ħ has units of J·s, which in terms of energy is eV·s. So when I divide ħ by Γ, which is in eV, the units of τ will be seconds. That makes sense.

So first, I should compute the lifetime τ. Then, once I have the lifetime, I can find the decay distance by multiplying by the velocity. But wait, I don't have the velocity directly. Hmm, how do I get that?

Wait, the production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. Since E_X is much larger than the mass, the meson is moving relativistically. So I can probably use relativistic formulas here. The energy E of a particle is related to its mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So I can find the momentum p, and from that, get the velocity.

Wait, but the meson's mass is 1.2 GeV/c². E is given as 8 GeV, so let me compute p. Let's write the equation:

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2

Rearranging for p:

p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c²)^2) ) / c

But since E is much larger than m, maybe I can approximate p ≈ E / c. Because E>>m, so E² - m²c^4 ≈ E², so sqrt(E²) is E, so p ≈ E/(c). Wait, but E is in GeV, and c is in m/s. Hmm, maybe I can compute p in units that make sense.

Wait, let's compute p. Let me convert all units into consistent terms. Let's use natural units where c=1. Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, use SI units.

Wait, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². Let me convert that into kg. 1 GeV is approximately 1.60218e-10 J. So 1 GeV/c² = (1.60218e-10 J) / (9e16 m²/s²) ) = approx 1.78e-27 kg.

So m_X = 1.2 GeV/c² = 1.2 * 1.78e-27 kg ≈ 2.136e-27 kg.

E_X is 8 GeV. Converting that to Joules: 8 GeV = 8 * 1.60218e-10 J = 1.281744e-9 J.

Now, compute p:

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2

We can rearrange:

p c = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 )

So p = sqrt( (E/(c))^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, wait. Let me get the units right.

Actually, p c is sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2 ), so p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

Wait, let me compute E and m c² in the same units. Let me compute E² and (m c²)^2.

E = 8 GeV. m c² = 1.2 GeV (since m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², so m c² is 1.2 GeV). So:

E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV.

So,

E² - (m c²)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV^2.
