Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Interesting. The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. So Star_1 isn't moving towards or away from us, while Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.

The main question is about the luminosity ratio between the two stars. The astronomers computed that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a factor, and we have to choose which option is correct.

Alright, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. Luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I remember is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius squared multiplied by its temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πR²σT⁴, but since we're comparing two stars, the constants will cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴).

Wait, but the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies. So yes, that formula should apply.

Now, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's
