Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again and see what I can make sense of.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the reaction: X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and maybe some other products. The gas W has same neutrons and protons. So, each molecule of W has equal number of neutrons and protons. That likely means that W is a molecule where each atom has equal n and p. Wait, but wait, W is a gas, so probably a diatomic like H2O or CO2 or something else. Wait, no, wait. If each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, perhaps each molecule has the same number, but each atom in the molecule might have different. Or maybe each atom in the molecule has the same number of n and p, meaning they're the same isotope. Or perhaps the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons in total.

Wait, but gas W's molecule has same
