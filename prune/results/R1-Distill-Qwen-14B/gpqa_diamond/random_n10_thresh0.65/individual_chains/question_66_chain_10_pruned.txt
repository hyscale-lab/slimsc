Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1, 2, 3, 4, and the choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

So, what do I know about symmetries in physics? Well, the Standard Model has certain symmetries, and SMEFT should respect those unless modified by the new operators.

Looking at the options, the question is about which symmetries are "musts" for all operators. So which symmetries are fundamental and cannot be broken by any operator in SMEFT?

Option 1 is Lorentz symmetry. I think operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because, you know, the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is built upon it. If an operator doesn't respect Lorentz symmetry, it would probably lead to inconsistencies or violate basic principles like causality. So I think all SMEFT operators must preserve Lorentz symmetry.

Option 2 is Poincaré symmetry. Wait, Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. I remember that the Poincaré group includes translations (momentum generators) and Lorentz transformations. But SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which is typically formulated in a fixed background, maybe? Or perhaps SMEFT operators can involve terms that don't respect translations, like operators with higher mass dimension. Oh wait, SMEFT is based on the SM fields, which do respect Poincaré symmetry. But the effective operators, like dimension-6 operators, are local and constructed from SM fields, so perhaps they must respect Poincaré symmetry. Or maybe not? Wait, no, because effective field theories are usually defined in a way that respects Poincaré symmetry. Because otherwise, you couldn't have a Lorentz-invariant S-matrix. So I think SMEFT operators must respect Poincaré symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 are both needed.

Option 3 is CP symmetry. Hmm. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry; for example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So, if the SM already violates CP, then SMEFT operators can also
