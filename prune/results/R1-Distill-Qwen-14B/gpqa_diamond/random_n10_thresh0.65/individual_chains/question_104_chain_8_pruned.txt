Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to work through. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

Alright, so astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars with the same mass. Both stars have masses similar to the Sun. Each star has a planet, both about Neptune's mass. The planets are in circular orbits.

They used the radial velocity (RV) method to detect them. The RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. The shift in the spectral line tells us about the star's velocity.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. The data given is the periodic shift in wavelength for each star's spectral line.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms. Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is something like:

v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet))^(1/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3) )^(something). Maybe I should think about the relation between velocity and period.

Wait, I think the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) ) ]^(1/1) )

But since the eccentricity is zero (circular orbit), the equation simplifies.

Wait, but both planets are around stars of the same mass (like the Sun), and the planet masses are similar (Neptune, so much less than the star's mass). So M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So we can simplify.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet ) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1/(2π))^(something)? Wait
