Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me read the problem again carefully.

There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to P is L, and the distance from the center of the cavity to P is l. It's given that l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric charges and fields. Since the conductor is uncharged, initially, it has no net charge. But when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens?

Wait, I think the conductor's interior affects the distribution of charges. Oh right, when a conductor encloses a charge, the charges redistribute themselves. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. So the cavity is inside, and the conductor's material can have charges induced on its inner and outer surfaces. 

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor as a whole is neutral. So when +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge +q, because the total charge on the conductor is zero. Oh wait, wait no. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, so if the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity) must have -q induced. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because inner is -q, outer is +q, so sum is zero.

But wait, wait. The conductor is neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) must have a charge of -q, to cancel the field inside the conductor material. Because the conductor is a conductor
