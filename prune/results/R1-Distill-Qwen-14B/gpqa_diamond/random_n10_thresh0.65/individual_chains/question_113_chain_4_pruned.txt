Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to analyze each data point to narrow down the possibilities.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, wait, but different O-H groups have different absorption regions. Alcohols are usually around 3300-3500, broad, but maybe if it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol, the peak might be a bit lower and less broad? Or is that stretching? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe it's an O-H from a carbonyl compound, like a ketone with an alpha-H? No, wait, that's more like an enol or something else. Or perhaps it's an alcohol. But wait, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Those are in the range for carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a carbonyl, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The peak at 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with some conjugation or perhaps an amide? But wait, the options don't have N, so maybe it's something else.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the 1700 could be a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester, and the 1650 could be conjugated double bonds or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents. But I'm not sure. Let me think about possible structures. Oh, wait, the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. So the compound has a vinyl group, like a double bond. So maybe the 1650 cm^-1 is a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like a ketone next to a double bond. That would make sense because the IR would show the carbonyl around 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650.

So, if the compound has a carbonyl group and a vinyl group, perhaps it's something like an alpha,beta-uns
