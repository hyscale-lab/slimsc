Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and calculating the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think this through.

Wait, a rhombohedral crystal system has all sides equal and all angles equal. So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, a, b, c are all the same because it's a special case of both the cubic and hexagonal systems, I think. So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms.

The interplanar distance for a crystal plane (hkl) is given by the formula 1/d = sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cosθ)/(a²) - 2(hl cosθ)/(a²) - 2(kl cosθ)/(a²) ) ) where θ is the angle between the axes. Wait, no, I might have mixed something up. Another approach: the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal system is using the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices and their cosines. 

Wait, the formula is d_hkl = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cosγ) + 2(hl cosβ) + 2(kl cosα) ) ), but wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I'm getting confused because the formula might be different for rhombohedral systems. Let me think again.

In a general rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a cube with all edges equal but angles not necessarily 90 degrees. The interplanar distance for (hkl) in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )

But wait, for a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees here. So cos α = cos β = cos γ = cos(30°) which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So substituting, the denominator inside
