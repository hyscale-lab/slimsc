Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, okay, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric because it's only got dx and dy. So this is a 2-dimensional spacetime, maybe a surface in some higher-dimensional space?

I remember that metrics can describe the geometry of spacetime, and when you have a metric in 2D, you can compute things like area. In flat space, the area element would just be dx dy, but this isn't flat. The area element in a metric is computed using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, right?

The metric tensor here is diagonal, so the determinant should be the product of the (dx²) coefficient and the (dy²) coefficient. Wait, each of those terms is multiplied by [32 / (4 - x² - y²)], so the determinant would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². The square root of the determinant is then [32/(4 - x² - y²)].

So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. To find the total area, I need to integrate this over all x and y where the metric is defined. But where is this metric valid? The denominator 4 - x² - y² must not be zero, so x² + y² < 4, meaning the coordinates are within a circle of radius 2. Because at x² + y² =4, the denominator becomes zero, which would make the metric singular. So the domain is a disk of radius 2.

So the area A is the double integral over x and y of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy, where r² =x² + y². Switching to polar coordinates might make this easier. In polar coordinates, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So substituting that in, the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

I can separate the integrals since the integrand doesn't depend on θ. So it's the integral over θ times the integral over r.

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

The r integral is ∫0 to 2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr. Hmm, let's make a substitution. Let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so (-du/2) = r dr. Wait, but my integrand is (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) = (32 * (-du/2)) / u. Let me adjust the limits accordingly.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes from u=4 to u=0. But flipping the limits (since integrating from higher to lower is the same as integrating from lower to higher multiplied by -1), I can write:

∫ [32/(u)] * (r dr) = 32 * ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) * (-du/2). Which is the same as 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

Wait, no, let's correct that substitution. The substitution is:

u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)].

Substitute r dr = -du/2, so when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) ( -1/u ) du.

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me factor the constants out. The integral becomes 32 * [ (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du ].

Which simplifies to 32 * ( -1/2 ) * [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, and ln(4) is a finite number. So [ln(0) - ln(4)] is negative infinity minus a finite number, which goes to negative infinity. Multiplying by the constants, the integral would be 32 * (-1/2) * (-infinity) = positive infinity.

Wait, let's double-check that. Let's compute the integral ∫ (from a to b) (1/u) du. It's ln(b) - ln(a). So in our case, a is 4, b is 0. So ln(0) - ln(4)? Wait, no, it's [ln(b) - ln(a)] = ln(0) - ln(4) = -infinity - ln(4). So the integral is negative infinity.

So the integral becomes 32 * (1/2) * ( - [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] ) = 32*(1/2) * ( - ( -infinity - ln4 )) = 32*(1/2) * (infinity + ln4) → which is infinity.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's do it step by step. The original substitution:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r dr/(4 - r²)].

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ [ (r dr) / u ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ].

The limits when r=0 → u=4; r=2 →u=0.

So the substitution changes the integral to 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) [ ln(u) evaluated from 4 to 0 ].

That's 32 * (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so ln(0) - ln(4) is negative infinity minus a finite value, which is negative infinity. So the expression becomes 32 * (-1/2) * (-infinity) → which is 32*(1/2)*infinity = 16 * infinity → which is infinity.

So the integral over r becomes infinity. Therefore, the area A is 2π multiplied by infinity, which is infinity.

Wait, but the options don't have 'infinite' except option D which is +infty. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. The question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. I'm a bit confused. A pseudosphere is like a tractricoid, a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given here might be representing such a surface, but how does that affect the area?

Wait, I think I'm forgetting something about the metric's properties. The metric given is in 2D, but perhaps it's part of a higher-dimensional manifold. Oh, wait, in 2D, the area would just be the integral I computed, which is infinite. So the area is infinite, so the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a compact space, but looking at the denominator, 4 - x² - y², as x and y approach 2, the metric blows up. So the space is non-compact, and the integral diverges. So the area is infinite, hence option D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional spacetime. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we calculate the area element in this geometry. The area element \(dA\) is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor, which is proportional to \(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The metric is defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), meaning the coordinates are confined to a disk of radius 2. To find the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over this disk. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right).
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). Therefore, the total area is:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot \infty = +\infty.
\]

This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
