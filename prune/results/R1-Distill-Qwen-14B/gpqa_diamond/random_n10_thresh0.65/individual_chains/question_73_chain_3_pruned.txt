Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember a bit about special relativity, but I'm a bit rusty, so let me think this through.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed when dealing with relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Because at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory. So the relative velocity isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c, which would be 0.1c. Oh wait, but wait! The formula for relative velocity is different.

The formula for adding velocities in relativity, when you have two speeds u and v, is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). But wait, in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be the difference between their velocities, but using the relativistic formula.

Let me get that straight. If astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c and astronaut B at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction (let's say the positive x-direction), then from A's frame, B's speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the velocity of an object from one frame to another is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), but that's when the frames are moving at speed v relative to each other.

Wait, no, sorry, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the correct formula. The relative velocity of object B as observed from object A's frame is calculated using the formula (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of A relative to the lab frame and v is the speed of B relative to the lab frame. Wait, but wait a second. Actually, in the lab frame, A is moving at u =0.6c, and B is moving at v=0.5c. So from A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait: in this scenario, since both are moving in the same direction, A is moving faster than B. So in the lab frame, from A's perspective, B would be moving backward, right? Because B is going slower than A. So their relative speed would be (A's speed - B's speed) but using the relativistic formula.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction in the lab frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Because the relative velocity is (u - v), but adjusted by the Lorentz factor.

Wait, no, no. The general formula for the relative velocity is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is
