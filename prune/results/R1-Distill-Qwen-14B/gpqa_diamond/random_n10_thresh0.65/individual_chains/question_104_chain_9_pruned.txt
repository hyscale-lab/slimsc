Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. So, let's read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with exactly the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The question is about comparing the orbital periods of the two planets based on the observed spectral line shifts.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit (but since both are circular and we're talking about detected planets, I guess the inclination isn't a factor here, maybe we can assume it's the same or it's not needed? Or perhaps it's not given, so maybe we can ignore it for this calculation).

Wait, the formula for RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. Alternatively, the formula I recall is:

K = ( (2πG) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So, K ≈ ( (2πG) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_* )^(2/3) )

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe think
