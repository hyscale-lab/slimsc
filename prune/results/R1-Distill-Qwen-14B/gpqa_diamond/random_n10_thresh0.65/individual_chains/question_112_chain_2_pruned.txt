Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and also calculating the average value of an operator. Alright, let's start by understanding what's given.

The state of the electron is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's a scalar multiple. So I think I should normalize this state first. Because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes, right?

So first, let me write the state vector. The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator, which means they form an orthonormal basis. So the state |alpha> can be written as a vector in this basis. Let me denote the coefficients:

Coefficient of |up> is (1+i), coefficient of |down> is (2 - i). To find the normalization, I need to compute the inner product of the state with itself.

The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i). Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Actually, it's the sum of the modulus squared of each coefficient. So modulus squared of (1+i) is (1^2 +1^2) = 2, and modulus squared of (2 -i) is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5. So total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), making |alpha> equal to [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). So the state is normalized.

Now, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij. The operator's matrix is such that A_ij = hbar/2 if iâ‰ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the size of this matrix? Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the Hilbert space is two-dimensional. So the matrix is 2x2, with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

So the matrix looks like this:
[ 0,   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, because in the basis |up> and |down>, the operator's matrix has 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So the matrix is:
[0, hbar/2;
hbar/2, 0 ]

Ah, so this operator is actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2.
