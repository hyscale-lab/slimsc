Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom. Wait, no, wait—wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, which in crystals is the lattice parameter. So in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by a single parameter, a, and all edges are equal, right? So a is 10 Angstrom here.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Hmm. So it's a rhombohedral crystal with all angles at 30 degrees. I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles between them are equal too. So this makes sense.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is d_hkl, which is given by the formula derived from the crystal planes. The formula I think is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma. So the formula can be simplified. Let me think again. Alternatively, I remember that in a cubic system (which is a special case of rhombohedral where angles are 90 degrees), the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But here, the angles are 30 degrees, so it's not cubic.

Alternatively, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the Miller indices are (hkl), and the interplanar distance is given by d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the edges in the lattice. Since all angles are 30 degrees, θ=30.

Wait, but wait—the formula I'm trying to recall for d_hkl in a rhombohedral system. Let me think. The general formula for d_hkl in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

1/d² = (h²)/(
