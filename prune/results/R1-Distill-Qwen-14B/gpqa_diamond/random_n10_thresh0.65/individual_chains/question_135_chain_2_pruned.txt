Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of this boson X. The problem gives me the interaction Lagrangian and the mass of X as 6 GeV. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I should parse that correctly. Oh right, the interaction term is probably something like λ X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning that the boson X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So X can decay into fermion and antifermion pairs.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. To find allowed decays, I need to consider which fermion pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because for a decay to happen, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

Let me list the possible fermions and their masses. Wait, but wait, I should remember that in particle physics, the masses I'm considering here are the rest masses. So, for each fermion-antifermion pair, the total rest mass is 2m_fermion.

So the possible fermions we're looking at are quarks and leptons. Let's list their masses roughly:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, like ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Also, neutrinos are super light, but since they are neutral, maybe they can be produced in pairs, but I don't think the Lagrangian has a coupling to neutrinos because the term is X ψ ψ, and neutrinos are left-handed in the Standard Model, but perhaps only charged fermions are considered here.

So the possible fermion pairs are quarks (u, d, s, c, b) and leptons (e, μ, τ).

But wait, the interaction term is for fermions ψ_f. Let me think: the term is X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning that X couples to each fermion species separately. So for each fermion type, X can decay into that fermion and its antiparticle.

But wait, the problem is about bosonic field X, so any fermion pair that can be produced from X must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me compute 2m_f for each fermion:

- e: 2 * 0.5 MeV = 1 MeV → way below 6 GeV
- mu: 2 * 105 MeV = 210 MeV → 0.21 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV
- tau: 2 * 1.78 GeV =
