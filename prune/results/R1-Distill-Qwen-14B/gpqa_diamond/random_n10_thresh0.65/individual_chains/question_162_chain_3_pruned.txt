Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Oh wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric because it only involves dx and dy. I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor tells us about the geometry of spacetime, but here we're probably dealing with a 2D surface.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like, it's a hyperbolic surface. But wait, sometimes it's also called a tractricoid, which is the surface formed by rotating a tractrix. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The problem is to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So, area would involve integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in a metric is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. Wait, but since this is 2D, the area element would be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor.

Let me write this metric in matrix form. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²), so the matrix g would be diagonal with both components equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant det(g) is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

Therefore, the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So sqrt of [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So, dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but wait, the determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal elements. So yes, the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², and the square root gives 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area is the integral of dA over the region where the metric is defined.

Now, I need to find the limits of x and y. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so for the metric to be real and non-singular, 4 - x² - y² must be positive. Because if it's zero or negative, we'd have a problem. So 4 - x² - y² >0 → x² + y² <4. So the region is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

So the area would be the integral over all x and y such that x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, but integrating this might be tricky. Let me think about switching to polar coordinates because the region is a circle and the integrand looks radial symmetric.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so x² + y² = r². The Jacobian determinant for polar coordinates is r. So the integral becomes the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π.

So putting it all together, the area A is:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

We can separate the integrals since the integrand doesn't depend on θ. So,

A = ( ∫0^{2π} dθ ) * ( ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr )

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

The r integral is ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(u)] dr = 32 ∫ (u=4 to 0) [1/u] (-du/2) )

Wait, because r dr = -du/2, so the integral becomes 32 * ∫ [1/u] * (-du/2) → but the limits switch from 4 to 0.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to flip the limits:

= 32 * (1/2) ∫ (u=0 to 4) (1/u) du )

Wait wait, let me correct that.

Original substitution:

u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 → 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (
