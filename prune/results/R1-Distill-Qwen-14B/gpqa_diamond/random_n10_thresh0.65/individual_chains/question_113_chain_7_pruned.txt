Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying a compound using various spectroscopic techniques. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question mentions the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's look at each of these pieces of data one by one and see what they tell us about the structure.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. For example, alcohols or carboxylic acids have O-H stretches. But wait, wait. The peak is very broad. Carboxylic acids typically have a very broad and strong O-H stretch because the protons are more acidic and easily dissociate. Alcohols usually have a narrower peak, but it can still be broad. Another possibility is an -NH stretch, but that's more around 3300-3500 and might be less likely here. So the broad peak suggests either an -OH group or maybe a carbonyl group with some hydrogen bonding, but I'm more inclined towards an -OH because of the broadness.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1700 peak is usually indicative of a ketone or aldehyde, maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or maybe an ester or amide. Wait, but if there's a peak at both 1700 and 1650, that's interesting. Maybe one is a carbonyl and another is something else? Or perhaps it's a conjugated system. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch, but I'm not sure. Wait, wait, in some cases, the 1650 cm^-1 peak could be due to an ester's carbonyl or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a ketone with adjacent double bonds. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has several peaks, including some vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond somewhere. The presence of vinyl protons would typically show up as doublets or other splitting patterns around 4.5-6.5
