Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since I don't see any NMR signals that would suggest amines or amides, maybe it's an O-H group. Then, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring with some substituents.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let me note down the signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is probably an O-H proton. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, and they're usually broad because they can exchange protons. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but wait. The 1720 cm-1 in IR could be a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, but 1720 is a bit higher. Esters or ketones might have higher wavenumbers. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but then the NMR would show a different proton.

But the NMR at 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which is a good fit for a carboxylic acid. So, maybe the carbonyl is a carboxylic acid (about 1700 cm-1). Hmm, but the IR given is 1720. That might be an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me recall: Carboxylic acids are usually around 1700 cm-1, maybe a bit lower. Esters are higher, like 1730-1750. So
