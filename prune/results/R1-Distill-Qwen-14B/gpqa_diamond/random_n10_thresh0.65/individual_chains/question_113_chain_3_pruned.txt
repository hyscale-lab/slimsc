Okay, I have this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Let me try to break this down step by step. So, the question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry, and I need to figure out the chemical formula from the options provided.

First, the FTIR part. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the problem says 'very broad'... Carboxylic acids tend to have very broad O-H stretches because of hydrogen bonding. Also, alcohols have broad peaks, but maybe less so? Or maybe it's a hydroxyl group, but I'm not sure yet.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or something like that. The peak at 1650 could be due to conjugated carbonyl groups or possibly an aromatic ring (like C=O in an aromatic compound or maybe a C=C). Wait, another possibility: maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or a ketone with some conjugation. Alternatively, the 1700 might be a carbonyl and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring with C=C or maybe an amide? Hmm, but amides have N-H stretches which I might have seen in the IR as well. Since the question doesn't mention that, maybe it's not an amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: it says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere. So maybe an alkene is present.

Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. What fragments give m/z 45? Let me think. 45 is a common fragment, like the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but wait, that's usually around 91 for benzene. Hmm, 45 is a smaller fragment. Maybe it's a CH3CO+ (acetyl group) which is 43? Or another possibility: maybe it's a CH2O group? Let me calculate. CH3OH would be 32, but 45 is higher. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45? No, (CH3)2O is 45? Let's see: C=12, H=1, O=16. (CH3)2O has 2*3 H's from CH3 and O. So 2*(12+3) + 16 = 2*15=30 +16=46? Oh wait, 46. Hmm, so maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, another possibility: CH2=CH-O- something? Or perhaps the fragment is CH3COOH (no, that's 60). Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene, like O=C=O but that's more like 44. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps a (CH3)2CO+ which would be (acetone ion). Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO, so the molecular ion would be (CH3)2CO (which would be 58 g/mol). But the fragment is 45. Hmm.

Wait, 45. Hmm. Let me think of possible structures. Another approach: maybe the molecule has a ketone group. So, the IR at 1700 cm⁻¹ would be the C=O stretch. The 1650 could be a conjugated C=O or maybe a C=C from an alkene. And the broad peak at 3000 is from an O-H, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl protons. So maybe there's an alkene (double bond) present. So perhaps the compound is a dienophile or something with both an alkene and a carbonyl group.

Let me look at the options given. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2.

So, each of these is a possible formula. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each.

Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For C6H12O:
C=6, H=12, O=1.
(2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, if the compound has an O-H (like an alcohol), that doesn't add to the degree of unsaturation. So one double bond or a ring.

C6H10O: 
(12+2-10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. Two degrees of unsaturation. Could be two double bonds, or one double bond and one ring, or two rings.

C6H10O2:
(12+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. Same as above.

C6H12O2:
(12*2 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7? Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, formula is C6H12O2.

So 2C +2 - H:
C=6, so 2*6=12 + 2=
