Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction. Newtonian mechanics would say you subtract the speeds, but at relativistic speeds, we have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Since both are moving in the same direction, that's why we subtract.

So let's plug in the numbers. The first astronaut's speed is 0.6c, and the second is 0.5c. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that. (0.6*0.5)c²/c² = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative speed v_rel is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.14286c, which is approximately 0.14c. That's one part done.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so I need to calculate their energies and sum them.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but each astronaut's rest mass is different. First astronaut has mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Second is 3m moving at 0.5c.

So for the first astronaut, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut, gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 = 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is relative speed 0.14c and energy 5.96 mc². Option D has the same relative speed but energy 5 mc², which is lower. So the correct energy is around 5.96, so option C or B?

Wait, let me see the options again.

Option B: v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96 mc². No, that's not matching. Option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96. That's what I calculated.

Wait, but what about the way energy is being considered? Do I need to consider the rest mass plus kinetic energy or just the total relativistic energy?

The question says "total energy of the system". So each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, so sum them.

So yes, 5.96 mc² is option C.

Wait, but what about the units? Let me double-check the calculations.

Gamma1: 0.6c → (0.6)^2=0.36, 1-0.36=0.64 → sqrt(0.64)=0.8 → gamma1=1.25.

E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Gamma2: 0.5c → 0.25, 1-0.25=0.75 → sqrt(0.75)≈0.8660, so gamma2≈1.1547.

E2=1.1547 *3m c²≈3.464 m c².

Total E: 2.5
