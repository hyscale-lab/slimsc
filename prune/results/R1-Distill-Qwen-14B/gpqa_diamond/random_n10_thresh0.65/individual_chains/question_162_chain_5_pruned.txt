Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So the space described by this metric is 2D.

I remember that in general relativity, the area element in a 2D metric is calculated using the determinant of the metric tensor. The area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, right? So first I need to find the metric tensor components.

Looking at the metric, it's written in the form ds² = g_xx dx² + 2 g_xy dx dy + g_yy dy². But in this case, the cross term (the g_xy term) is zero because there's no cross term. So, g_xy = 0. The other components are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and g_yy is the same.

So the metric tensor g is diagonal with these terms. The determinant of a 2x2 diagonal matrix is just the product of the diagonal elements. So det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate that. det(g) = (32/(4 - r²))², where r² = x² + y². Because 4 - x² - y² is the same as 4 - r².

So the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Which is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))² ) dx dy. The square root of a square is the absolute value, so sqrt gives 32/(4 - r²). Because 4 - r² could be positive or negative, but I think the denominator comes into play depending on the region we're looking at.

Wait, but the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So when 4 - r² is positive, that's when r² < 4, so r < 2. So the region where this makes sense is inside the circle of radius 2. Because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric blows up. So the space is probably the interior of a circle with radius 2.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, I'm not too sure about pseudospheres in this context. Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, like the tractricoid. But in 2D, the metric given here might represent a space with negative curvature.

Wait, let me think about the metric. The standard metric for a pseudosphere (which is a surface embedded in 3D space) has a specific form. But here, the metric is in 2D. Alternatively, the metric could represent hyperbolic space in 2D. Let me check.

Wait, the standard metric for the hyperbolic plane in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y² +1)^2, but that's not the same as what we have here. Alternatively, if it's written as ds² =
