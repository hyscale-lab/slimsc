Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states and whether they can be clearly distinguished based on their lifetimes.

Hmm, the question says we have two energy levels, E1 and E2, with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly resolve them. The options are A to D, each with different eV values.

Wait, I remember something about lifetimes and energy resolution in quantum mechanics. Oh right! The uncertainty principle comes into play here. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there's a relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt). The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. 

So, the energy resolution depends on the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime (the more precisely the time is known), the smaller the uncertainty in energy, which means a higher resolution is possible. But wait, in this case, the lifetimes are different. Which one has a longer lifetime?

Looking at the numbers: 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. E2 has a longer lifetime. So the uncertainty for E2 would be lower because Δt is larger. 

Wait, but when we're talking about distinguishing two energy levels, the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Or wait, perhaps we're dealing with the inverse. Because if the energy difference is too small, the two states might not be resolvable.

Wait, let me think again. The lifetime of a state is related to its uncertainty in
