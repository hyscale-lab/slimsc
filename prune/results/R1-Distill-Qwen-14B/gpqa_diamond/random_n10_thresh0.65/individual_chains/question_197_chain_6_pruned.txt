Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through it.

The question is about identifying a product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options given are four different compounds, so I need to figure out what Compound X is first based on the spectral data, then determine the reaction outcome.

Let me look at the data provided. The IR and NMR spectra are given for Compound X.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad range, likely indicating an -OH group or maybe an amine. Wait, but if there's a strong peak around 2500, that could be an alkyne or an amine. Hmm, but 3400 is probably an OH stretch. Another peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. Then 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹—those might be aromatic C=C stretching. So, likely a benzene ring with substituents.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which could be an -OH proton, like in a phenol or carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a broad singlet and only one proton, maybe it's a phenol OH. Alternatively, in a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually broader, but integration as 1H. Hmm, but phenol OH is also a singlet and broad. So maybe we have either a phenol or a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets each integrating to 2H suggest two substituents opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, maybe para-substituted with something else.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, possibly a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl group, like a ketone. Or maybe part of a larger structure, like a CH in a branch.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps -CH₂-CH₂- groups, maybe adjacent to something else. Or maybe a propyl chain.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet as a doublet? Wait, it's a doublet, but integration of 3H. That sounds like a CH₃ group attached to a CH, maybe in a branching. Like an isobutyl group. For example, (CH₂CH(CH3)2) or something similar. The doublet could be from coupling with the adjacent CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H, which is typically a terminal methyl group, like CH2CH2CH3. So maybe a propyl chain or a butyl chain.

Putting this together, the aromatic part is para-substituted. The substituents on the benzene are perhaps a
