Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything about electric potential energy. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right, about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each has 2e, so 3.2e-19 C each.

12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So I'm thinking point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from there. But wait, how are they arranged? Are the 12 charges all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters? I think that's the assumption here because if they're constrained at 2m from P, they form a spherical shell, maybe.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since the system is isolated, I don't have to worry about external fields, I think.

But wait, the problem says the 12 charges are at 2m from P. So the 13th is at P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th. And how about between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same distance from each other?

Hmm, if all 12 are on a sphere of radius 2m, each charge would be a distance of 2m from P, but the distance between any two charges on the sphere would depend on their positions. But wait, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement beyond being 2m from P. So maybe I should assume that the charges are equally spaced on the sphere, but I'm not sure if that affects the potential energy calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, ignoring the interactions among the 12 themselves. That would definitely simplify the calculation.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, maybe their mutual interactions are considered. Hmm, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy, which probably implies that it's the potential energy of the system
