Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll think it through step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So, that's acetone. When ketones react with cyanide ions, I think it's a nucleophilic addition reaction. Acetone has a carbonyl group, so NaCN would provide the CN- ion, which is a nucleophile. 

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. So, the molecule has a nitrile group (CN), a hydroxyl group (OH), and two methyl groups attached to the same carbon. That means the addition of CN- to the carbonyl carbon, and then possibly a protonation step. Oh wait, but in the product, the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an -OH and a CN group?

Wait, perhaps it's a hydroxy group and a nitrile substituting for the carbonyl. Let me think about the mechanism. In ketone addition reactions, when a nucleophile like CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, it forms a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, the leaving group (which is O-) would need to leave, but in this case, maybe it's protonated. 

Wait, acetone reacting with sodium cyanide in acidic conditions. Oh, because sometimes such additions require an acid catalyst. So, for the first step, when NaCN is present with a strong acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B), the CN- would attack the carbonyl, and then the protonation would happen. So the product would have a cyanohydrin structure. 

So, the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is a ketone reacting with CN- under acidic conditions to form a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. So the reagent A must be an acid, like H3O+ or another source of H+.

Now, looking at the options, A and B are H3O+, while C and D are NaHSO3. Hmm, I think that H3O+ is the right choice for reagent A because the reaction needs acid catalysis.
