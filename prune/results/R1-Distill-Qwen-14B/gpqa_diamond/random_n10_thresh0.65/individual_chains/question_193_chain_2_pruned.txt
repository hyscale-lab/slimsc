Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right! Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

Wait, but I should probably get the exact relation. Oh, right, the formula is plx (in parsecs) equals 1 over the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, meaning d = 1/plx.

So if I substitute d into the equation for number of stars, N. Because N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, substituting gives N proportional to (d)^5.

Wait, let me think again. Because plx = 1/d, so 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then for a small change in distance dr, the change in N would relate to the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differentials. Let me think: N = k * (d)^5, where k is a constant. So dN/dd = 5k d^4. So dN is 5k d^4 dr. So dN is proportional to d^4 dr.

But the question says, "per unit range of distance, r." Hmm, so for a given dr (like, a unit change in r?), the change in N would be proportional to d^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of distance per unit distance?

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check. The initial condition is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ (1/(1/d))^5 = (d)^5. So N = C * d^5, where C is a constant.

So the number of stars increases as d^5. But the question is about how N changes with distance over a unit range. So for a small change dr, the change in N would be the derivative of N with respect to d times dr.

dN = (dN/dd) * dr. dN/dd is 5 C d^4. So dN = 5 C d^4 dr. So the change in N per unit change in r (dr=1) is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4.

Wait, but the options given are about how the number changes with distance. So the number N itself is proportional to d^5. But the question says, per unit range of distance. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the wording.

Wait, the question says, "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So are we being asked about the change in N per unit distance, i.e., dN/dr? Or are we being
