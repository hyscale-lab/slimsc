Okay, so I'm trying to answer this quantum mechanics question here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find out which energy difference allows them to be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, with various eV values.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with energy and lifetime. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π, which is ħ. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2π, or sometimes just approximated as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ.

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes might be the time uncertainties. So, the lifetimes are given as 10^-9 and 10^-8 seconds. Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. How does that relate?

Oh, wait, maybe each energy level has its own lifetime. So each state has a lifetime, and the uncertainty in energy for each state would be approximately ħ divided by the lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime.

So, to clearly distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them should be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties. That makes sense because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainties might overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

So, let me think about calculating the uncertainty for each state. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But since we're dealing with electrons, maybe we should use eV·s. Oh wait, ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But when we convert to electron volts, 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So, let's compute ħ in eV·s.

Calculating that: ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To convert to eV·s, divide by 1.60218e-19 J/eV. So, 1.0545718e-34 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, for each state, the uncertainty ΔE is ħ divided by the lifetime τ.

First state: τ1 =1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Second state: τ2 =1e-8 seconds. So ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because if the difference is smaller than that sum, the two energies might not be resolvable.

So the minimum ΔE needed is
