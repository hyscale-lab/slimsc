Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the problem says that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And S is a given 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I should probably write down what S looks like.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Hmm. Wait a second, this looks familiar. Oh right, this is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something, but let me not get confused. Alternatively, I remember that the Pauli matrices (like X, Y, Z) are 2x2 matrices used in quantum mechanics, and they have specific properties, like their eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

But let's proceed methodically. The operator Ay is c times S. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So to find eigenvalues, I have to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix.

Alternatively, since S is a 2x2 matrix, maybe it's easier to compute the eigenvalues of S first, then multiply by c to get the eigenvalues of Ay.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvalues of S.

The matrix S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i
