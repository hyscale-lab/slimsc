Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again. 

The question is about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving different relative speeds and energies.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just add them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the relativistic velocity addition formula comes into play. But wait, what's that formula again? I think it's (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1*v2)/(c²)), something like that. Let me get that right. So for two velocities v1 and v2, the relative speed u is (v1 + v2)/(1 + v1v2/c²). 

Wait, but in this case, are we looking for the relative speed of one astronaut from the other's frame or from the rest frame? Hmm, the problem says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." Oh, I think the relative speed is the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So for example, astronaut A (2m at 0.6c) would see astronaut B (3m at 0.5c) moving at what speed?

Wait, no, wait. Both are moving in the positive x-direction. So astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, and astronaut A is faster at 0.6c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: If both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the relative speed using the proper formula. Let's say astronaut B is moving at u = v2 (0.5c) in the same direction as astronaut A, whose speed is v1 = 0.6c. So from A's frame, B's speed would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait no, wait. Let me be careful. The formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction. So if frame S' is moving at speed v relative to S, then in S, an object moving at u' in S' has speed u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). But
