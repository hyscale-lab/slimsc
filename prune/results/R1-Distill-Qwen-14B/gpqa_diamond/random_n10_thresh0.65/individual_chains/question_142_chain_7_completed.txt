Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum info, but let me think through this.

The question gives the density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So first, I should probably write down what this rho looks like in matrix form.

The |0> and |1> states are the basis states. The outer products |0><0| and |1><1| are the projectors onto these states. So the matrix for |0><0| is:

[1 0
0 0]

And |1><1| is:

[0 0
0 1]

Adding them together gives [1 0; 0 1], which is the identity matrix I. Then, multiplying by 1/2, rho becomes (1/2) * I, which is:

[1/2 0
0 1/2]

Wait, so rho is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. I think this represents a completely mixed state. Because when both diagonal elements are the same, it's a maximally mixed state. Oh right, that's the case for a classical mixture of the two basis states. So the system is in a completely mixed state, meaning it's in equal probability of being in state |0> or |1>.

Now the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that qubit states can be visualized on the Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices have a representation too. Oh right, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere as well, but for mixed states, it's inside the sphere.

Wait, the Bloch vector representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector with components (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's compare. Our rho is (1/2)(I), because |0><0| + |1><1| is I. So substituting, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

What's r·σ? It's σ_x x + σ_y y + σ_z z. So for that to be zero, all the coefficients x, y, z must be zero. Because each Pauli matrix is non-zero, so their linear combination can only be zero if each component is zero. So r = (0, 0, 0).

Hmm, so the geometrical position is at the origin. Let me look at the options. Option C is (0,0,0). So that's the right answer.

Wait, but what about the Bloch sphere representation? For a pure state |psi>, the density matrix is |psi><psi|, which corresponds to a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But here, rho is a mixed state, so it's inside. But in this case, since it's (I/2), it's the completely mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere. So that makes sense, the center is the origin (0,0,0) in the Bloch sphere coordinates.

So yeah, the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a completely mixed state, where the qubit has an equal probability of being in either the \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) state. For single-qubit density matrices, the state can be represented in terms of the Bloch sphere using the general form:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is a vector in three-dimensional space, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2}I\), it becomes clear that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) are zero, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere. Among the provided options, the correct answer is:

**A) r = (1,1,0)**  
**B) r = (0,0,1)**  
**C) r = (0,0,0)**  
**D) r = (1,1,1)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the density matrix represents the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
