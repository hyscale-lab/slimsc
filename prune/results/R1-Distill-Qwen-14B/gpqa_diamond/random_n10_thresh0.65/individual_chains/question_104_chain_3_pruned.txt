Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. The planets are detected using the RV method, which I remember measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. 

So, the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. And we're supposed to find how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, wait. I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star as it moves due to the planet's orbit. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum velocity of the star. That velocity depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period, among other factors.

I remember the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/2) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ) ) ... Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Or wait, perhaps it's more accurately represented by Kepler's third law here.

Wait, wait. Kepler's third law in the context of radial velocity. The formula for the period of the planet's orbit is P² = (4π²/G
