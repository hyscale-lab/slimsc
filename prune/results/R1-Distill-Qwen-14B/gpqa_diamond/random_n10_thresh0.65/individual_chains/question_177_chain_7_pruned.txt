Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger. Oh wait, but the question is about luminosities. Hmm, okay.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength for a black body is determined by Wien's Law, which says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda is inversely proportional to T. So same lambda_max implies same temperature. Got it.

Then, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But does that affect the star's intrinsic temperature? Hmm, because the temperature is an intrinsic property, so maybe the Doppler shift doesn't change the star's actual temperature, just the observed wavelength. So when we calculate the luminosity, we should probably use the actual temperature, not the observed wavelength. Or wait, maybe the observed brightness maximum's wavelength is considered, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their observed peak wavelengths are the same. But due to their motion (radial velocity), this observed wavelength might not be the same as their actual emitted wavelength. So maybe we need to correct for the Doppler shift to find their actual temperatures?

Wait, but I'm not sure if the Doppler effect affects the calculation of luminosity. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, depending on the star's actual temperature, radius, and maybe other factors. The observed flux would be affected by distance and Doppler shift, but the question says to compute luminosity assuming black bodies. So perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation of luminosity because luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, not the observed flux. Hmm, but wait, the observed wavelength's peak could affect the calculation if it's used to find temperature.

Wait, the question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they're the same. So the observed lambda_max is same for both. But the actual lambda_max (emitted) would be different because of the Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, so the observed lambda is shorter. Conversely, if it's moving away, it's redshifted.

Wait, if Star_1 has radial velocity 0, then its observed lambda_max is the same as the emitted. Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s. Wait, but which direction? The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_1 isn't moving, Star_2 is moving away (assuming positive velocity is away). So the observed wavelength of Star_2 would be longer than its emitted wavelength. Because if Star_2 is moving away, the light is redshifted. So when the question says that the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars, that means that the actual (emitted) lambda_max of Star_2 must be shorter than Star_1's
