Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite results that don't make physical sense. It's a way to make the calculations finite by introducing a cutoff or some other method. So regularization is needed when a theory has these infinities that can't be handled otherwise.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, isn't that a classical theory, not a quantum one? Classical theories don't deal with the same kinds of infinities as quantum field theories. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't have renormalization because there's no concept of virtual particles or loop corrections. So maybe classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the divergences that quantum theories do.

So the other options are quantum theories. Let me think about each:

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory and it does require renormalization. I remember that the electron has a self-energy which leads to divergences, so you need to renormalize charges and masses. So QED does require regularization (and then renormalization after that).

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction.
