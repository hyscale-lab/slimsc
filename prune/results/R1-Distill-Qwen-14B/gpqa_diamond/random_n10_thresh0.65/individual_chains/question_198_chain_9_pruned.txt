Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about stability constants and figuring out the percentage of a particular cobalt complex in solution. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the different complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait, stability constants usually increase with the stability of the complex, right? So higher beta means more stable.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think the blue one is the one with two SCN- ligands, like [Co(SCN)₂]^n+. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the complexes. Cobalt can form various complexes with thiocyanate. The possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, Co(SCN)3^- something, and maybe more. Oh wait, the stability constants are given for β1 to β4, so four complexes.

Wait, stability constants. I remember that the stability constant, β, is for the formation of a complex. For each step, the beta represents the formation of the next complex. So for a complex like Co(SCN)_n, the beta would be the cumulative product up to that nth step. Or is each β for a specific
