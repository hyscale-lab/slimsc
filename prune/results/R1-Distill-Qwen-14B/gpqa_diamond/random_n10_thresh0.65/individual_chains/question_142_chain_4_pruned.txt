Okay, so I’ve got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this must be a mixed state because it's an ensemble of states.

Wait, let me think about what each term represents. The states |0> and |1> are the standard basis states for a qubit, right? So |0><0| is a projector onto the state |0>, and similarly for |1><1|. Adding them together and dividing by 2 would average the two states.

I recall that for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point in a 2D space (the Bloch sphere), but in terms of vectors, it's usually a 3D vector because the state is represented as (θ, φ) on the unit sphere. But wait, density matrices for a single qubit can also be represented using the Bloch vector in three dimensions. So maybe the density matrix ρ is being represented as a vector in that space.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh right, because when you expand that, you get components along the Pauli X, Y, Z axes.

So if I can write the given ρ in that form, I can find r. Let me try expanding the given ρ.

Given ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2.

But wait, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set (I + r·σ)/2 equal to I/2, that would mean r·σ must be zero. Because I/2 = (I + 0)/2. So r must be zero.

Hmm, that makes sense. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). So where is that on the Bloch
