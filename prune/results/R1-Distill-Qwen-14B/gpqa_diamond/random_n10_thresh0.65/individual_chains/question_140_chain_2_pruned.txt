Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, I'll try to identify what each substance could be. Let's start with the gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the total number of neutrons plus protons (which is the mass number) should be twice the number of protons. For example, if a molecule is H2O, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. But wait, the molecule's protons would be 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 10. Neutrons would be 0 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 8. So that's not equal. So H2O doesn't work.

Wait, another thought: what about CO2? Each CO2 molecule has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons in the most common isotope) and two O atoms (each with 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So for CO2: protons = 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons = 6 + 2*8=22. Oh wait, that would make the molecule have same number of protons and neutrons. So each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits. So W could be CO2. But wait, what about if the molecule is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's CH4? Let's see: C has 6 p, 6 n; H has 1 p, 0 n. So CH4: p =6+4=10, n=
