Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain branch of the proton-proton chain stops. Hmm, let me think. I remember the Sun's core is fusion through the pp chain, right? And there are different branches in that chain.

The pp-I branch is the main one, I think, and then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches. Oh wait, pp-III is the highest branch, involving higher temperatures maybe. So if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for the neutrinos produced?

Neutrinos come from the decay steps in the fusion processes. The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, like in the 700-800 keV range. Or wait, maybe I have that mixed up. Let me recall: the highest energy neutrinos come from the highest energy reactions. The pp-III branch is at higher temperatures, so the neutrinos from that would have higher energies.

So if pp-III stops, those high-energy neutrinos would stop being produced. But when does that affect the flux on Earth? Oh, the question says it stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The Sun's light travel time is about 8 minutes, so in 8.5 minutes, the neutrinos from the core would have already reached us. Wait, but neutrinos are produced in the core and take about the same time to escape. So if the pp-III stops, we would only notice the change in our detected neutrinos from now on, right? Or wait, because the Sun's core is where the fusion happens, and neutrinos are created and escape quickly.

Wait, neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so the time it takes for them to
