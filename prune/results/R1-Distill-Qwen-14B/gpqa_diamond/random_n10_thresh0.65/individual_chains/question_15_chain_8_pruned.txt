Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But how do I calculate the probability of that happening?

The question says both planets have the same mass and have been detected via the RV method. So, they have known minimum masses and orbital periods. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Wait, no, the question says Planet_1's period is shorter—so if Planet_2 is 3 days, Planet_1 is 1 day. Wait, no, the exact numbers aren't given, but the ratio is important.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But the stars have the same radius. So, Star_1 (Planet_1's host) is more massive but same size as Star_2. Interesting, so Star_1 is probably younger? Or maybe more evolved? Wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, but both stars have same radii. So Star_2 is a bit older, but same size as Star_1 which is less evolved? Hmm, but not sure how that's relevant.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula I think is P = (R_planet / R_star)² * (a / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5 )) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it simplifies. Wait, no, the transit probability is actually more about the alignment. The planets need to be edge-on for the transit to happen. The probability is (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some geometric factor that accounts for the orbital distance.

Wait, more accurately, the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula: P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy. Oh wait, no, another approach: the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital plane area where the transit occurs to the total possible area. It's a function of the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

The transit probability (P) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a ) ), where a is the semi-major axis of the
