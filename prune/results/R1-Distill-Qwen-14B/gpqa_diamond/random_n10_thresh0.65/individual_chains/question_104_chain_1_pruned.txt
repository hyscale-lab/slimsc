Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are roughly the same size. 

The key data given are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period? 

I think the RV method depends on the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I recall is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) / (M_star))^(1/3) * (1/(1+M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ) * (sin i) / ( (1 AU) * (1 year) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe a better approach. I remember that the semi-amplitude K is given by a formula that includes the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 AU)^(1/3) * (1 year)^(1/3) ) )) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) 

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between the semi-amplitude and the orbital period. The semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Or wait, maybe K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Wait, let's think about the formula again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (2πG) / (c) ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than the Sun's mass), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So we can approximate this as:

K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( c^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have the same mass as Neptune, M_p and M_star are the same for both. Assuming the inclination angle i is the same (like sin i is the same, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe we can assume it's the same for both, or perhaps the shifts are observed so i is 90 degrees, but it's not stated either way. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio would eliminate those terms.)

Wait, the problem says that both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. The stars have the same mass too. So when we take the ratio of K1 and K2, the M_p and M_star terms will cancel out.

So let's write the ratio K1/K2 = ( (P2/P1) )^(1/3) )

Wait, wait, no. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3), K2 = (same constant) / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, no. Because K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3), K2 = (constant) / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But the problem gives K1 and K2: K1 is 5 mA, K2 is7 mA. So since K1 < K2, that would imply that (P2/P1)^(1/3
