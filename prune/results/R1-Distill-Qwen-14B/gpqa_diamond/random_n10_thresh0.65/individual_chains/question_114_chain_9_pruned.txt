Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents from the options given. Let me write down what's happening in each reaction.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's acetone. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. So acetone plus NaCN would typically give an addition product. Wait, but in this case, it's giving 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me visualize the structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO: so the carbonyl is at position 2. Adding cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the product is a nitrile. Oh wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Adding HCN to a ketone gives a cyanohydrin. But here, the reagent is NaCN. Wait, maybe the reaction is under acidic conditions? Because for the formation of a cyanohydrin, you usually add HCN in the presence of acid.

Wait, but the product is a nitrile. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe this is a condensation reaction. No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's an addition followed by something else. Wait, the
