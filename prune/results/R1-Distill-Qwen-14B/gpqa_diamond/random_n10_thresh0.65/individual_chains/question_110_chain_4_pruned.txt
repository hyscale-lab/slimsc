Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. It's about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, like measuring the Doppler shift in stars to detect exoplanets or studying stellar populations.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with different parameters. I need to determine which two can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The key here is to figure out the apparent V magnitude each star would have because both instruments have different brightness limits for observations.

Let me start by recalling the information provided. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait—brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter (i.e., less than 17 mag), ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 mag because HIRES requires brighter (smaller mag) stars than ESPRESSO.

Wait no, wait a second. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, the maximum magnitude ESPRESSO can handle is 17. For HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so up to 16 mag. So a star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. If a star is fainter than 16 mag, HIRES can't see it, even if ESPRESSO can. So the stars must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be visible by both.

But wait, Star3 and Star4 have E(B-V) given. Oh right, extinction affects apparent magnitude. So I need to calculate the extinction-corrected apparent V magnitude for those stars.

Each star's data is as follows:

Star1:
- RA 15 deg, DEC -75
- Absolute V mag 15.5
- Distance 10 pc
So apparent V mag is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Here, d is 10 pc, so log10(10)=1.
