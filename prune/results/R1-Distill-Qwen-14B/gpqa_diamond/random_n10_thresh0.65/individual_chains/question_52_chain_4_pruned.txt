Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Okay, the question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. Let me read through the problem again.

The star normally has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the effective temperature decrease? Oh, right, because the spots are cooler, so they emit less radiation. So the star's overall luminosity is lower, and the effective temperature is calculated based on the total emission.

Now, the main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When there are spots, this ratio decreases. The ratio is N1/N2, where 1 and 2 are the two energy levels. And they're asking by what factor this ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Wait, when spots are present, Teff is lower. So the temperature of the photosphere is lower in the spotted regions. Oh, but wait, the star's overall photosphere is considered. Oh, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So I think the entire photosphere's temperature is now 5500 K when spots are present. Or wait, noâ€”maybe the spots are cooler, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. Hmm, that's a different scenario. Wait, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So I think the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K, which would be the effective temperature. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, and the rest is at 6000 K. But the problem says that the effective temperature overall decreases, so perhaps the star's photosphere is now at an average of 5500 K. But wait, effective temperature is calculated based on the total emitted flux. So if 40% of the surface is spots
