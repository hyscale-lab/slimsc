Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't need to worry about that complicating things. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent and forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. So a higher K means the complex is more stable, right? So in this case, K is pretty large, which suggests that the complex doesn't dissociate much.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So I think I need to find [Ca²+], given that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me jot down the relevant equation.

The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be written as:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-
The formation constant K is given by:
K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in solution, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. Oh, right, because EDTA can exist in various protonated forms depending on the pH, but the question states that the pH is ideal, so I think we can assume that all the EDTA is in the form that can react with Ca²+. So maybe the effective concentration of
