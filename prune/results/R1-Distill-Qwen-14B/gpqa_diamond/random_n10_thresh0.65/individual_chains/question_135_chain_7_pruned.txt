Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think it through. The question is about which particles the boson X can decay into, considering the interaction given and the mass of X being 6 GeV.

First, I'll read the problem again. The Lagrangian is given as L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, not too sure about the notation, but I think this is a Yukawa-type interaction. The boson X interacts with fermions, right? The term suggests that the fermion fields ψ_f are interacting with the scalar field X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when considering decay products, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, their combined rest mass must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So, I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

The options are A to D, each listing possible decay channels. Let's list out the possible fermions and their masses.

Fermions come in different types: quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), electrons, muons, taus, and their antiparticles. But wait, I should remember that when a boson decays, it can produce any fermion-antifermion pair as long as their rest masses allow it.

So let's get the approximate masses of the fermions:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): around 1.25 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy at 173 GeV
- Electron (e): 0.000511 GeV
- Muon (μ): 0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): 1.777 GeV

Wait, but when a boson decays into fermions, it's into a pair of a particle and its antiparticle. So the total mass for each pair is twice the mass of the individual (since each has mass m, so pair has 2m). So for each fermion f, the decay X → f f̄ is allowed if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So 2m_f ≤6 → m_f ≤3 GeV.

Which fermions have mass ≤3 GeV?

Let's go through each:

u: 0.0022 GeV → 2m is 0.0044 <<6 → allowed
d: 0.0047 → 0.0094 → allowed
s: 0.095 → 0.19 → allowed
c: 1.25 → 2.5 → allowed
b: 4.7 → 9.4 → 9.4 >6 → not allowed
t: 173 >>6 → nope
e: 0.000511 → allowed
mu: 0.105 → 0.21 → allowed
tau: 1.777 → 3.554 → 3.554>6? No, wait, 3.554 is less than 6? Wait, 3.554 is less than 6. Oh, wait, 3.554 is less than 6, so allowed.

Wait, no. Wait, 2m_f must be ≤6 GeV. So m_f must be ≤3 GeV. So for tau, m_tau is about 1.777 GeV, so 2m is about 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

So which fermions are allowed? u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

But wait, what about the top quark? No, it's way too heavy. So the possible decay channels are X→ uū, dđ, sŝ, cč, ττ̄, ee, μμ̄.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+τ−, e+e−. Wait, but b is 4.7 GeV, 2m=9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b decay is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−. Does this option include all the allowed fermions except b, t? Because their masses are under 3 GeV. Wait, the given option says c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes. So B includes all except top, which is fine. But wait, let me check the options' letters.

Wait, looking back: the options are:

A) X→b b̄ etc. → no, because b is too heavy.

B) X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−. So that includes c, which is allowed because 2m_c
