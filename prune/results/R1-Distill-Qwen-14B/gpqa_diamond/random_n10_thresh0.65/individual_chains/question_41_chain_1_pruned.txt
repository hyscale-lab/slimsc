Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the vacuum speed of light. Oh wait, but in this case, the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed of the light as observed? Or is it just the speed within the medium that matters?

Wait, the speed of light in the glass is always c/n regardless of the glass's motion, right? Because the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, not its motion. But wait, that's only if the medium is at rest relative to the observer, right? Because if the medium is moving, then maybe there's a Doppler effect or something involved.

Wait, no. The speed of light within a medium is determined by the medium's refractive index. So when the medium is moving, the observer would see the light moving relative to them. But the speed of light in the medium is v = c/n. But wait, what's the direction here?

The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards them as well. How does that affect the observed speed?

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, the velocities here are probably non-relativistic, given that v is just some constant velocity, but the speed of light
