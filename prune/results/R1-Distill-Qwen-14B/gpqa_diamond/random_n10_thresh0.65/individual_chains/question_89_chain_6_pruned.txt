Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and we're supposed to determine the coupling pattern in the NMR of the final product.

First, I'll read the problem again carefully. Let me break down each step:

1. **Starting Material**: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are provided.

2. **Product 1**: The NMR has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester.

3. **Product 2**: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. I'm not exactly sure what reaction this is, but aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. Maybe it's some kind of elimination or rearrangement reaction.

4. **Product 3**: Ozonolysis is done on product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Let me start by figuring out what each product is.

**Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH (Product 1)**

1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative with bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. Heating with KOH (a strong base) likely leads to an elimination reaction, possibly forming an alkene. But wait, when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination forms a double bond.

Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane - the positions are 1 and 3 on the adamantane structure. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so positions 1 and 3 might be on adjacent positions. So, elimination would form a double bond between those positions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, losing two equivalents of HBr, forming a diene or a single double bond. Wait, but with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two Brs on non-adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. But the reaction with KOH is proceeding via an elimination mechanism.

So, KOH would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the E2 elimination of HBr, forming a double bond. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two such eliminations occur? Or maybe each Br leads to an elimination, but in this case, the structure might not allow two separate eliminations, so perhaps it's a single elimination.

Wait, but the starting molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, each Br is on a different carbon. When KOH is added, each Br could undergo elimination. But perhaps in this case, the base abstracts a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon to each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but if each Br is on a different face of the adamantane, the elimination could form a conjugated diene? Or maybe each Br leads to a double bond, but I'm not sure. But considering the IR data, which shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. So perhaps the product is a diketone.

Wait, but elimination of HBr would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the base induces a substitution reaction. Hmm, but KOH is a base, more likely to cause elimination than substitution in such cases. Or perhaps, since adamantane is a highly substituted structure, elimination forms a more substituted alkene.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests that maybe the product is an epoxide, but no, that's usually from peracid addition. Alternatively, the product could be a ketone if the elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about ring-opening? No, adamantane is a very stable structure. Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl via oxidation. But KOH is base, not oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane might undergo a double dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't show a peak for C=C (about 1650 cm⁻¹). Instead, the IR at 1720 is more likely a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, maybe each Br is removed as HBr, and the carbons that were attached to Br form a carbonyl group. But that would require each Br to be on adjacent carbons, but in this case, 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the two bromines on carbons that are each adjacent to a bridge, so the elimination could form a bridgehead double bond. Oh, wait, but bridgehead double bonds are usually not possible due to Bredt's rule. So elimination might not be feasible for a bridgehead. So perhaps the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a secondary carbon, and elimination forms a double bond elsewhere. Let me try to think about the structure of adamantane: it's a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, the 1 and 3 positions might be on adjacent bridgeheads but not directly connected. So elimination of both Brs would not form a bridgehead double bond but perhaps a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? Maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, and then perhaps they lose water to form a carbonyl. But KOH is a base, maybe it's a substitution but that would give two -OH groups, which would then lose a water each to form carbonyls.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the KOH induces the formation of an epoxide, but that would require an oxide, and considering the IR peak, maybe. But I'm not certain.
