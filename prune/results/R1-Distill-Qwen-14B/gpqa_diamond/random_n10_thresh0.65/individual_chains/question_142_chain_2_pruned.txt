Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubits space. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what a density matrix is. I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, whereas for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, so that's an equal mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. So each state has a probability of 1/2. That makes sense because when you take the trace, the probabilities add up.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. Qubit space is a 2D space, right? Because a qubit is a two-level system. But the density matrix is 2x2, so how does it map to a point in space?

Wait, I think the Bloch sphere comes into play here. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a pure state, and mixed states are points inside the sphere. But wait, the density matrix is a mixed state, so it's somewhere inside the Bloch sphere.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of Bloch vector components. The density matrix ρ can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. Let me write that down:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y
