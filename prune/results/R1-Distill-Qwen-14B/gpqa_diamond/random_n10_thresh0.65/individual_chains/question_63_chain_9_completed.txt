Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

So the question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They give me the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and I need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, wait. So I remember that when dealing with diatomic molecules, especially in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. The next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

But the question says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor is an extension of the rigid rotor model, which accounts for bond vibrations allowing the bond length to change. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the transition. Maybe it combines both rotational and vibrational aspects.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state probably refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) but also the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the molecule is in the ground state, both vibrationally and rotationally.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher state. Since the vibrational energy levels are quantized and much higher in spacing compared to rotational levels, the next state is likely a higher vibrational state. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the quantum harmonic oscillator model, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy levels for a diatomic molecule are given by E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the fundamental state would have v=0 and J=0, making E_total = (1/2)ħω + 0. The next possible state could either increase J to 1 (rotational) or v to 1 (vibrational). But which requires a lower photon energy?

Because the energy spacing between v=0 and v=1 is ħω, while the rotational spacing for J=0 to J=1 is [ (1*(1+1)) - 0 ] * (ħ²)/(2I) ) = (2 * ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). So I need to compare these two energies to see which is lower.

Wait, but the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states. So the question is, which transition has a lower energy requirement: from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1) or to (v=1, J=0)?

But the question specifies that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one that requires the least energy, so the photon with the minimum energy needed to cause a transition.

So compute the energy differences for both possible transitions.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference:

ΔE_vib = E_v=1 - E_v=0 = ( (1 + 1/2) - (0 + 1/2) ) ħω = (1) ħω = ħ ω.

Now, the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1:

ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = [ (1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)) ] * (ħ²)/(2I) ) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So I need to calculate both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot and see which is smaller. The photon's energy should match the lower one.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me compute the numerical values.

First, calculate the moment of inertia I. I is given by μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). So Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert amu into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that:

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 3.012e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.012e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute that: (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m². So 3.012e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2048e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I). Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π), where h=6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ^2 is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ approx 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

But wait, when you compute ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I), the units would be J, because (J s)^2 / (kg m²) → J. Let me compute numerically:

ΔE_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2048e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (1.2048e-46) = approx 9.23e-23 J.

Now, compute ΔE_vib = ħ ω. ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ħ ω = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

So comparing the two, ΔE_rot is about 9.23e-23 J, which is much smaller than ΔE_vib's 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the rotational energy levels have smaller spacing than vibrational, so the photon needed for a rotational transition would have much lower energy. But the given options are on the order of 1e-27 N s, which is momentum, not energy.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. So I need to find p = E/c, where E is the energy of the photon.

Wait, photons have energy E = pc, and also E = ħ ω. But for momentum, p = E/(c) = ħ ω / c.

Wait, maybe the photon's energy must match the energy difference, so the photon's momentum is E/c.

But wait, in this case, which transition is possible? If the molecule is in the fundamental state, the next state could be either a higher rotational state or a higher vibrational state. But the question asks for the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

So the next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the smallest energy difference. So between the two options (vibrational and rotational), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The ground state is v=0, J=0. The next possible states are either (v=1, J=0), (v=0, J=1), or (v=1, J=1), but the next lowest energy would be (v=0, J=1) since that requires less energy than (v=1, J=0).

So the photon's energy must be equal to the rotational transition energy ΔE_rot ≈9.23e-23 J.

Then the momentum p is E/c. Let's compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

E =9.23e-23 J.

p = E/c = 9.23e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.077e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are this small. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated I. Let me re-calculate I.

Given:

Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert 1.818 amu to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.012e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3.012e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.012e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2048e-46 kg m². That seems correct.

Now, ΔE_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) * (J=1) vs (J=0). Wait a minute, earlier calculation might have messed up.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = (J(J+1) ħ²) / (2I).

So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2048e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (1.2048e-46) → approximately 9.23e-23 J. That still seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which would have a much higher energy. So maybe in this case, the photon's energy should match the vibrational transition.

Wait, but 4.218e-20 J is about 2.64e-5 eV (since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J), which is way higher than typical infrared photons.

Wait, but the given options are about momentum, which is E/c. Let's compute the momentum for both transitions.

For rotational transition, E ≈9.23e-23 J.

p_rot = E/c = 9.23e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

For vibrational transition, E ≈4.22e-20 J.

p_vib = 4.22e-20 /3e8 ≈ 1.407e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, looking at the options provided:

Option D is 1.4e-28 Ns (which is same as kg m/s). So that's matching the vibrational transition.

But earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the photon's momentum match the vibrational?

Hmm, confusion arises. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition from v=0, J=0 to the next possible state, which is (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the smallest energy difference.

Wait, but the vibrational energy difference is much larger than the rotational. So the rotational transition requires a photon with much lower energy. Which would imply a lower momentum. But none of the options are that low.

Wait a second, I think I might have confused the energy levels. Because the next state in the rotation-vibration model might involve a combination of both. Wait, but the question says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, wait, the non-rigid rotor model includes both vibration and rotation. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both.

But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which would be the lowest energy state, both vibrationally and rotationally. So the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0.

The next state could be either v=1 (with J=0) or J=1 (with v=0). Which one has a lower energy difference?

Earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires less energy. But the photon's momentum for that transition is about 3e-31 kg m/s, which doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, the options are in the range of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns, which is 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg·m/s.

Hmm, that's three to four orders of magnitude higher than the rotational transition's p. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, let me recompute the moment of inertia.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should compute I as the sum over the two atoms, but that's not correct. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is indeed μ r². So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the reduced mass calculation. Let me recalculate μ.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, but when computing I, perhaps I used r as 2 angstroms, but perhaps the bond length is in a different unit? No, the question states R is 2 angstroms. So r is 2e-10 m.

Wait, but another thought: Maybe the problem is actually considering the rigid rotor model, and the vibrational transition is being considered as the fundamental. Or perhaps the photon's energy needs to account for both a rotational and vibrational transition.

Wait, but the question states it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, so perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational transition's photon momentum.

Earlier, the vibrational transition's p was around 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which matches option D.

So why is that the case? Because the rotational transition requires a much smaller photon momentum, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the next state is a vibrational transition, even though that requires higher energy.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, so the next state with the lowest possible energy should be the one with the least energy difference. So the rotational transition is the one with the lower energy difference.

But since none of the options match that, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the rotational energy difference.

ΔE_rot = ħ^2/(I).

I = μ r² = ( (20 * 2)/(20+2) amu ) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

Similarly, My is 2 amu = 3.32e-27 kg? Wait, wait, no: 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg. My is 2 amu: 2 *1.66e-27 = 3.32e-27 kg.

But μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (3.32e-26 kg * 3.32e-27 kg) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 kg).

Wait, wait, wait. Let's compute it correctly.

Mx =20 amu → 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My =2 amu → 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 kg).

Wait, no. Wait, Mx is 3.321e-26 kg, My is 3.321e-27 kg.

So Mx + My = 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.653e-26 kg.

Mx * My = (3.321e-26) * (3.321e-27) = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.025 *1e-53 = 1.1025e-52 (kg^2).

So μ = (1.1025e-52 kg^2) / (3.653e-26 kg) ) = approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.055e-34)^2 / 1.207e-46 ≈ (1.113e-68) / 1.207e-46 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before. So p_rot = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But that's way below the options given. So perhaps I'm considering the wrong transition.

Wait, the question says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. So perhaps the molecule can transition to a state with both increased vibration and rotation. Or maybe the next state is a combination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, which would require a photon with energy equal to the vibrational energy spacing. Let me compute that.

ΔE_vib = ħ ω = 1.0545718e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

Then p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 N s (since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s). So this matches option D.

But why would the next state be a vibrational state if the rotational transition requires less energy? Because in some cases, perhaps the molecule cannot make a rotational transition for some reason, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) but possibly in an excited rotational state. But no, the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. So the next state should be the one requiring the least energy.

But why then, in the options, the only plausible one is the vibrational transition. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model treats the vibration and rotation as coupled, and the transition requires both a vibrational and rotational change. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simplified and only considering the vibrational transition.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches the vibrational transition.

But wait, the initial problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest possible energy difference, which is the rotational transition. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is mistakenly referring to the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me compute the vibrational transition's momentum again.

E_vib = ħ ω = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / (3e8) = 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

So 1.4e-28 Ns is option D.

But earlier, the rotational transition requires a photon with p=3e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the molecule can't make a rotational transition, but I don't see why that would be the case.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is confusing the vibration-rotation coupling. In the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the energy levels are a combination, and the next state is a vibrational state with J=0. But then the energy difference would be the same as the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the fundamental vibrational state, but the molecule is allowed to rotate. In that case, the next energy state is the first vibrational state, v=1, regardless of rotation.

But that doesn't make sense because the rotational energy is lower.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches the vibrational transition's momentum. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, and the rotational transition was neglected for some reason.

But why is that? The question states that the molecule can be modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, implying that both rotation and vibration are considered. So the next state with the lowest energy is the rotational transition, but that’s not an option. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of the rotational energy difference.

Wait, I think I messed up the rotational energy formula. The rotational energy is E_J = [J (J+1) ] * (ħ^2) / (2 I).

So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E = 2 * (ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ² / I.

So ΔE_rot = ħ² / I.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, I is μ r².

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) ) =40/22 = 1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.013e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.013e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.013e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.205e-46 kg m².

So ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.205e-46 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So p_rot = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is way smaller than any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the question is actually asking about the vibrational transition, and the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule must transition to the next higher energy state, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But in that case, the energy difference would be higher than either, so that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the question is considering the first overtone in the vibration, but that's not the case. The fundamental state is v=0, and the first transition is v=1.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the rigid rotor model, which ignores vibration.

Wait, the rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, and only considers rotation. So if the model used is the rigid rotor, then the next state after (v=0, J=0) would be J=1, requiring a photon with E_rot = ΔE_rot.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the vibrational transition's photon momentum, which gives option D.

I think perhaps the problem is intended to have us compute the vibrational transition, perhaps because the rotational transition is too small to be considered, or perhaps due to a mistake in the problem setup.

So, given that, the answer would be option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both vibrational and rotational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- **Reduced mass**: \( \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} \)
- \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), so \( \mu = 3.013 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
- **Moment of inertia**: \( I = \mu R^2 = (3.013 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.205 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \)
- **Planck's constant**: \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
- **Speed of light**: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Energy Differences:
1. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_J = \frac{J(J+1)\hbar^2}{2I} \).  
   For \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \), the energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.205 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.23 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.23 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.08 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]  
   This value is much smaller than any of the provided options.

2. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega \).  
   For \( v = 0 \to v = 1 \), the energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar\omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]  
   This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires a photon with much smaller momentum than any of the provided options, suggesting the problem is likely focused on the vibrational transition. The vibrational transition provides a momentum of approximately \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

ANSWER: D
