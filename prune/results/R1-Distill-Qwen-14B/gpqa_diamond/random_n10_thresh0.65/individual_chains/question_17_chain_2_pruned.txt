Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions and EDTA complexes. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in my classes.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, wait, what does that mean? Oh right, a stoichiometric complex means that each Ca²+ ion is bound by the EDTA in a 1:1 ratio. So if the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, that implies that each mole of Ca-EDTA has one mole of Ca²+.

But wait, the problem is asking about the concentration of calcium ions in solution. So I guess not all the Ca²+ is necessarily free. No, wait, the complex is formed, so in solution, the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. But wait, is the complex completely stable? Well, the problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. That's a pretty large K, indicating a very stable complex. So I think the assumption is that the complex is completely formed, and the concentration of free Ca²+ is minimal.

Wait, no. Wait, the formation constant K is given. Let me remember the formula for the formation constant. The formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The Kf would be [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So if the concentration of CaEDTA^2− is 0.02 M, and assuming that the EDTA is in stoichiometric amounts, but wait, wait a second. Wait, the problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, right? Because they are in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but I think that's not the case. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but in this case, the complex is Ca-EDTA, so each EDTA molecule binds one Ca²+.

Wait, no, the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, so each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA molecule. So, the total concentration of Ca²+
