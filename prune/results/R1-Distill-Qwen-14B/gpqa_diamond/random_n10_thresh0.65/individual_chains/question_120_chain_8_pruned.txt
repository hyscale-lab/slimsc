Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on parallax.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Like, plx = 1/distance (in parsecs, I think). So a star at 10 parsecs has a parallax of 0.1 arcseconds.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, perhaps in space? Or on the celestial sphere? Or maybe in some other way. Hmm. Oh wait, let's assume uniform distribution in space, meaning that the number density of stars is the same in all regions. So if you look at a certain volume of space, the number of stars is proportional to that volume.

But how does that relate to parallax? Parallax relates to distance. So, to find the number of stars in a given range of parallax, I think I need to consider how the volume of space changes with distance.

Let me think about this. The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, say n. So the number of stars in a small volume dV is n * dV.

Parallax is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So as d increases, plx decreases. So for a given range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range?

Wait, plx is in arcseconds, but d is in parsecs, so plx (in arcseconds) is 1/d (in parsecs). So, if plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dd. Let's see:

If I have a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx, what is the corresponding distance range?

d = 1/plx.

So, when plx increases by dplx, the change in d is approximately - (d^2) * dplx. Wait, let me compute that. So, d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plxÂ²) * dplx.

Hmm, but for a small dplx, the distance change is negative, decreasing as plx increases. But perhaps I should think of the distance range as d to d+dd,
