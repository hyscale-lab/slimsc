Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The main point is that each spectrograph has a limit on the brightness of the stars they can observe. ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So a star has to be bright enough (apparent V mag ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES) to be detected by each instrument. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter (smaller number) than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So a star with apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16 would be visible by HIRES, and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO.

Wait, no. Oh wait, when the star is brighter than a certain magnitude, it's easier to observe. Like, lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is V ≤17, ESPRESSO can see it. For HIRES, V ≤16. Wait, but the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. So, V <17. For HIRES, V <16.

So a star must have V apparent magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO to see it, and less than 16 for HIRES.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected by both. So a star must have V <17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and V <16 (so HIRES can also see it). So the apparent V magnitude must be less than 16, because 16 is the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, then it's also brighter than 17. So only stars with V <16 mag can be detected by both.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If a star's apparent magnitude is, say, 15, both can detect it because 15 is less than 16 and 17. If the star's magnitude is 16.5, ESPRESSO can't detect it because it's brighter than 17? No, wait, the way it's phrased, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. Wait, I think I'm getting confused about the direction of the brightness.

Wait, the magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V=15 is brighter than V=16. So if a spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 17, that means it can see V < 17. Because, for example, a star that's magnitude 16 is brighter than 17, so it's observable. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V of 17 or brighter (i.e., V <17) is acceptable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <1
