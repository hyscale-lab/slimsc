Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break it down.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak might suggest a strong hydrogen bonding, which is more typical of something like a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is an alcohol, but the broadness can vary. Also, the other peaks: strong absorption at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is usually a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower; maybe conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with the carbonyl? Or maybe an amide? Hmm. But the options are all C6H something O or O2, so maybe ester or ketone with something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, typically as a multiplet around 4.5-7 ppm, maybe split into a doublet of doublets or something similar. So the compound has a double bond. So
