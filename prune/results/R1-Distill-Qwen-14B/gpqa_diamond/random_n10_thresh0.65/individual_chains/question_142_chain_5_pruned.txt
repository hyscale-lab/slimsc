Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where its geometrical position is in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, not just a pure state.

The given density matrix is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, each term here is a projection operator. So |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere, same for |1⟩⟨1| which has 1 in (1,1). So when I add them together, each of those positions adds up to 1. Then multiplying by 1/2, each becomes 1/2. So the diagonal elements are 1/2 and 1/2, and the off-diagonal are zero. So the matrix ρ looks like:

[ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ]

Right, that's the density matrix. Now, what's the geometrical position in the qubits space? I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. Because qubits can be represented on a Bloch sphere, and for a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But here, ρ isn't a pure state because when I check the purity, it's Tr(ρ²). Let me compute that. 

Tr(ρ²) would be Tr( (1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ))² ). Since these projectors are orthogonal, when I square ρ, each term would be (1/2)^2 times |0⟩⟨0|, |1⟩⟨1|, and cross terms. Wait, no, because when you square |0⟩⟨0|, it's just |0⟩⟨0|, same for |1⟩⟨1|. The cross terms, like |0⟩⟨0||1⟩⟨1|, would be zero because ⟨0|1⟩ is zero. So ρ squared is (1/2)^2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) = (1/4)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ). Then Tr(ρ²) is (1/4)(1 + 1 ) = 1/2. Since Tr(ρ²) is less than 1, it's a mixed state.

Now, for the Bloch sphere representation, any mixed state can be written as a statistical mixture of pure states. The density matrix of a mixed state can also be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere, where the radius corresponds to the purity. Wait, the general form of a qubit density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector with magnitude ≤1. Here, σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's write ρ in terms of that. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) / 2. But |0⟩⟨0| is equal to (I + σ_z)/2, and |1⟩⟨1| is (I - σ_z)/2. Wait, let me think again. The standard basis states can be written using the Pauli matrices. Let me recall that:

|0⟩⟨0|
