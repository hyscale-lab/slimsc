Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right. And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I should probably write that down.

Wait, matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are often involved in spin operators. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches the given S. So S must be the σy Pauli matrix.

So Ay = c * σy. Since c is h/(4π), let me compute that. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, I need to find the eigenvalues a such that Ay φ = a φ. 

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. Let's compute that.

First, construct the matrix Ay - a I. 

Ay - a I = (h/(4π)) * [[0 -a', -i], [i, 0 - a']] where a' is a scaled by (4π/h) maybe? Wait, no. Let me think. Ay is (h/(4π)) * S, which is (h/(4π)) * σy. So the matrix elements are (h/(4π)) * 0 for (1,1), (h/(4π))*(-i) for (1,2), (h/(4π))*i for (2,1), and (h/(4π))*0 for (2,2). So the matrix is:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

So the matrix Ay is:

[[0, -i c],
 [i c, 0]]

where c = h/(4π). 

The characteristic equation is:

det(Ay - a I) = 0

Which is:

| (-a)   -i c       |
| i c     (-a)  |  = 0

The determinant is ( -a )^2 - ( (-i c)(i c) ) 

Wait, determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Which is a² - ( (-i)(i) ) c². Let me compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c². 

(-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - (1 * c²) = 0.

So equation: a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. 

What's c? c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). 

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, but wait, the eigenvalues are real or imaginary? Wait, no. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix with purely imaginary off-diagonal elements. Wait, no, the diagonal elements are zero. So Ay has the form [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. So it's an anti-Hermitian matrix? Or maybe Hermitian? Wait, no. The Hermitian adjoint of Ay would be [[0, i c], [-i c, 0]], which is -Ay. So Ay is anti-Hermitian. So its eigenvalues are purely imaginary?

Wait
