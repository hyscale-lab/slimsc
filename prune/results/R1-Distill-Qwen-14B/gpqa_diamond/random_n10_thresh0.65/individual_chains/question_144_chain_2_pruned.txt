Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each a different distance in meters.

Alright, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. But wait, wait—what's the formula again? Oh right, the mean decay distance L is given by L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity over c, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But first, I should find the lifetime τ. I recall that the width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, or is it Γ = ħ * τ? No, I think it's Γ = ħ / τ. Because Γ has units of energy, and ħ has units of energy multiplied by time (since E=ħν). So Γ (energy) = ħ (energy*time) / τ (time), so yes, Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the exact relation. Let me think. The natural linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/(Γ). That makes sense dimensionally. So for a particle with width Γ, the lifetime is ħ divided by Γ.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I also need to consider the energy and mass to find the gamma factor. Because gamma is E/(m c²), but since E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, gamma would be E/(m c²) but since both are in GeV, the c² is accounted for in the units. Wait, no, actually, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c², so gamma is E / (m c²). But since E and m are given in units where c is accounted for (like GeV and GeV/c²), perhaps it's just E/m.

Wait, let me think. The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, which is the total energy
