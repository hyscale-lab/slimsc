Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to find the correct products from the given options.

Let's start with part A. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the reagent is NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, Michael addition usually involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound by an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because its enolate is strong. The structure of dimethyl malonate is like CH2(CO2Me)2. So when the base (NaOEt) deprotonates it, it forms an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw this. The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so position 3 would be the alpha position to the carbonyl. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-position from where? Maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? No. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Oh, wait, that would make sense. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2
