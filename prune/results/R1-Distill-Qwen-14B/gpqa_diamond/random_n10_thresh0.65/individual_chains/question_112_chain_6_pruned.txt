Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, normalization. Right. The state should satisfy <alpha|alpha> = 1. So, the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. So, I'll compute the inner product of the state with itself.

The inner product is (1+i)*(1-i) for the |up> part and (2-i)*(2+i) for the |down> part, because when you take the conjugate of (1+i), you get (1-i), same for (2-i) becomes (2+i). Wait, no, wait, actually, when you compute |a + b|^2, it's a times a*, plus b times b*, plus cross terms. Hmm, maybe I should write it out.

So, the state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i), b=(2-i). The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1? No, wait, no, that's for orthogonal vectors. Oh wait, |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so their inner product is zero, and each has norm 1. So, the norm of |alpha> is sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2). So let's compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Calculating |a|^2: a is (1+i), so |a|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because |1 + i|^2 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) [Wait, wait no. Wait, |a|^2 = a * a*, where a* is the complex conjugate. So a = 1+i, so a* is 1-i. Multiplying them: (1+i)(1-i) = 1*1 + 1*(-i) + i*1 + i
