Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Let's see, I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all starting with C6, varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts. I need to figure out which one fits the spectral data.

Starting with the FTIR data: the peaks are at 3000 (broad), 1700, and 1650 cm⁻¹. The broad peak around 3000 suggests O-H stretching, probably from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Wait, but a broad peak is more characteristic of an -OH group, like in an alcohol or maybe a carbonyl with an O-H like a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. Oh, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the peak at 1700 is strong. That's a carbonyl group. But what kind? If it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broader and maybe around 2500-3300 as a very broad peak. Wait, but the 3000 peak is very broad. Hmm, but carboxylic acids usually have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300, maybe a very broad one. Alternatively, maybe an alcohol with a carbonyl. 

Wait, the 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak; that's a good indication of a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the O-H would be broad and strong. But the FTIR here shows a very broad absorption at 3000, which could be that. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, maybe. Esters have carbonyls around 1730-1750, but sometimes lower, depending on substitution. Wait, but 1700 is a bit lower, maybe suggesting something else, like a conjugated carbonyl. Or maybe a ketone. Let me think. Another peak at 1650. That's in the region of conjugated carbonyls, like a carbonyl next to a double bond
