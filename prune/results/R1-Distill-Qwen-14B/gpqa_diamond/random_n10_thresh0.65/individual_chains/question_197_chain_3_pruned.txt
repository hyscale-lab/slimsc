Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see what I can do. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data and predicting the product after a reaction. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR and NMR data given. The IR shows peaks at several regions. The big peaks are in 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid? Wait, but the peak around 1720 is more typical for a ketone or maybe an ester. If it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be broader and perhaps around 2500-3300. But wait, the 3400-2500 region is broad, which might suggest an -OH group. But wait, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3300 and a strong carbonyl around 1700. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740 maybe, but 1720 could still fit. Also, there's a peak at 1610 and 1450, which might be aromatic C=C stretches. So the compound might be an aromatic ester or something similar.

Wait, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet but broad. That's a high chemical shift, so likely an aldehyde proton, but more probably an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm but can be sharp. Wait, but in D2O, the OH might exchange, but the peak here is broad, so maybe it's an alcohol. Or wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would appear as a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, which fits here. So perhaps this is a carboxylic acid. Wait, but then the IR peak at 1720 would make sense for a
