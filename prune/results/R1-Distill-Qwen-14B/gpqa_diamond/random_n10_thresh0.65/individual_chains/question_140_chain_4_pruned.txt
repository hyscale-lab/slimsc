Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question carefully.

The question talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. 

Then, there's another part: the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down piece by piece.

First, I think we should figure out what Substance X is. It's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also a reagent. Common reagents in organic chemistry include things like NaOH, KOH, Na, K, etc. Wait, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe it's something like NaOH, which contains Na, which has isotopes. Or perhaps it's a heavier group 1 or 2 metal.

The reaction with liquid Y is violent, and produces a gas W. Let's think about reactions between metals and liquids. Common reactions could be metals reacting with acids (like HCl or H2SO4) to produce hydrogen gas. Or maybe it's a reaction with water. For example, sodium reacts violently with water to produce hydrogen gas.

Wait, but the gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Let's think about that. For a molecule, the simplest is probably H2 because each H has one proton and zero neutrons. But that doesn't fit because the number of protons and neutrons would be unequal. Alternatively, maybe it's another gas. Let's think about other gases that form from such reactions.

Wait, let's think about the possible products. If X is a metal reacting with an acid, perhaps Y is an acid. For example, sodium reacting with HCl: 2Na + 2HCl → 2NaCl + H2↑. The gas here is H2. Each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each H2 molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So the number of protons (2) is not equal to the number of neutrons (0). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, the problem says the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's calculate. Let's think of possible molecules. For example, CO2 has 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = but wait, that's the molecular weight. But in terms of protons and neutrons: Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (for C-12), each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So CO2 would have 6+8*2=22 protons, and 6+8*2=22 neutrons. So the total protons and neutrons in the molecule are equal. So CO2's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. But wait, that's the molecule. So each molecule would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons.
