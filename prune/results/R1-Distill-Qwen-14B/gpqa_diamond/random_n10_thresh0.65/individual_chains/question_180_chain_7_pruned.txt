Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it carefully.

Alright, the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. I should remember that value.

Out of these 13 particles, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I think this has to do with electric potential energy. Because the system is isolated, I guess the energy is all potential energy since there's no kinetic component mentioned.

Wait, so all the 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, where the 13th charge is fixed. So, the setup is like this: one charge is at the center, and the others are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters.

I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But since the system is isolated, maybe we don't need to consider external fields. Or wait, actually, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is (k q1 q2)/r. But for multiple charges, you have to consider all pairs.

Wait, but in this problem, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so I think the system consists of that fixed charge and the 12 others.
