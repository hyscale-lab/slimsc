Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's like a cage-shaped molecule. The dibromo part means there are two bromine atoms attached at positions 1 and 3. 

The first step is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, maybe an E2 mechanism. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a base, they usually eliminate to form alkenes. But wait, the positions here are 1 and 3 on adamantane. Are they adjacent? No, because in adamantane, the structure is tetrahedral, so 1 and 3 are across from each other. Wait, no, maybe in the structure, 1 and 3 are actually on adjacent carbons. I might need to visualize that. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that the two bromines are on adjacent positions, making it a vicinal dihalide. 

Wait, but if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the structure is such that each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. So, maybe they're not adjacent in the chain. Hmm. Oh wait, no. Wait, in the adamantane structure, each bridge connects two carbons, so 1 and 3 might be on adjacent bridgeheads. Let me imagine the structure:
