Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Photometric observations show brightness variations because the star rotates, modulating which spots we see. The problem says this can look like an exoplanet in terms of the light curve. They want to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm. So, the key is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip in brightness when the planet transits is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but wait. I think I should think about what each effect does. When a planet transits a star, it blocks a part of the star's light. The dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. For spots, when the star rotates, different spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness because spots are darker. But wait, the star's effective temperature is an average, so the spots being cooler would contribute less flux. So when the spots are on the visible side, the total flux decreases.

Alright, so the star's total brightness without spots is L = 4πR^2σT^4. But with spots, the effective brightness changes when the spots are visible.

Wait, but the star has a radius
