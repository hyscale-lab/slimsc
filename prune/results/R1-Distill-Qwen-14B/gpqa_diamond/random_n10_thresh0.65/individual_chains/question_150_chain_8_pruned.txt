Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can be tricky for me. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem states that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO reacts with a series of reagents. The reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. The NMR data is also provided, so I need to figure out the structure of the starting compound, see what happens during each reaction step, and identify the final product from the options given.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Hmm, calculating the degree of unsaturation might help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, substituting the values:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

The formula is: Degree of Unsaturation = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could mean a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees), a double bond or ring, and maybe an aldehyde group or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm. But wait, in some cases, like if the aldehyde is next to an electron-withdrawing group, it could be a bit downfield. But triplet usually implies two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and as a singlet because they have no neighboring Hs. Wait, unless it's part of a conjugated system or something else. Hmm, maybe it's a different group, but I'll think more about that later.

6.98 (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. That could be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like, two protons on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, a doublet for two protons suggests each is adjacent to one proton. Wait, maybe it's a pair of protons in a meta or para position. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a conjugated diene or something else.

6.51 (d, 2H): Another doublet, also two protons. Could be another aromatic ring, perhaps ortho to the first.

6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad could mean exchange with something, like an -OH group or maybe an amine. But the compound has an O and N. Wait, the starting formula is C8H9NO, so maybe this is an amide or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a pair of protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a phenol or an enol.

3.66 (d, 2H): A doublet for two protons. Maybe a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like oxygen. So maybe an OCH2 group. Wait, that would fit with perhaps a methylene next to an oxygen.

Putting it all together, let's try to imagine the structure. So, the aldehyde at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. Wait, but aldehydes are usually at higher ppm and as a singlet. Maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an enal, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. The triplet would then be due to coupling with two adjacent protons.

Wait, another possibility: the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, if the structure is R-CH2-CHO, the CH2 protons would be next to the aldehyde. But in that case, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet if each H on CH2 couples with it. Hmm, but that might not align with typical splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like a vinyl group next to the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and some substituents. Let's think about the substituents.
