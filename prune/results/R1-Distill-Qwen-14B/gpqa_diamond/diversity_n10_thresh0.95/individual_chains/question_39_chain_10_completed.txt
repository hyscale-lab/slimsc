Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Let me read the problem again carefully.

We've got 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, I'm not sure I get that part. Oh wait, maybe I should think about normalization. Because the total probability should integrate to 1 over all space, but here the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

So, the wave function is Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Usually, the wave function can be complex, but the modulus squared represents the probability density. Also, the imaginary part here is -0.5i. Wait, maybe I'm misreading it. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something else. Or maybe the equation is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, which is a complex number. But for the probability density, I need |Ψ|^2, which is Ψ times its complex conjugate.

But wait, I might be overcomplicating. Let me think. The wave function is given, and when measuring position, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So, that means the wave function is zero outside this region. Therefore, the wave function must be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me think about the region. The wave function could be non-zero only where the denominator doesn't cause issues. Wait, sqrt(1 + x) would have a problem when 1 + x is negative. So, 1 + x > 0 → x > -1. So the wave function is defined for x > -1, but the measurements show particles only between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, but the given expression is valid in that region.

Hmm, maybe I need to model this as a normalized wave function. The wave function Ψ(x) is non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So, the modulus squared of Ψ(x) must integrate to 1 over this interval.

Wait, but the given expression for Ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute the modulus squared. The modulus squared is |Ψ|^2 = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5)^2. Because if Ψ = A + Bi, then |Ψ|² = A² + B².

So, |Ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25. 

But wait, since the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, the integral of |Ψ|² from 1 to 3 should equal 1. Because the total probability is 1.

So, integrating (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, the real part is a / sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you square the modulus, it becomes (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 is ∫ [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

First, split the integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

So, a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Adding them together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the math.

Wait, ∫ [ a^2/(1+x) ] dx from 1 to 3 is a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), so evaluated from 1 to 3, it's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that integral is a² ln(2). 

The other integral is ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3: which is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So, a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5/( ln(2) )

Compute that. 

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So, a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, B is 0.85. That must be the answer.

Wait, but why is the wave function given with an imaginary part of -0.5i? Because in that case, the modulus squared isn't just the real part. But I accounted for both real and imaginary parts in the calculation. So, the presence of the imaginary part (a constant) affects the normalization.

So, the correct answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of "a" in the wave function Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, we use the normalization condition for wave functions. The total probability of finding the particle must integrate to 1 over the region where the wave function is non-zero, which is between x = 1 and x = 3.

The modulus squared of the wave function is given by:

\[
|\Psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\Psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\Psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. The first integral is:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. The second integral is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the numerical value of "a" is approximately **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.
