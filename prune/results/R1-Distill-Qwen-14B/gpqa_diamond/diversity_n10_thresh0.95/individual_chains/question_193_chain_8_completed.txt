Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is number of stars ~ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance, r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. Parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So if the distance is larger, the parallax is smaller. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Substituting plx with 1/d, that would make 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1/(1/d^5) equals d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think that refers to the differential change, like the number of stars per unit distance interval. So maybe I need to find dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r.

If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5r^4. But wait, let me think again. Wait, the original N is proportional to plx^(-5) = (1/(d))^(-5) = d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

So the number of stars in the region depends on distance. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range of r. So they probably want the rate of change, like the derivative.

So dN/dr would be the derivative of (k d^5) with respect to d. The derivative is 5k d^4. So dN/dr is proportional to d^4. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see an option that directly matches this. Let me check the options again.

Options are A) ~ r^3, B) ~ r^5, C) ~ r^4, D) ~ r^2.

Wait, so the question is phrased as: How does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the derivative but about the number in a range. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars between d and d + dr would be proportional to (d^5 - (d + dr)^5). But for small dr, this is approximately 5 d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance dr is 5 d^4 dr, meaning the number per unit dr is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So maybe they mean that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to r^4. So in that case, the answer would be proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about a differential but about a cumulative effect. Wait, but the original relation is N ~ 1/plx^5, which gives N ~ d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So per unit distance, the number of stars added would be the derivative, which is 5d^4. So the change in N per unit change in r is proportional to r^4. So why would that be the case?

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance r. The volume of such a shell is 4π r² dr. But in this question, it's about a specific region of the sky, not the entire universe. So maybe it's not about volume but about the density of stars in that region.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether the number of stars is being counted in a certain volume or per unit area. Because parallax relates to distance, but if we're talking about a specific region in the sky, it's probably a fixed area, like a square degree. So the number of stars depends on distance in a certain way. So if you have a fixed area, the number of stars in that area would relate to the number of stars at a certain distance.

But the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5.

So for a unit distance interval, the change in N would be the derivative dN/dd. Which is 5d^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but looking back, the options are about how the number changes with distance. So if N increases as r^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, which is the derivative. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4.

So the answer should be option C.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the given relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of \( r \) as \( r^4 \).

Among the given options:
- \( A) \sim r^3 \): Incorrect, as the change is proportional to \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- \( B) \sim r^5 \): Incorrect, as \( r^5 \) represents the total number of stars, not the rate of change.
- \( C) \sim r^4 \): Correct, as shown by the derivative.
- \( D) \sim r^2 \): Incorrect, as the change is proportional to \( r^4 \), not \( r^2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).

Answer: C
