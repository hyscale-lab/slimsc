--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They're assuming the stars radiate as black bodies and want to compute how much brighter Star_1 is than Star_2 in terms of luminosity. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I remember is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since σ is a constant, for comparing two stars, we can ignore it. So L is proportional to R² times T⁴.

Wait, but to find the ratio of their luminosities, L1/L2, it's (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since R1 is 1.5 R2, R1/R2 is 1.5, so R1²/R2² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So if the temperatures are the same, L1 would be 2.25 times L2. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So if their λ_max is the same, then T must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 equals T2? Wait, but wait a second. Oh, but wait no. Wait, wait. Because the stars are moving with radial velocities, their observed wavelengths might be different due to Doppler shift. So their actual temperatures could be different, but the observed λ_max would be shifted.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both. But their actual temperatures might differ because of their velocities.

So I need to account for the Doppler shift here. Let me think. The Doppler effect for light says that the observed wavelength λ' is related to the source wavelength λ by λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), or for non-relativistic speeds, approximately λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/c ), where v is the radial velocity (positive if moving away). Wait, I might get the formula wrong; let me recall. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ' = λ * sqrt[ (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ] where v_r is the radial velocity. Oh wait, but if the star is moving towards us, v_r is negative, I think.

So let me see. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed λ_max is the same as its actual λ_max. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's say it's moving away from us, so v is positive. So its observed λ_max' is longer than its actual λ_max because when a source moves away, the wavelength is stretched (redshifted). 

So, the observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1_obs = λ1_actual. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_actual * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), since it's moving away. But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So λ1_actual = λ2_actual * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ). 

But from Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T, so λ1_actual = 1/T1 and λ2_actual = 1/T2. Wait, but let me clarify. So the actual λ_max for Star_1 is λ1 = b / T1. For Star_2, λ2 = b / T2. 

But the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ). 

Since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, λ1 = λ2_obs. So,

λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Substituting λ1 and λ2 from Wien's law:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

The b's cancel out:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Let's solve for T1/T2. Let me rearrange:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no. Let me re-arrange the equation:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me take the reciprocal of both sides.

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which would be:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Yes, that makes sense. So T1 is T2 multiplied by sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Now, I need to compute v. The radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v/c. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So v/c ≈ 0.023333.

Now compute (1 - v/c) and (1 + v/c):

1 - v/c ≈ 0.976667

1 + v/c ≈ 1.023333

So the ratio (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) is 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 0.976667 by 1.023333:

Hmm, 0.976667 ≈ 0.976667

1.023333 ≈ 1.023333

So 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ let me compute this. Let's write it as 976667 / 1023333. Let's approximate.

Alternatively, we can compute using fractions. Let me compute 0.976667 / 1.023333.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ (approx 0.9767 / 1.0233) ≈ let's see:

Let me compute 0.9767 divided by 1.0233.

Well, 1.0233 * 0.955 = ? Let's see:

1.0233 * 0.95 = 0.972135

1.0233 * 0.005 = 0.0051165 → So 0.95 → ~0.972135, but our numerator is 0.9767.

So 0.972135 is for 0.95, 0.9767 is 0.004565 higher.

Each 0.001 increase in the multiplier adds about 1.0233 * 0.001 = 0.0010233.

So 0.004565 / 0.0010233 ≈ ~4.46 times 0.001.

So approximately 0.95 + 0.00446 ≈ 0.95446.

So the ratio is approximately 0.95446.

So sqrt(0.95446) is sqrt of approx 0.95446.

What's sqrt(0.95446)? Let's see. 0.977 squared is 0.954 (0.977^2 = (0.977)(0.977) → 0.954529). So sqrt(0.95446) is approximately 0.977.

So T1 = T2 * 0.977 → T2 = T1 / 0.977 ≈ 1.023 T1.

Wait, wait. Wait, earlier equation: T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is T1 = T2 * sqrt(0.95446) ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So T2 = T1 / 0.977 ≈ 1.023 T1.

Wait, no, because T1 = (T2) * 0.977 → rearranged, T2 = T1 / 0.977 ≈ T1 * 1.023.

Hence, the temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1 by about 2.3% (since 1.023 is 2.3% higher than 1).

Wait, but that's the temperature relation. Now, we need to find the ratio of luminosities. L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1² = (1.5)^2 R2² → (2.25 R2²).

So R1² / R2² = 2.25.

Now, T1 and T2 are related as T1 = T2 * 0.977.

So T1 = 0.977 T2 → T1^4 = (0.977)^4 T2^4.

Compute (0.977)^4.

Let me compute 0.977^2 first: 0.977 * 0.977 ≈ (0.977)^2 ≈ 0.954529.

Then square that: 0.954529^2 ≈ approx 0.9108.

So (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.9108.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = (0.977^4) = 0.9108.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9108) → 2.25 * 0.9108.

Let me compute that:

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025

2.25 * 0.0108 = 0.0243.

So total is 2.025 + 0.0243 = 2.0493.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 2.23 or higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Doppler shift calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So λ2_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

And since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, λ1_actual = λ2_actual * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me re-express that.

Wien's law: λ_max = b / T.

So λ1 = b / T1.

λ2 = b / T2.

But the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

And observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1_obs = λ1 * 1 (since v=0).

So, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ1 = b/T1, λ2 = b/T2. So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Rearranged:

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, that's different from before. So earlier, I had T1 = T2 * sqrt(...), but now this says T2 is T1 multiplied by sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), which is larger than 1, so T2 is larger than T1.

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + 0.02333)/(1 - 0.02333) )

Compute (1 + 0.02333) = 1.02333.

(1 - 0.02333) = 0.97667.

So (1.02333 / 0.97667) ≈ 1.0478.

So sqrt(1.0478) ≈ 1.0236.

So T2 = T1 * 1.0236 → T2 is about 2.36% higher than T1.

So T1 = T2 / 1.0236 → T1 ≈ 0.9766 T2.

So now, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1² = 2.25 R2².

T1 = 0.9766 T2 → T1^4 = (0.9766)^4 T2^4.

Compute (0.9766)^4.

First, 0.9766^2 = approx (0.9766 * 0.9766 ) → let me compute:

0.9766 * 0.9766:

= (1 - 0.0234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.0234) + (0.0234)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0468 + 0.000548 → ≈ 0.953748.

So (0.9766)^2 ≈ 0.9537.

Now, (0.9537)^2 → approx 0.9098.

So (0.9766)^4 ≈ 0.9098.

So T1^4 = 0.9098 T2^4.

Putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9098) → 2.25 * 0.9098 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.

2.25 * 0.0098 = approx 0.02205.

So total is 2.025 + 0.02205 ≈ 2.04705.

Wait that's about 2.047, which is around 2.05. But the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, that's not matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Doppler shift formula. Let me double-check that. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ). So that's correct. So the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the star's temperature affects the radius. Wait, but no, the radius is given as 1.5 times. Also, the mass isn't directly relevant to the luminosity calculation in this case, I think, unless we're considering it in a different way, but the problem says to assume black body radiation, so mass probably doesn't come into play here except perhaps for other factors, but in this problem, I think only radius and temperature matter for luminosity.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the velocities in a different way. Let me think, perhaps I should account for the Doppler effect correctly. Maybe I should use the approximation for v much less than c, which is λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/c) for receding sources.

Wait, so if v is 700 km/s, which is about 0.0233c, so the approximation might be better. Let me try that.

So, using λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/c), for Star_2.

So, λ1_obs = λ1_actual = b / T1.

λ2_obs ≈ λ2_actual (1 + v/c) = (b / T2) (1 + v/c).

Set λ1_obs = λ2_obs:

b/T1 = (b/T2)(1 + v/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + 0.02333 )

→ 1/T1 = (1.02333)/T2 → T2 = T1 * 1.02333.

So T2 is 2.333% higher than T1.

So T1 = T2 / 1.02333 → approximately 0.9768 T2.

So, T1^4 = (0.9768)^4 T2^4 ≈ (0.9768)^2 squared → 0.9542 then squared → 0.910.

So T1^4 ≈ 0.910 T2^4.

Now, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

R1 is 1.5 R2 → R1² = 2.25 R2².

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.910) ≈ 2.25 * 0.91 → 2.0475.

This is again about 2.05. But the options don't have anything near that. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait a minute, perhaps I have the Doppler shift in the wrong direction. What if Star_2 is moving towards us instead of away? Because if v is positive when moving away, but if it's moving towards us, v would be negative. Let's see.

Wait, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s. The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. But radial velocity could be positive (recession) or negative (approach). So perhaps I got that wrong.

Wait, in the problem statement, I think Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. But I'm not told whether it's moving away or towards. Oh wait, the problem says Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s. But it doesn't specify the direction. So perhaps I need to assume it's moving away, but perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the velocity could be towards us, but that's unclear.

Wait, but the observed λ_max being the same suggests that the Doppler shift must make the λ_max for Star_2 appear at the same wavelength as Star_1's.

Wait, perhaps I should let v be Star_2's velocity, and regardless of direction, compute the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula in terms of temperature. Because the peak emission wavelength is determined by the star's temperature, and the observed wavelength is adjusted by the Doppler shift.

Wait, another approach: the observed wavelength is the same for both stars. So their actual temperatures and velocities must adjust so that their observed emission peaks match.

But perhaps I should model it correctly.

Wait, let me re-approach this.

Let me denote for Star_1: v1 = 0, so observed λ1 = λ1_actual (since no Doppler shift).

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s.

Assuming Star_2 is moving away, so the wavelength is longer.

We have λ1_actual = λ2_observed = λ2_actual * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But from Wien's law, λ_max = b / T.

So,

λ1_actual = b / T1.

λ2_actual = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Canceling b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Rearranging,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + 0.02333) / (1 - 0.02333) )

Compute (1.02333)/(0.97667) = approx 1.0478.

So sqrt(1.0478) ≈ 1.0236.

So T2 = T1 * 1.0236 → T2 is 2.36% higher than T1.

Hmm, same as before.

So then the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1² = 2.25 R2².

T1 = T2 / 1.0236 → T1 = approx 0.9766 T2.

So T1^4 = (0.9766)^4 T2^4.

As before, (0.9766)^2 ≈ 0.9537. Squared again, 0.9537^2 ≈ 0.9098.

So T1^4 is approximately 0.9098 T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9098) → 2.25 * 0.9098 ≈ let's compute.

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.

2.25 * 0.0098 = 0.02205.

Total is 2.025 + 0.02205 = 2.04705.

Hmm, about 2.05. But the options are all around 2.23 and higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the direction of the velocity.

Wait, perhaps Star_2 is moving towards us, which would cause a blueshift, making its observed λ_max shorter. So instead of v being positive, it's negative.

Wait, let me try that. Let's assume Star_2 is moving towards us, so v2 is negative 700 km/s.

So the Doppler shift formula would be λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but v is negative.

So,

λ2_obs = λ2_actual * sqrt( (1 + (-0.02333) ) / (1 - (-0.02333) ) )

Which is sqrt( (0.97667) / (1.02333) ) ≈ sqrt(0.95446) ≈ 0.977.

So λ2_obs = λ2_actual * 0.977.

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_actual = λ2_obs = λ2_actual * 0.977.

From Wien's law:

λ1_actual = b / T1.

λ2_actual = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 0.977.

Cancel b,

1/T1 = 0.977 (1/T2 )

→ 1/T1 = (0.977)/T2 → T2 = T1 * 0.977.

So T2 is 2.3% lower than T1.

Now, compute L1/L2.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1² = 2.25 R2².

T2 = 0.977 T1 → T2^4 = (0.977)^4 T1^4 → 0.977^4 = approx 0.9108.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1^4) / ( (0.977 T1 )^4 )

= 2.25 * 1 / (0.977^4 )

= 2.25 / 0.9108 → approx 2.47.

Wait, that's about 2.47, which is higher than any of the options. Hmm, but the options are up to 2.35. So maybe I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, but let me compute 2.25 / 0.9108 accurately.

2.25 / 0.9108 → Let's compute.

0.9108 × 2.47 is approx 2.25?

Wait, 0.9108 × 2.47 → 0.9108 *2 = 1.8216, 0.9108 *0.47 ≈ 0.428. Total is about 2.25. So yes, 2.47 is the ratio.

But the options are around 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35. So 2.47 is not among them. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the velocities are in the opposite direction, so v2 is -700 km/s (moving towards us). So the calculation would be different. Let me redo the Doppler shift.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, v is -700 km/s, so v/c = -0.02333.

So,

λ2_obs = λ2_actual * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= λ2_actual * sqrt( (1 - 0.02333)/(1 + 0.02333) )

= λ2_actual * sqrt( (0.97667)/(1.02333) )

= λ2_actual * sqrt(0.95446) ≈ λ2_actual * 0.977.

So λ2_obs = 0.977 * λ2_actual.

But λ1_obs = λ1_actual = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_actual = 0.977 * λ2_actual.

From Wien's law,

λ1_actual = b / T1.

λ2_actual = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = 0.977 (b / T2 )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = 0.977 (1/T2 )

→ 1 / T1 = 0.977 / T2 → T2 = T1 * 0.977.

So T2 is lower than T1 by 2.3%.

So, T2 = 0.977 T1.

So T2^4 = (0.977)^4 T1^4 = 0.9108 T1^4.

Now,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 (0.977 T1 )^4 )

= (2.25 R2^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * 0.9108 T1^4 )

= 2.25 / 0.9108 ≈ 2.47.

So the luminosity ratio is about 2.47, which isn't an option. So I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the luminosity ratio formula can be expressed in terms of the observed λ_max.

Wait, but the observed lambda is the same for both. So maybe I can express each star's luminosity in terms of their observed parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the luminosity based on the observed wavelengths. Because the luminosity calculation as a blackbody depends on the star's actual temperature and radius, but the observed flux depends on distance as well. Hmm, but the problem says the stars are observed to have the same peak wavelength, but I don't think distance is given here, so I think the problem is assuming that the stars are at the same distance, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the distance isn't a factor here.

Wait, another thought: the Luminosity as seen by an observer is the intrinsic luminosity multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift. Because when a star is moving away (positive z), its light is redshifted, which makes it appear dimmer in the observed frame. But wait, this applies when considering flux, not luminosity. Because luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, whereas the flux (which is what we observe) depends on the luminosity and distance and redshift.

Wait, but in this problem, maybe the astronomers are calculating the luminosity as emitted by the stars, not the observed flux. So perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength but not the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, that might complicate things. Let me think again.

The problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. Since luminosity is an intrinsic property, perhaps the radial velocity and Doppler shift are used to find the actual temperatures, regardless of observed wavelengths.

Wait, but the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the actual temperatures are different, but the Doppler shift makes the observed wavelengths match.

So perhaps I should model the problem as: the observed λ_max for both is the same. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 is shifted by its velocity, while Star_1 has no shift.

So, the observed λ_max is the same for both, but their actual λ_max are different.

Then, using Wien's law, I can relate their actual temperatures via the Doppler shift.

So, for Star_1: observed λ1 = λ1_actual = b / T1.

For Star_2: observed λ2 = λ2_actual * Doppler factor.

Since observed λ1 = observed λ2, λ1_actual = λ2_actual * Doppler factor.

So, λ1_actual = λ2_actual * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

From Wien's law: λ1_actual = b / T1, λ2_actual = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

→ 1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

→ T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is the same as earlier.

So, T2 = T1 * sqrt(1.02333 / 0.97667) → sqrt(1.0478) ≈ 1.0236 → T2 = 1.0236 T1.

So, T2 is larger than T1.

Now, L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1^2 = 2.25 R2^2.

T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.0236 → T1 = T2 / 1.0236 → T1^4 = (1/1.0236)^4 T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 ) → 2.25 * (1/1.0236^4 )

Compute 1.0236^4.

1.0236 squared is approx 1.0478.

Then squared again, (1.0478)^2 ≈ 1.098.

So 1.0236^4 ≈ 1.098.

So 1/1.098 ≈ 0.9108.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9108 ≈ 2.047.

Hmm, same as before. So around 2.05. But the options are all higher.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c). Let me compute it again.

v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s → v/c = 700 / 300000 = 0.007/3 = 0.002333... No, wait, 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ) → 0.023333.

So (1 + v/c) = 1.023333, (1 - v/c) = 0.976667.

So their ratio is 1.023333 / 0.976667 ≈ 1.0478.

So sqrt(1.0478) ≈ 1.0236.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (T1 / T2) as 1/1.0236 = 0.9766.

So T1^4 is 0.9766^4 = 0.9766 * 0.9766 = 0.9537, then squared again is 0.9537 * 0.9537 ≈ 0.9098.

So, the calculation seems correct. So the luminosity ratio is 2.25 * 0.9098 = 2.047.

But again, this is not matching any of the options. So either I'm missing something, or perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for luminosity is incorrect. Maybe I should not use L = 4π R² σ T⁴, but instead L = 4π R² σ (T_obs)^4, where T_obs is the observed temperature.

Wait, no. Luminosity is an intrinsic property, based on the star's actual temperature and radius. The observed flux depends on the distance and any redshift, but the question is about the intrinsic luminosity, so it's based on actual T and R.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor, so perhaps the calculation uses the observed parameters.

Wait, but the observed parameters would be affected by the Doppler shift, affecting the temperature as observed.

Wait, perhaps the observed temperature is what's used in the luminosity calculation. No, that doesn't make sense. Luminosity is based on the star's actual T and R, not the observed T and R.

Hmm, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the correct answer is 2.25 (option A), but that seems unlikely because the Doppler shift would adjust the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift formula. Let me re-derive it.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

But when the source is moving towards the observer, v_r is negative, so the formula becomes:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 - |v_r|/c)/(1 + |v_r|/c) )

Which is shorter wavelength (blueshift).

So for Star_2, if it's moving towards us, v_r = -700 km/s.

So λ2_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 - 0.02333)/(1 + 0.02333) )

Which is sqrt( 0.97667 / 1.02333 ) = sqrt(0.95446) ≈ 0.977.

So λ2_obs = 0.977 * λ2.

But λ1_obs = λ1.

Given that λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1 = 0.977 * λ2.

From Wien's law,

λ1 = b/T1,

λ2 = b/T2.

So,

b/T1 = 0.977 * (b/T2 )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = 0.977 (1/T2 )

→ T2 = T1 * 0.977.

So T2 is lower than T1 by 2.3%.

Now, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= (2.25 R2^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But T2 = 0.977 T1 → T2^4 = (0.977)^4 T1^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ T1^4 / ( (0.977 T1 )^4 ) ]

= 2.25 / (0.977^4 )

Compute 0.977^4:

0.977^2 = approx 0.9545.

0.9545^2 = approx 0.9108.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 0.9108 ≈ 2.469.

So approximately 2.47, which is higher than any option given. So this is still a problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the Doppler effect on the luminosity, in terms of how much brighter or dimmer a star appears due to the redshift or blueshift. Because when a star is moving away, its light is redshifted, which makes it appear dimmer in the observed frame. Alternatively, when a star is moving towards us, it's brighter.

But the problem states that the luminosity computed is the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed flux. So perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the luminosity calculation, but only the observed wavelengths. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual temperatures are different due to Doppler shift. So perhaps the formula for luminosity is based on the actual R and T, without any Doppler effect, because luminosity is an intrinsic property.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So perhaps this links the actual temperatures via the Doppler shift. So the approach I took earlier should still hold.

But in that case, I'm getting a luminosity ratio of approximately 2.05, which is not among the options. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed luminosity, but that's not the case here. Luminosity is intrinsic.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step where I need to calculate the emitted luminosity as observed, but the problem says they compute the luminosity as black bodies, which implies using the observed parameters.

Hmm. Let's try a different approach. Let me compute the luminosity ratio using the observed parameters, considering that the observed λ_max is the same for both.

The observed luminosity (apparent brightness) would depend on the actual luminosity, distance, and any redshift effects. But since the problem doesn't mention distance, perhaps it's assuming both stars are at the same distance or that distance doesn't affect the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the stars' luminosities as observed, which would be affected by the Doppler shift.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the luminosity calculation, but the observed λ_max is same, which would relate their actual temperatures.

Wait, but perhaps the luminosity is calculated using the observed flux, which would depend on the Doppler shift. Because flux F = L / (4π d²) ), and for a star moving away, the flux is lower due to the redshift. But the problem says the stars are observed to have the same peak wavelength, which would require their flux peaks to be at the same wavelength.

But since the problem says to compute the luminosity (intrinsic), perhaps I should proceed as before, leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.05, which is not an option, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the mistake is in the Doppler shift calculation. Let's compute (1 + v/c) and (1 - v/c) more accurately.

v =700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s → v/c = 0.002333333.

So,

(1 + v/c) = 1.002333333,

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666667.

So,

sqrt( (1.002333333)/(0.997666667) ) → compute this ratio:

1.002333333 / 0.997666667 ≈ 1.0046875.

So sqrt(1.0046875) ≈ 1.00234.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.00234.

So T2 is 0.234% higher than T1.

Wait, that's a small difference. So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

= (2.25) * ( (1) / (1.00234)^4 )

Compute (1.00234)^4:

1.00234^2 = approx 1.00468.

Then, squared again: (1.00468)^2 ≈ 1.0094.

So,

(1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.0094.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0094 ≈ 2.229.

Ah! That's approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So, I think I made a mistake before by using an incorrect v/c value. I thought v=700 km/s is 0.02333c, but that's incorrect. 700 /3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333333, not 0.02333. I must have made a decimal error earlier.

So the correct v/c is approximately 0.00233333.

So when I recompute,

(1 + v/c) = 1.00233333,

(1 - v/c) = 0.99766667.

Their ratio is:

1.00233333 / 0.99766667 ≈ 1.0046875.

So sqrt(1.0046875) is approx 1.002341.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.002341 → T2 is 0.2341% higher than T1.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.002341 → approx 0.99766 T2.

Now, L1/L2 = ( R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

R1=1.5 R2 → R1²=2.25 R2².

T1 = 0.99766 T2 → T1^4 = (0.99766)^4 T2^4.

Compute (0.99766)^4.

0.99766^2 = approx (1 - 0.00234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2 → 0.99532 + 0.00000547 → 0.995325.

Then, (0.995325)^2 ≈ 0.99065.

So,

(0.99766)^4 ≈ 0.99065.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.99065) → 2.25 * 0.99065 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Radii
The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:
\[
R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \implies \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Relating Temperatures
The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, implying that the observed peak wavelengths are equal. Using Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, the observed wavelength is the same as its actual wavelength:
\[
\lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{1,\text{actual}} = \frac{b}{T_1}
\]

For Star_2, the observed wavelength is affected by its radial velocity \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\). The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:
\[
\lambda_{2,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{actual}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Equating the observed wavelengths:
\[
\lambda_{1,\text{actual}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}}
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{1,\text{actual}} = \frac{b}{T_1}\) and \(\lambda_{2,\text{actual}} = \frac{b}{T_2}\):
\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Canceling \(b\) and rearranging:
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The speed of light \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\), so:
\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Substituting into the temperature ratio:
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx \sqrt{1.0046875} \approx 1.00234
\]

Thus:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.00234 \implies T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1.00234} \approx 0.99766 T_2
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the Luminosity Ratio
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power:
\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99766)^4 \approx 0.99065
\]

Substituting into the luminosity ratio:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99065 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \(2.23\) times that of Star_2.
