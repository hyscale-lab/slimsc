Okay, so I've got this question about transcription factors and mutations. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The scenario says that in an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit is waiting for a signal from a membrane phosphorylation cascade. Once it's phosphorylated on serine residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes. Then it moves into the nucleus and helps in gene transcription.

Now, the question introduces two mutations. The first is mutation X in the transactivation domain, which is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. So, since it's recessive, you need two copies of X to see the effect. Because it's in the transactivation domain, which I think is involved in activating gene expression, a loss-of-function here would probably prevent the transcription factor from working. So, without proper activation, the gene can't be transcribed.

The second mutation is Y, which is a missense mutation in the dimerization domain. The question says it's a dominant-negative mutation. Dominant-negative means the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. So even if you have one copy (heterozygous), it can cause issues.

The question is asking about the molecular phenotype when mutation Y is present. So, let's think about what the dimerization domain does. The transcription factor subunit needs to dimerize, meaning two of them come together, probably to form a functional unit. If mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, it might prevent proper dimerization.

Since Y is dominant-negative, the mutated subunit could interfere with the wild-type subunit. Imagine that each transcription factor is made of two subunits. If one is wild-type and the other is Y, when they try to dimerize, maybe the Y mutation messes up the structure. So the dimer doesn't form properly. Alternatively, the Y mutation could cause the subunits to aggregate or form non-functional dimers.

So what happens to the overall function? Well, the transcription factor can't dimerize correctly, so it can't move into the nucleus and can't activate transcription. So the gene won't be transcribed, leading to a loss of function.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Change of protein conformation and gain-of-function. But Y is dominant-negative and causes loss, so gain of function doesn't fit. Plus, dominant-negative usually leads to loss.

Option B: Protein degradation and loss of wild-type. I'm not sure about degradation. The mutation Y might not cause the protein to be degraded, but instead interfere with its function. Unless the misfolded protein gets tagged for degradation, but I don't think that's the main point here.

Option C: Loss of dimerization and wild-type phenotype. Wait, no. If the dimer can't form, the transcription factor doesn't work. So the phenotype should be loss-of-function, not wild-type.

Option D: Protein aggregation and loss-of-function. Aggregation might happen if the mutant subunits cause the proteins to clump together, making them non-functional. That would lead to a loss of function.

Wait, but does the dominant-negative Y cause the protein to not dimerize, leading to the wild-type not working either? So if someone has one Y and one wild-type allele, the Y might prevent both from functioning. So the presence of Y would lead to loss of function.

So, the mutation Y in a heterozygous state would lead to the transcription factor being unable to dimerize. So the protein can't function, leading to loss of function. Looking at the options again, D says protein aggregation and loss of function. Alternatively, option B mentions protein degradation. I'm trying to think if the dominant-negative effect would cause the protein to aggregate.

Another angle: dominant-negative mutations often cause the formation of non-functional protein complexes. So Y might cause the transcription factor to aggregate or form non-functional dimers. So the presence of Y would lead to a loss of function.

Looking at the options:

Option D: protein aggregation and loss of function.

Yes, that seems right. The mutated subunit could cause the proteins to aggregate, thus preventing them from functioning. So the answer should be D.


The question involves a transcription factor subunit that requires phosphorylation in the transactivation domain to dimerize, move into the nucleus, and facilitate gene transcription. Two mutations are introduced: mutation X in the transactivation domain, which is a recessive loss-of-function mutation, and mutation Y in the dimerization domain, which is a dominant-negative mutation. The task is to determine the molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y.

Mutation Y, being a dominant-negative mutation, disrupts the function of the transcription factor even in a heterozygous state. The dimerization domain is critical for the proper assembly of the transcription factor into functional dimers. A mutation in this domain likely prevents proper dimerization, leading to the formation of non-functional or aggregated protein complexes. This results in a loss of function, as the transcription factor cannot activate gene transcription.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A gain-of-function phenotype is inconsistent with the dominant-negative nature of mutation Y, which causes loss of function.
- **Option B**: While protein degradation could occur in some cases, the primary effect of mutation Y is more likely to be interference with dimerization rather than degradation.
- **Option C**: A wild-type phenotype is incorrect because the dominant-negative mutation disrupts the function of the transcription factor.
- **Option D**: Protein aggregation and loss of function align with the dominant-negative effect of mutation Y, as the mutant subunit likely prevents proper dimerization and leads to non-functional protein complexes.

The most likely molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y is protein aggregation and loss of function.

Answer: D
