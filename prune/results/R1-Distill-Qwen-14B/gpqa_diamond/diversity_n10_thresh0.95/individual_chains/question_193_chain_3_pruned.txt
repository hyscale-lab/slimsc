Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Wait, so the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

Wait, no, wait. Parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula I remember is that distance r (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax. So r = 1 / plx. That makes sense. So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases, because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if I have a region of the sky, and I vary the distance, how does the number of stars in that region change per unit distance? So it's like, as I look further away, how does the star count in that specific region change with each increment in r.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx in terms of r. Since plx = 1/r, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r, then 1/(plx)^5 = (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because when you look further away, the volume increases, but the density of stars might decrease, right? Or does it depend on the distribution?

Wait, but the question says that in that specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax in that specific way. So perhaps the stars are distributed in a certain way. But I think the key is to just mathematically relate N to r.

So N = k * (1 / plx^5 ), and since plx = 1/r, substitute that in: N = k * (r^5
