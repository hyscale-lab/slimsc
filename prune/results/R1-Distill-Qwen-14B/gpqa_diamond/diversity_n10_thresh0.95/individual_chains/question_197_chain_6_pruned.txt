Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and we need to find out the final product. The options are A to D.

First, I should look at the spectral data provided for Compound X. Spectral data usually gives a lot of clues about the structure.

The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests there's a functional group with a strong absorption in that region. The broad peak in that range could be from O-H or N-H. Since the options have either acids or alkenes, maybe it's an O-H stretch. Also, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably from a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the broad peak around 3400 is more likely an O-H of a carboxylic acid because that's usually a broad peak. But wait, the 3400–2500 region could also be from an alcohol or an amine, but in this case, considering the 1720 cm-1, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, a broad singlet at 10.5 would fit better with a carboxylic acid because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 and split into a singlet. But wait, aldehydes would be a triplet if adjacent to CH2, but maybe in some cases, it's a singlet. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Another thought: maybe it's an aldehyde, but that doesn't fit with the IR carbonyl. Because carboxylic acids have O-H, which is present here.

Wait, the IR at 1720 could also be from a ketone. Hmm. But why is there a peak at 10.5 ppm? Let me think: aldehydes have H around 9-10, but maybe a carbonyl as a ketone wouldn't have that. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Let me think again.

The NMR data also shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. So the compound has a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) suggests electron-withdrawing groups. The 7.2 ppm is a doublet, so maybe two protons in each, and the coupling is between adjacent aromatic protons. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, like para-substituted with two groups, or perhaps just one substituent that's activating and deactivating?

Wait, for a para-substituted benzene, the protons would split into two doublets. Like, if the benzene has two substituents in the para positions, like in para-xylene, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with one substituent, but that substituent is such that the protons are split into two doublets. Like if it's a nitro group or a carbonyl group.

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets. Let's think: in a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group, the protons ortho to the substituent would be downfield. But in this case, the substituent could be a carbonyl, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group. So, the benzene ring is attached to a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's a benzaldehyde, but then the IR would have a peak for the aldehyde, but the question doesn't show that. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, like acetophenone. Wait, acetophenone has a ketone peak around 1720, but the NMR would show a singlet around 2.5-2.6 ppm for the CH3 attached to the carbonyl.

Looking at the NMR data: there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Hmm, that seems like a chain of CH2 groups attached to something. Let me think: the 0.9 ppm triplet (t) suggests a terminal CH3. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H is likely a CH(CH3)2 or perhaps a methyl group adjacent to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two adjacent CH2 groups, and the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group connected to a chain. Let me sketch this out. The benzene ring has a substituent, say, a ketone (CO-) attached to a chain. So, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde but with a longer chain.

Wait, looking at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Could be the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. If that's the case, then the IR 1720 would make sense as the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. But wait, carboxylic acids have O-H which is broad, which matches the IR 3400–2500. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the O-H wouldn't be present, so the broad peak would be from an alcohol or from another source.

Wait, if the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (1720). Let me check. Carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch (broad) around 2500-3000, and the carbonyl around 1700. So that fits. So the structure could be a benzoic acid derivative.

Now, the benzene ring has substituents. The NMR shows two doublets in aromatic region. Let me think: for a para-substituted benzoic acid, the ring protons would be split into two doublets. For example, in para-methylbenzoic acid, the H adjacent to the COOH would be downfield and split into a doublet. Similarly, the other two H in the ring would also split into a doublet. That fits with the NMR data: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So the substituent on the benzene ring is a COOH group in the para position, and another group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the benzoic acid would have only the COOH group attached to the benzene. So in that case, the ring would have two substituents: the COOH and another substituent in the para position? That's not possible because para-substituted benzoic acid only has the COOH. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group attached, and another substituent. Or perhaps it's a benzene ring with a COOH group and a side chain.

Wait, the NMR also has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let me think about this. The 0.9 ppm t (3H) is likely a CH2CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group at the end. The 1.4 ppm d (3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-something. The 2.9 ppm (m) could be a CH adjacent to another CH2 group.

Putting it together: Maybe the benzene ring has a COOH group, and a side chain that's a three-carbon group attached. So, perhaps the structure is something like:

Ph-CO-O-R, but wait, no, because the IR shows a carbonyl, but that would be an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a COOH and a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group attached? Or another possibility is that the benzene has a carbonyl group attached, and a chain that branches off.

Wait, the NMR also shows a 1H as a singlet at 10.5. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that would be the -COOH proton, which is typically a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. So the structure is likely a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, another approach: Let's try to figure out the structure of Compound X. The NMR shows a benzene ring with two substituents in the para position (since the two doublets suggest that). One substituent is the COOH group, and another substituent is a side chain. Let's see.

The substituent on the benzene aside from COOH is a chain that includes a CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, the chain in the NMR is:

The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, indicating a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps it's a propyl group. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH (like a CH(CH3)). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be adjacent CH2 groups. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is another CH group.

Wait, putting this together: the substituent on the benzene is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group? No, wait, let's think. The 0.9 t (3H) is CH2CH2CH3, so maybe a butyl group. Because a triplet at 0.9 usually comes from a CH2CH2CH3 (like in ethyl groups). So, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a butyl group attached in the para position.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent could be a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH group connected to the benzene.

Wait, the NMR data has 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Let me imagine the structure:

The benzene ring has a COOH group in position 4 (para) and a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group? Or maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the integration. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks each have 2H, so the benzene ring has two sets of two equivalent protons each. That suggests a para-substituted benzene with a substituent in position 4.

Wait, so the substituents would be in the para positions. So, if the substituent is -COOH and another group, but that's not possible because you can't have two substituents in the same position. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that itself is branched, leading to two sets of protons. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone group, like a benzophenone structure. But then the NMR would have a CH3 attached to the carbonyl. Hmm, but in the given NMR, there's a 2.9 ppm (1H), which doesn't fit a CH3.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the carbonyl. Let me think: The structure could be PhCO-R, where R is a chain.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

- 10.5: possibly the alpha proton to a carbonyl, but that's usually around 9-10 for aldehydes. But if it's a ketone, the alpha protons are usually around 2-3 ppm. Hmm, but 10.5 suggests something else.

Wait, perhaps it's not a carboxylic acid. Let me consider another possibility. Suppose the IR peak at 1720 is a ketone. Then the IR 3400-2500 would have to be something else. Maybe an aldehyde's stretch, but aldehydes are around 2800-2700 (the C-H stretch) and the carbonyl at around 1720. The 10.5 ppm in NMR would then be an aldehyde proton. But wait, in that case, the aldehyde's NMR would usually be around 9.5-10.5, which matches. But the IR would have a strong peak for the aldehyde's C-H (around 2700-2800 cm-1), which is not observed here. The given IR starts at 3400, which is more like O-H or possibly N-H, but not C-H aldehyde.

So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Let's proceed with that.

So, the structure of Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid, where the substituent is a chain. The substituent's NMR data suggests a chain like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but how does that connect?

Wait, the substituent on the benzene would have to be a group that's attached to the ring. Considering the NMR peaks:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is a terminal methyl group, likely part of an ethyl chain (CH2CH3). The triplet suggests two neighboring CH2 groups.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two adjacent CH2 groups.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group connected to other CH2 groups.

So the structure could be a benzene ring with a COOH group and a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group attached. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached. Wait, maybe a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The substituent would be a side chain attached to the benzene. Let's say, for the substituent chain, it's a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, benzene connected to a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but wait, the NMR data ends with a terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm, which suggests a longer chain.

Alternatively, it's a butyl group. Let me think: the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a branch. The 0.9 ppm is a CH2CH3 group, so maybe it's a propyl group attached to a CH which has a methyl group. So the chain would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group? No, wait, but the substituent is a single chain.

Wait, the substituent could be a CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, benzene ring attached to a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. But then the NMR would have peaks for each of these.

Wait, another approach: Let's build the structure.

The benzene ring has a COOH group in the para position to another substituent. The substituent is a chain that is (CH2)2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. But then we have the following structure:

Ph-COOH
|
CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Wait, no, that would make the substituent a four-carbon chain, but the NMR suggests a longer chain.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but red phosphorus with HI is used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, another possibility: If Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI might lead to some kind of substitution. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps Compound X is a benzene ring with a ketone group (CO-) and an alkoxy group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the reaction. When a compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's often a type of substitution, such as the replacement of a halide with another group, but in this case, I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: If Compound X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone), then reacting with H I and red phosphorus could be a reduction. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI might be used in the presence of a carbonyl to form a ylide, which could lead to an addition reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a Wittig reaction setup. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the question says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. For example, if X has a leaving group, like a bromide, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might substitute it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a benzaldehyde derivative, reacting with HI and red phosphorus might lead to the formation of an alkane via the Clemmensen-like reduction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis. If X is an ester, then hydrolysis with acid (HI isn't typically for hydrolysis; perhaps more likely in aqueous conditions). But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the spectral data to get the structure of X.

The IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are around the C=C stretching regions, so perhaps there's a double bond in the molecule. Alternatively, they could be from aromatic C=C bonds. But if the benzene ring is present, those peaks would be from the ring. So that makes sense.

So, putting everything together, the structure of X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a chain substituent.

The benzene ring has a COOH group at one position and a chain substituent in the para position. The chain is probably a propyl group with a branch. Let's think about the chain.

The NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): CH2CH2CH3
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): CH(CH3)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group

So the chain could be: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not sure. Wait, the 1.7 ppm (2H) would be the CH2 groups adjacent to the CH and the CH3. The 2.9 ppm (1H) would be the CH between the two CH2 groups and the CH(CH3). The 0.9 ppm is the terminal CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. That would give a structure like:

Ph-COOH
|
CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

But where does the terminal CH3 come into play? Because the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which would suggest two neighboring CH2 groups. So perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that seems too long.

Wait, another approach: The substituent is a propyl group with a branch. So, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. No, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. Then the NMR would have a triplet for the CH2 group attached to the CH(CH3)2. But I don't see that.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's think: the substituent is a butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure would be Ph-COOH and a butyl group in the para position. But the NMR doesn't show four CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)2. Then, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 attached to the C(CH3)2, and the methyl groups would be a singlet. But in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH, not a C(CH3)2.

Alternatively, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: The substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the substituent would be a 3-methylbutyl group? No, perhaps a 2-methylpropyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Let me think: that would be a pentyl group with a branch. The NMR would show:

- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t)
- The CH2 adjacent to the CH(CH3) at 1.7 ppm (m)
- The CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm (m)
- The CH2 attached to the benzene at
