Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. They observed the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, and those are the same. Hmm, wait, the brightest wavelength for a star usually relates to its temperature. Oh right, because hotter objects emit more at shorter wavelengths. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because of Wien's law, which is λ_max * T = constant.

So, if both have the same λ_max, their temperatures T are equal. That's an important point. So T1 = T2.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. They said that the computed luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. And the options are given.

I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) depends on its radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Alternatively, since the constants can be combined, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the T part becomes 1, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelengths? Oh, right, this is about the Doppler effect. The radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler shift.

So, if the star is moving away, its light is redshifted, and if moving towards us, blueshifted. The formula for Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but wait, I think I might have that a bit wrong. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the Doppler shift formula for recessional velocity is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), assuming v is much smaller than c. But I'm a bit shaky on the exact formula.

Wait, let me think. The observed wavelength λ' from a source moving with velocity v relative to the observer is given by λ' = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), where λ0 is the emitted wavelength. But more commonly, if v is much smaller than c, then λ' ≈ λ0 (1 + v/c). But since the problem says that the peak wavelengths are the same, maybe the Doppler effect has to be considered here.

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, if the stars have the same λ_max, but their actual emission peaks are at the same observed wavelength, but their rest wavelengths might be different.

Wait, no. Wait a second, perhaps the peak wavelengths observed are the same. So the emitted wavelengths would be different if the stars are moving at different velocities.

Wait, let's clarify. The observed wavelength λ_obs is the same for both stars. But the emitted wavelength λ_emit depends on the star's rest frame. So, for each star, λ_emit = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), assuming they are moving away (v positive for recession). Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, when a source is moving away, the observed wavelength increases (redshift), so λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). If v is positive for recession, then λ_obs > λ_emit.

So, assuming that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, we can write:

λ_emit1 = λ_obs / (1 + v1/c)

λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)

But since λ_emit is the rest wavelength, which for a blackbody is determined by its temperature. So, for each star, λ_emit relates to T via Wien's law: λ_emit * T = b (constant, Wien's displacement law).

So, for each star, λ_emit = b / T.

But if the observed λ_max is the same for both, then the actual emitted wavelengths would differ by the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_obs.

So, let me write the equations for each star.

For Star 1:

λ_emit1 = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v1/c)/(1 + v1/c) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Wait, when a source is moving away, the observed wavelength λ' is longer than the emitted λ. So the formula is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but actually, the exact formula is λ' = λ * ( (1 + v/c)/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) ) ). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/c).

But the problem gives a velocity of 700 km/s for Star 2. Let me calculate v/c. Speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 is about 0.002333. So v/c is about 0.002333, which is small, so the approximation should hold.

So for Star_1, v1 is 0 km/s. So the observed wavelength λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 * (1 + 0) = λ_emit1.

Star_2 has v2 = 700 km/s, so λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c) ≈ λ_emit2 * (1 + 0.002333)

But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same: λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_obs.

So, λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

Star_2's λ_emit2 is λ_obs / (1 + v2/c) = λ_emit1 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, no. Because λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs.

So, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_emit1 = b / T1, and λ_emit2 = b / T2.

Wait, but I thought the temperatures are the same, but maybe they aren't. Because if the observed λ_obs is the same, but the Doppler shifts are different, then the actual λ_emit would be different, leading to different temperatures.

Wait, but if the observed λ is the same and the Doppler shifts are different, then the emitted wavelengths are different, meaning the temperatures must be different. Because from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T.

So, let me think again. Suppose that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So, for Star1, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 (since v1=0). For Star2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c). Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

But according to Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T. So,

λ_emit1 = b / T1,

λ_emit2 = b / T2.

Thus,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Rearranged,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but wait, if Star1 is not moving, its emitted wavelength is λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

Star2 is moving away, so its emitted wavelength λ_emit2 is shorter than λ_obs. Because when a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). 

From Wien's law, λ_emit is inversely proportional to T. So, if λ_emit2 < λ_emit1, then T2 > T1. So, T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, so that would mean that the temperature of Star2 is higher than Star1. Because Star2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is higher than its emitted. So, its emitted wavelength is shorter, which implies higher temperature.

But wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So, if Star2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength (which is λ_emit2) is shorter than the observed wavelength. So, let's re-examine.

Given:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 (since v1=0).

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

From Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T.

So,

λ_emit1 = (b / T1),

λ_emit2 = (b / T2).

So substituting into the previous equation,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Multiply both sides by T1 T2,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c).

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

700 over 3e5 is about 0.002333, so 1 + 0.002333 is approximately 1.002333.

So,

T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 is about 0.233% higher than T1.

Wait, but the initial assumption in the problem is that the mass and radius of Star1 are 1.5 times that of Star2. Wait, no, actually, Star1 has radius 1.5 times that of Star2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

Wait, that's important because earlier I thought the luminosity ratio depends on R^2 and T^4. Hmm.

So, the luminosity formula is L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = ( (1.5 R2 / R2 )^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Which is (1.5)^2 * ( (T1)/(T2) )^4.

Wait, but from earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So,

(L1/L2) = (1.5)^2 * (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute each part.

(1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(0.99767)^4. Let's compute that.

0.99767 is approximately 0.9977.

0.9977^2 is approximately (1 - 0.0023)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0023 + (0.0023)^2 ≈ ~0.9954.

Again, 0.9954 squared is (approx) (1 - 0.0046)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0046 + (0.0046)^2 ≈ ~0.9909.

But wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 0.99767^4.

Alternatively, take natural logs.

ln(0.99767) ≈ -0.002333 (since ln(1-x) ≈ -x for small x).

So, ln(0.99767^4) =4 * (-0.002333) ≈ -0.009332.

Exp(-0.009332) ≈ 1 -0.009332 + (0.009332)^2/2 - ... ≈ approx 0.9908.

So, about 0.9908.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.228.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which matches this.

Wait, but wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler effect part.

Because, when the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So, the emitted wavelength (what the star actually emits) is shorter than the observed. So, if the observed λ is the same for both, but Star2 is moving away, its emitted λ is shorter than Star1's emitted λ.

But from Wien's law, a shorter emitted λ implies higher temperature. So, T2 > T1.

Which is what I had before.

Thus, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 is 1.5, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25.

(T1/T2) is 1/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99766.

So, (0.99766)^4 ≈ 0.9908.

So, 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.228. So approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So option D is the correct answer.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Key Relationships**:
   - Luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by \( L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature.
   - The luminosity ratio is therefore \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \).

2. **Given Data**:
   - \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \).
   - The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)).
   - Star_1 has a radial velocity of \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), and Star_2 has \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

3. **Doppler Effect and Temperature**:
   - The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler shift formula: \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v/c) \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
   - For Star_1 (\( v_1 = 0 \)), \( \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs}} \).
   - For Star_2 (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)), \( \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + v_2/c} \).
   - Since the observed wavelengths are the same, the emitted wavelengths differ due to the Doppler effect. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T \)), the temperature ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{v_2}{c}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_1} \approx 1 + \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 1.002333.
     \]
   - Thus, \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767 \).

4. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - Substituting into the luminosity formula:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
     \]
   - Using \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \) and \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99767 \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4.
     \]
   - Compute each term:
     \[
     (1.5)^2 = 2.25, \quad (0.99767)^4 \approx 0.9908.
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9908 \approx 2.228.
     \]

5. **Answer Selection**:
   - The closest option to \( 2.228 \) is \( \sim 2.23 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
