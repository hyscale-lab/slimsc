Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(parallax)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. So I need to relate parallax to distance and then see how the number of stars depends on that.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So distance (r) = 1 / parallax (plx). Oh right, so plx = 1/r.

The problem states that the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So substituting plx with 1/r, that would make N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me calculate that: (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, N varies with 1/(plx)^5, so plx is 1/r. So 1/(plx)^5 is (r)^5. So N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5.

But wait, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So they want the rate of change, like the derivative maybe? Or maybe it's about the change in number as you go from r to r + dr. Hmm, wait, perhaps not. Let me read the question again.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/(r), then N ∝ r^5. So for each increase in r, the number of stars increases by r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit distance. Oh wait, perhaps they're asking about the differential, the change in N with r. Like dN/dr.

If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. But the options don't have 5. The options are about how N itself varies with r, not the rate of change. Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars [...] change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Hmm, maybe they're asking about the number density, like the number per unit distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, the options are about the number of stars varying with distance. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem says: the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/r. So 1/plx^5 = r^5. Hence, N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive.
