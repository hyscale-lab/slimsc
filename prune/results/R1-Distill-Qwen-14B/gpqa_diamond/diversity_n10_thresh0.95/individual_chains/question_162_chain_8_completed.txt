Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, metrics describe the geometry of spacetime, and the area can be found using integration over the surface.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, because for a pseudosphere, which is a type of black hole solution in 2D, the metric should be of the form that's similar to the Schwarzschild metric but in 2D. But in this case, the metric is written in terms of x and y coordinates, which is unusual because I think usually these metrics are written in terms of r and θ or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about what this metric represents. The standard Schwarzschild metric in 2D (which would be a 2-dimensional spacetime, so a line element in 1+1 dimensions) is usually written as ds² = -(1 - 2M/r) dt² + (1 - 2M/r)^-1 dr². But that's for a spherically symmetric solution, so maybe this metric is using x and y coordinates instead. Or perhaps it's a different approach.

But the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is another term for a 2-dimensional black hole. The area would typically refer to the area of the event horizon, right? The event horizon is at r = 2M for a Schwarzschild black hole. But wait, in this problem, the radius r is given as 2. So maybe M is 2 here, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). That denominator looks like (4 - (x² + y²)), which is like 4 minus the squared radius. So if we let s² = x² + y², then 4 - s² would be the denominator. 

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the coordinates here. Maybe they're using polar coordinates, but expressed in terms of x and y. Let me think. If x and y are Cartesian coordinates, then s² = x² + y² is the radial distance squared. So 4 - s² is like the denominator. So the metric becomes ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but wait, no, because the original expression is dx² + dy². Oh wait, if x and y are polar coordinates, then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². But in the given metric, it's written as dx² + dy², which suggests that they are Cartesian coordinates, not polar. Hmm, maybe I should transform to polar coordinates to find the area element.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the area by looking at the metric. The area element in 2D is usually sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, but the metric given is in terms of dx² and dy², so the metric tensor is diagonal.

Let me write it in matrix form. The metric tensor g has components g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms g_xy and g_yx are zero. So the determinant of the metric tensor, which is g, is (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

So the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, but wait, in two dimensions, if the metric is diagonal, the area element is (1/sqrt(g)) dx dy. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the area element is dA = sqrt(det g) dx dy. Because the determinant for a diagonal metric is (g_xx * g_yy), so sqrt(det g) is sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) = g_xx, since g_xx = g_yy in this case. So dA = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). So the area would be the integral of dA over the region where the denominator is positive, because the metric would be real there. So 4 - (x² + y²) > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the region of integration is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin in the x-y plane.

So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can use polar coordinates. Let me switch variables to r and θ. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The area integral becomes:

Integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the area is 32 * ∫ (r dr dθ) / (4 - r²) integrated over r from 0 to 2 and θ from 0 to 2π.

Let me compute the integral step by step.

First, factor out the constants. So 32 * ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the θ integral first. The integral of dθ from 0 to 2π is 2π.

So the area becomes 32 * 2π * ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Now compute the radial integral ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r² → du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] = ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / u = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

But our substitution is u =4 - r², so when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=4 - (2)^2=0.

So the integral from r=0 to r=2 becomes:

[ (-1/2) ln u ] evaluated from u=4 to u=0.

Wait, but when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln u approaches negative infinity. So this would make the integral diverge. Because as the upper limit approaches 2, u approaches 0, so the integral becomes (-1/2)( ln 0 - ln 4) = (-1/2)( -∞ - ln4 ) → which would be positive infinity.

Wait, but wait, let me re-express that. The substitution gives:

∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = [ (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) ) ] evaluated from 0 to 2.

At r=2, 4 - r² = 0 → ln(0) is -infinity. So it's (-1/2) ( -∞ - ln4 ) → which is positive infinity. So the integral diverges.

Wait, but that suggests that the area is infinite. So the area of the pseudosphere would be infinite?

Wait, but in the options, option D is +infty. So that would be the answer. But wait, am I making a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps the metric is written in a way that the area is finite. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the x and y here aren't the same as radial coordinates. Because the metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). That might be a conformally flat metric, where the spatial part is conformal to flat space.

Wait, but in the case of a black hole, the area should be finite. Because the event horizon is a 2-sphere with finite area. Oh wait, but in 2D, the event horizon would be a circle, not a sphere. So perhaps in this case, the "pseudosphere" refers to a 2-dimensional surface, but the term is a bit confusing.

Wait, the Schwarzschild metric in 2D would have an area of 4πM, where M is the mass parameter. So if M=2, the area would be 8π. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the radius is 2, so the area would be 4πr² = 16π, but again, not matching the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A) 0 → seems unlikely.

Option B) 4π(x² + y²) → that's a function of x and y, which doesn't make sense for an area; area should be a number.

Option C) 4π(x² - y²) → same issue as B.

Option D) +infty → which would make sense if the integral diverges, as I calculated earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the metric is in (1+1) dimensions, so the area I'm calculating is the circumference or something else. No, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere, which I think refers to the area of the event horizon. But perhaps the metric is written in a way that the area is infinite, but that doesn't make sense because the event horizon should have finite area.

Wait, another approach: the pseudosphere in 2D is a spacetime with metric ds² = -(1 - (r_s/r)) dt² + (1 - r_s/r)^-1 dr², where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius, 2M. So for r_s=2, the metric becomes ds² = -(1 - 2/r) dt² + (1 - 2/r)^-1 dr².

But the given metric is different. It's written as (32/(4 - x² - y²))(dx² + dy²). Maybe this is the spatial part of the metric, in which case, the volume (area) of the universe would be finite if the space is compact.

Wait, but in that case, the integral I did earlier would be over the entire space. But the denominator 4 - (x² + y²) suggests that the maximum x² + y² is 4, so the space is a 2D disk of radius 2. But the area element is 32/(4 - r²) r dr dθ. So when integrating, as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the area element blow up. So the total area would be infinite.

Wait, but that seems contradictory because the universe in this model is a finite disk. So why does the area become infinite?

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is written in a way that the spatial part is a hyperbolic space. Wait, for example, the metric might resemble that of hyperbolic space, which has infinite area.

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle of radius R is 2π (cosh R - 1), which is finite for finite R but would approach infinity as R approaches infinity. But in our case, the metric is 32/(4 - r²) times the area element, so as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, which makes the area element go to infinity. So even though the maximum r is 2, the area integral would diverge.

So the only way this makes sense is that the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute the area, the area element \( dA \) is derived from the metric. For a 2D metric, the area element is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \det g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor is diagonal, with components \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), and the determinant is:

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is where the metric is real, which requires \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), or equivalently, \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This corresponds to a circular region of radius 2 centered at the origin in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \( \theta \):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int \frac{du}{u}.
\]

Evaluating this from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 2 \), corresponding to \( u = 4 \) to \( u = 0 \), gives:

\[
-16 \left[\ln|u|\right]_4^0 = -16 \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

As \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the total area is infinite.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is a function of \( x \) and \( y \), not a numerical value.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, for the same reason as B.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the integral diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Answer: D
