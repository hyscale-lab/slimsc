Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics and boson decay. Hmm, let's try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through step by step.

The question provides a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I should parse this correctly. Oh right, probably it's L = -λ_f ψ_f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this looks like a Yukawa coupling kind of term. The boson X is interacting with fermion fields ψ_f, which are probably Dirac fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the possible kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, the decay products need to have enough mass to be created.

In particle physics, when a boson decays into fermions, it has to produce a pair of particles because fermions are matter particles and have to come in pairs (like a particle and its antiparticle) to conserve charge, baryon number, etc. So X can decay into a pair like ff̄.

The possible decays would depend on which fermions are allowed by the Lagrangian. Looking at the interaction term: the fermion field is ψ_f. So f represents the type of fermion. The options list various fermion pairs, like b b̄, c c̄, etc.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian given is written as -λ_f ψ_f̄ (v + X) ψ_f. So ψ_f is a Dirac spinor, and the interaction is with X. That means that the boson X can couple to any fermion f in the theory. But wait, no, not exactly. Because in the Standard Model, Yukawa couplings are specific to each fermion. So if the Lagrangian is written with ψ_f, that suggests that X couples to all fermions f. But perhaps the question is more general, and X can decay into any fermion pair, provided the mass allows it.

But wait, in reality, the couplings don't always exist for all fermions. For example, the Higgs field couples to up-type quarks, down-type quarks, and leptons. But in this case, the Lagrangian implies that X couples universally to all fermions f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass of the fermion is less than half the mass of X.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay pair must have a mass less than 3 GeV because 2m < M_X. That's the condition for a decay to be kinematically allowed.

So which fermions have a mass less than 3 GeV? Let me think about the masses of known fermions.

Top quark is way heavier, like 173 GeV, so no way. Bottom is around 4.5 GeV, so 4.5 is more than 3. So bottom quark can't be produced because 2m would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So no b quark decays.

Charm quark is about 1.5 GeV. So 2m would be about 3 GeV. So 6 GeV is twice that, so that's allowed. So c c̄ is possible.

Same for strange quark: about 100 MeV, so 2m is 0.2 GeV, well below 6 GeV. So s s̄ is allowed.

Up and down quarks are even lighter—like around a few MeV each. So u ū and d d̄ are definitely allowed.

For leptons: the tau lepton is about 1.77 GeV. So 2m is 3.54, which is more than 3. So tau can't be produced. Wait, 3.54 is more than 3, but the X mass is 6 GeV. Wait, 2m needs to be less than or equal to M_X. So for tau, 2m is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be produced. Wait wait, no, 3.54 is less than 6, so it's allowed. Wait, no, I think I got confused. The mass of the X is 6 GeV. Each fermion must have a mass less than half of that, so m < 3 GeV.

Tau mass is about 1.77 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So tau can be produced. So tau+ tau- is allowed.

What about electrons and muons? Their masses are negligible compared to GeV scales. So e+ e- and mu+ mu- are allowed.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? Its mass is around 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So 2m would be 9 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks.

So the possible decay products are:

c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-, mu+ mu-.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b is too heavy as I thought. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So B includes c, which is allowed, and tau, mu, e. Yes. So that's a possibility.

Option C: Includes top quark? No, because top is too heavy, so C is out.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, D includes b, which is not allowed, so D is out.

Wait, but let me double-check the fermion masses. Let me list the approximate masses:

electron: ~0.0005 GeV

muon: ~0.105 GeV

tau: ~1.777 GeV

up quark: ~0.003 GeV

down quark: ~0.004 GeV

strange quark: ~0.095 GeV

charm quark: ~1.27 GeV

bottom quark: ~4.1-4.7 GeV (average ~4.5)

top quark: ~173 GeV.

Wait, so tau is about 1.77 GeV, so each is under 3 GeV. So 2m is 3.54, which is less than 6 GeV, yes. So tau pair is allowed.

So the allowed fermions are:

c, s, u, d, tau, e, mu.

So the decay products would be c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-, mu+ mu-.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is:

c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones.

So the answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair (\( f\bar{f} \)), provided the fermion mass \( m_f \) satisfies the condition \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This means each fermion mass must be less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of known fermions are approximately:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these masses, the fermions with \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( c, s, u, d, \tau, e, \mu \). Therefore, the allowed decays of \( X \) are:

\[
X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the bottom quark mass (\( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)) exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), which matches the allowed decays. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark mass (\( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) is far greater than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. Hence, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
