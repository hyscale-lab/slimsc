Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and it's 1.1 solar masses. When it doesn't have any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So, the key concepts here are probably about the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a star's atmosphere. Since the star is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the Boltzmann equation applies.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k T))

Where:
- n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two energy levels
- g_i and g_j are their statistical weights
- E_i and E_j are their energies
- k is Boltzmann's constant
- T is the temperature

The ratio given in the problem is n1/n2. When the star has spots, the overall T_eff drops, so the ratio changes.

Wait, no. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So the factor we're looking for is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, the temperature when the star has spots is T2 = 5500 K, and T1 is 6000 K when it doesn't have spots.

But wait, the spots are cooler regions. So when a star has spots, part of its surface is cooler, but the rest is normal. However, the problem states that the overall effective temperature decreases. So, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, but the star isn't all spots, just 40% of the surface. So, the photosphere as a whole has a lower effective temperature.

Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So, n1/n2 is lower when the star has spots.

But we're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But wait, perhaps we need to consider the change in the ratio of the populations based on the change in temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% spots. But wait, does that mean that the average temperature is 5500 K, or that the star's overall luminosity is such that its effective temperature is 5500 K? Or perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature, but the rest of the photosphere is at the original 6000 K.

Wait, that's a crucial point. The problem states that when 40% is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? Or does it mean that the average Teff is lower because part of the surface is cooler.

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think. The effective temperature of a star is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the total luminosity to the surface area and effective temperature. So, when part of the surface is cooler, the overall luminosity decreases, and thus the effective temperature would be lower.

But in this scenario, the star's overall Teff is given as 5500 K when 40% of its surface is spotted. So the average temperature is lower. But how does this affect the photospheric temperature? For the purpose of the problem, I think we can assume that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when the spots are present. But wait, maybe not. Because the problem says when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere isn't uniformly at 5500 K; instead, some parts are at 6000 K and others are at a lower temperature (the spots, which are presumably much cooler, like maybe 4000 K or something?).

But wait, the problem doesn't give the temperature of the spots. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the stellar photosphere. So the issue is that the average temperature of the photosphere (as it relates to the emitted flux) is lower when spots are present. But, wait, the photosphere itself, the regions not covered by spots, are at 6000 K. The spots are cooler, but perhaps the question is assuming that the photosphere is at a lower average temperature when there are spots.

Wait, no, that might not make sense. Let me think again.

The star's surface is not covered by spots, so Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the Teff drops to 5500 K. So the average flux is lower because some parts are emitting less. But the regions not covered by spots are still at 6000 K. However, the problem says the "overall photospheric effective temperature" decreases. So perhaps the entire photosphere's effective temperature is considered to be 5500 K.

Wait, no. That might not be accurate because the presence of spots (which are cooler) would decrease the average flux, making the star's effective temperature lower. But the photosphere itself isn't all at 5500 K; only part is cooler.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. The problem states that the photosphere's effective temperature decreases. So perhaps for the purposes of this question, we are to treat the photosphere as being at 5500 K when the spots are present. But that doesn't seem right because the spots are cooler regions, not the entire photosphere. Wait, but the part of the photosphere that is spotted is at a lower temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's photosphere, when spots are present, has a certain average temperature, which is 5500 K. But that's not how I usually think about it. I think that the star's overall effective temperature when spots are present is 5500 K, but the spots themselves are cooler than the rest, which is at 6000 K.

Wait, but the problem says that the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. So maybe the photosphere is now emitting as if it were at 5500 K.

But that might not be correct. The effective temperature is an average based on the total luminosity. So, the presence of spots would lower the overall luminosity, so the Teff is lower, but the photosphere isn't uniformly at that lower temperature. Only parts of it are at lower temperatures.

Hmm, but then how does that affect the ratio of the Ti levels? Because the Ti atoms are in the photosphere. So, if some regions are cooler and some are hotter, then the average population would be a combination.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two levels is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, perhaps the average temperature is such that the ratio changes. But I think the confusion here is whether the effective temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present or whether the effective Teff is 5500 K, but the actual photospheric temperature is a mix.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at a lower temperature when spots are present. But that doesn't make sense because the spots are just parts of the surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the effective temperature of the star is 5500 K, which is a result of the spots covering 40% of the surface. So, the photosphere's average temperature is a combination of the spotted and non-spotted regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and assuming that the entire photosphere's temperature effectively drops to 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be correct.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% is covered, the Teff is 5500 K. So, the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when spots are present.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So, the photosphere's temperature is a mix of spots and non-spots. But how does that affect the line ratio?

Hmm, perhaps each region (spotted and non-spotted) has its own temperature, and the observed line ratio is a combination of the two. But that seems complicated, maybe beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be the case because the spots are cooler, but the rest is at 6000 K.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. If the photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K and lower temperatures, then the average ratio would depend on the contribution from each region.

But that would complicate things. Maybe the problem is simplifying and considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, so we can model it as a single temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when spots cover 40% of the surface, the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K. So, the photospheric temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when they aren't.

Wait, but the photosphere's own temperature isn't the same as the effective temperature of the star. The effective temperature is a measure of the total radiation. So, when 40% is covered by spots, the star emits less total radiation, so Teff is lower. But the actual photosphere's temperature isn't uniform. So, perhaps the problem is treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, but that's not accurate.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. The question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio depends on the temperature because the Boltzmann factor depends on T.

So, when the temperature decreases, the ratio n1/n2 (as given by the Boltzmann equation) will change. Let's model each case.

In the no-spot scenario, the photosphere is at T1=6000 K. In the with-spot scenario, perhaps the photosphere is at T2=5500 K. Or wait, no, the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when spots are present, but the actual photospheric temperature in the unspotted regions is still 6000 K, and the spotted regions are cooler.

But the problem states that the ratio observed in the photosphere decreases when the star has spots. So, perhaps the average effect is that the photosphere's temperature is lower on average, leading to a lower ratio.

Wait, but if the star's photosphere is a mix of regions at different temperatures, the observed line ratio would be a combination. But without knowing the exact temperature of the spots, it's hard to compute. So, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, which is an average of the unspotted and spotted regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that the effective temperature of the photosphere (as observed) is 5500 K when spots are present. So, perhaps the photosphere's temperature is 5500 K in that case.

If that's the case, then the change in the ratio can be computed using the Boltzmann equation.

The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

Assuming that g1 and g2 are the same or that their ratio doesn't change, the ratio of the ratios would be the ratio of the exponential terms.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Let's see.

Let me compute the ratio for T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K.

The ratio R = (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so R = exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k T2) - (E1-E2)/(k T1) ] )

Wait, because R is (n1/n2)_T1 divided by (n1/n2)_T2. So that's [ exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp( (E1-E2)/(k T2) - (E1-E2)/(k T1) ) )

Factor out (E1-E2)/k:

= exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Hmm.

Wait, but I need the energy difference between the two levels. The problem says that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So, the energy difference can be found using the wavelength.

The energy difference ΔE = hc / λ.

Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength in meters.

So, let's compute ΔE.

Given λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) )

Wait, let me compute that:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

To convert that into eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Hmm, that's a pretty large energy difference. But wait, that might not be right. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

So ΔE = hc / λ = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = 1.372e-18 J.

Yes, that's correct. Then converting to eV: 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Hmm, that's a big energy gap. So, E1 - E2 = ΔE = 8.56 eV.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is (E_i - E_j)/(k T). So, (E1-E2) is ΔE.

So, plugging in the numbers:

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, (ΔE) / (k T) = (8.56 eV) / ( (8.617e-5 eV/K) * T )

Let me compute this value for T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K.

At T1=6000 K:

X1 = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 * 6000) = 8.56 / (0.517) ≈ 16.55

At T2=5500 K:

X2 = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 * 5500) = 8.56 / (0.4739) ≈ 18.06

Wait, so X1 is 16.55, X2 is 18.06.

So, the exponent in R is (X2 - X1) = 18.06 – 16.55 = 1.51.

So, R = exp(1.51) ≈ e^1.51 ≈ 4.52.

So, the ratio R is approximately 4.52.

Wait, but wait a minute. The ratio R is (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2. So, when the temperature drops, does the ratio increase or decrease?

Wait, when T decreases, the exponent (ΔE)/(k T) increases because T is in the denominator. So, n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so when T decreases, -ΔE/(k T) becomes more negative, so the exponential becomes smaller. So, n1/n2 decreases when T decreases.

In our problem, when the star has spots, T is 5500 K (lower), so n1/n2 is lower. So the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = R ≈ 4.52.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches this.

But wait a second, I just computed R as exp(1.51)=~4.5, which would be the factor. So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.

But wait, I should double-check the calculation of X2 - X1.

Wait, let's compute X1 and X2 more accurately.

X1 = (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) = 8.56 / (0.51702) ≈ 16.55

X2 = (8.56) / (8.617e-5 *5500) = 8.56/(0.473935) ≈ 18.06

So X2 - X1 is 18.06 - 16.55 = 1.51. So exp(1.51) is about 4.52.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (T₁ = 6000 K) to having spots (T₂ = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The ratio of the populations at two temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta E\)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert \(\Delta E\) to electron volts (1 eV = \(1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the factor
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\), \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99352.3.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99352.3 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right) = \exp(1.51) \approx 4.52.
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes is approximately 4.5.

### Final Answer:
From the given options, the closest value is **C) ~4.5**.
