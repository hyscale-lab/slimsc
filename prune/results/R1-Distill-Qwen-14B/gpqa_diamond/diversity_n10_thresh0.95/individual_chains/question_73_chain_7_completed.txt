Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut A is 2m at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m at 0.5c.

The question has two parts: relative speed and total energy of the system. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities directly because of the effects of special relativity. So, for the relative speed, I probably need to use the velocity addition formula from relativity.

Wait, the velocity addition formula. Right, it's (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, that's when both velocities are measured in the same frame. Here, I think the relative speed is between the two astronauts, so if they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their velocities, adjusted for relativity.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, so from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should calculate the relative velocity of one with respect to the other. Let's think: if A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving slower by 0.1c, but because of relativity, it's not that simple. So I need to apply the velocity addition formula correctly.

Wait, the formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c^2)), where u is the velocity of the object and v is the velocity of the frame. So if I'm in A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c, then B's velocity in the lab frame is 0.5c. So u is 0.5c, and v is 0.6c. So plugging into the formula, v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction; since we're talking about speed, the magnitude is 0.142857c, approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, both C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy in relativity includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, sometimes people mean the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

Each astronaut's relativistic energy is given by gamma * m c². So for astronaut A: gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v = 0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36.

So for A: gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A: E_A = gamma_A * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: v = 0.5c. v²/c² = 0.25.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding both energies: E_total ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So the correct total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the right answer should have v_rel=0.14c and E≈5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So the correct answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of astronaut B in the lab frame) and \( v = 0.6c \) (velocity of astronaut A in the lab frame). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut A (\( m = 2m, v = 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For astronaut B (\( m = 3m, v = 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: C**
