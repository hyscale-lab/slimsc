Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So parallax is a measure of how far away a star is from us. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. Wait, no, wait—parallax is actually inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is actually closer because parallax p (in parsecs) is 1/d, where d is the distance. So if a star is 10 parsecs away, its parallax is 0.1 arcseconds. Got it.

Now the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed probably means that in terms of space, stars are spread out equally in all directions. So the number density is the same everywhere. But how does that translate to the number of stars per unit parallax?

I remember that in three-dimensional space, the number of stars you can observe depends on the volume of space you're looking into. So for a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding volume?

Parallax p is 1/d, so distance d = 1/p. So when p increases (meaning the star is farther away), d decreases. Wait no, wait. If p increases, d decreases because d=1/p. Oh right, because a larger p means the star is closer, since parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

So if I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d, which corresponds to a parallax p = 1/d. The thickness of this shell in terms of distance would be dr. But since we're considering parallax, dr would translate into a change in p. Let me think about how dr relates to dp.

Since p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. Oh wait, that's calculus. So dr is dd, which is the thickness in distance. The change in parallax dp would be - (1/d²) * dr. So dr = - d² dp.

But wait, when we're looking at a range of parallax, from p to p + dp, the corresponding distance goes from d = 1/p to d + dd = 1/(p + dp). Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to the volume of that shell, multiplied by the number density of stars. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dr. So N = n * 4π d² dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But since we want it per unit parallax, we need to relate dr to dp. From p = 1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dr. So dr = - d² dp. But since we're dealing with positive distances and parallax, maybe the negative just indicates direction, which we can ignore for magnitude purposes, so dr = d² |dp|.

Substituting d = 1/p, dr = (1/p²) dp. So N = n * 4π (1/p²)^2 * (1/p² dp)? Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check:

Wait, the volume is 4π d² dr. And d is 1/p, so substituting d =1/p, we get:

Volume = 4π (1/p²) dr.

But dr in terms of dp is dr = (1/p²) dp, from earlier. So substituting dr into the volume:

Volume = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me go through it again.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = n * 4π d² dr.

But since p = 1/d, dr = (1/p²) dp. So substituting into N:

N = n *4π d² * (1/p²) dp.

But d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p². So:

N = n *4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (d p) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So for a given dp, the number is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number density in terms of parallax is N ∝ 1/p^4.

But wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx."

So as plx increases, the number per unit plx changes as 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options:

A) ~ 1/plx^4

B) ~ 1/plx^2

C) ~ 1/plx^1

D) ~ 1/plx^3.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but why is it 1/p^4 and not some other power? Because the volume element in terms of parallax leads to the fourth power of p.

Alternatively, think about the differential volume in terms of parallax. Let me approach it in another way.

The number of stars at a parallax between p and p + dp is N = n * Volume.

Volume between p and p+dp is the volume of a spherical shell at distance d=1/p, with thickness dr, but we need to find how that volume changes with p.

Alternatively, the volume between p and p+dp is the volume of a sphere of radius 1/p minus the sphere of radius 1/(p+dp). But for small dp, it's approximately the surface area times dr.

Wait, maybe using the shell approach is better.

Wait, the volume of a spherical shell between p and p + dp is the same as the volume between distance d and d+dd, where d=1/p, and dd is the change in d.

The volume between d and d+dd is 4π d² dd.

But dd can be expressed in terms of dp. Since p = 1/d, then dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So substituting:

Volume = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - 1/(p^2) dp )

But since we're considering magnitude, the negative sign can be ignored. So Volume = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Thus, the number of stars in this volume is N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dp) decreases as 1/p^4.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and distance, and the corresponding volume of space.

1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**: Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). A larger \( p \) corresponds to a closer star, while a smaller \( p \) corresponds to a farther star.

2. **Volume of a Spherical Shell**: The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \).

3. **Relating \( dr \) to \( dp \)**: Since \( p = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( dr \) in terms of \( dp \) as \( dr = \frac{1}{p^2} dp \).

4. **Substituting into the Volume**: Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dr = \frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the volume expression, we get:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
   \]

5. **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The number of stars per unit range of parallax (dp) is proportional to the volume, which is \( \propto \frac{1}{p^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
