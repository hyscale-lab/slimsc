Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass is moving too. So how does that affect the observed speed?

Alright, the problem states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so in glass, the speed would be 1/n normally, since speed v = c/n.

Wait, but the glass is moving, so does that add to the speed of the light? Because if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, maybe the light's speed relative to the lab would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity relative to the glass. Or is it more complicated because of relativity? Oh wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about relativistic speeds, so perhaps Newtonian mechanics apply here.

Wait, Newtonian addition of velocities. Oh right, in classical mechanics, velocities add linearly. So if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at velocity u relative to the glass, then relative to the lab, the light's speed would be u + v. But wait, u is the speed of light in the glass. So u is c/n, which in this case is 1/n. So the observed speed would be 1/n + v.

But wait, looking at the options, none of them directly match that. Let me see: The options are (1+nv)/(n+v) [A], 1 [B], etc. Hmm. So maybe that approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about this using the relativistic velocity addition formula because even if v isn't close to c, the problem expects a more accurate approach.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, the beam is in the same direction as the glass's movement, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is moving towards the observer as well. Hmm, maybe the relative velocity is a bit more involved.

Wait, let me think again. The speed of the light in the glass is 1/n. So from the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. Now, when we transform to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. Wait, actually, the glass is moving at v in the lab frame. So if the lab is observing the glass moving at v, then the light's speed in the lab frame would be according to the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no, that's getting into special relativity. But perhaps the problem expects the classical approach. Alternatively, let's think about the frame of the glass. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. The glass is moving at v in the lab frame. So from the lab frame, the light's speed would be (1/n) + v? But that's the same as what I thought before, and the options don't have that.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let's compute that when v is zero. Then it becomes 1/(n), which is correct, because when the glass isn't moving, the speed is 1/n. So that makes sense. If v is zero, the formula reduces to 1/n, which is correct. So that suggests that option A might be the right answer.

But why? How does that come about? Hmm. Let me think in terms of the velocity addition. Maybe it's not simply additive because the refractive index comes into play.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the glass is moving, so the light's speed in the lab frame is not just 1/n plus v. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, considering the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction. So perhaps from the lab frame, the light's speed is the speed of the light in the glass plus the speed of the glass, but the speed of light in the glass is (1/n). But wait, in reality, the speed of light in the glass is 1/n, but when the medium itself is moving, the observed speed is (1/n) + v, but only if the velocities are non-relativistic.

Wait, but in the lab frame, when the glass is moving at velocity v, the light's speed would be (1/n) + v, assuming that the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. But none of the options just give that. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the light's direction is towards the observer, so the glass's velocity is towards the observer. Wait, but the light's velocity in the glass is (1/n), so when the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's speed relative to the lab is (1/n) plus v. But let's see what the options give when v is small.

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v). If v is small compared to 1 and 1/n, then we can approximate. Let's do a Taylor expansion for small v: numerator is 1 + n v, denominator is n + v ≈ n (1 + v/(n)). So denominator ≈ n (1 + v/n) ≈ n (1 + (v/n)) → so denominator is n [1 + (v/n)]. So numerator is 1 + n v. So the expression becomes (1 + n v)/(n (1 + v/n)) ) → (1 + n v)/(n) * [1/(1 + v/n)].

Wait, for small v, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x. So [1/(1 + v/n)] ≈ 1 - v/n. So the expression becomes (1 + n v)/(n) * (1 - v/n) = [ (1 + n v) (1 - v/n) ] /n.

Multiply numerator: (1)(1) + (1)(-v/n) + (n v)(1) + (n v)(-v/n) → 1 - v/n + n v - v^2.

Simplify: 1 + (n v - v/n) - v². Since v is small, v² is negligible.

n v - v/n = v (n - 1/n) → which is v (n² -1)/n.

So numerator is 1 + v (n² - 1)/n.

Divide by n: [1 + v (n² -1)/n ] /n = (1/n) + v (n² -1)/n².

Which is (1/n) + v (1 - 1/n² ). So the approximation is (1/n) + v (1 - 1/n² ), which is (1/n) + v (n² -1)/(n²).

But the actual expression, if it's (1/n) + v, would have a larger term from v. So this suggests that option A isn't the same as the simple addition. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the Doppler effect for light. But the Doppler effect changes the frequency or wavelength, not the speed of light. Because the speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties and the source's speed relative to the medium, but if the medium is moving, perhaps that affects the observed speed.

Wait, another approach: the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n. But if the medium is moving with velocity u relative to the lab, then the observed speed of light in the lab would be v' = v + u, assuming that the light is moving in the same direction as u. But wait, that's the non-relativistic approach. So in that case, v' = (c/n) + u. But here, c is 1, so v' = (1/n) + v.

But looking at the options, none of them have that. So perhaps that's not the correct approach. The problem might be invoking a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because in relativity, velocities don't simply add. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But since c is 1 here, it becomes (u + v)/(1 + u v).

In this case, u is the speed of light in the glass from the glass's frame, which is 1/n. So applying the relativistic formula, the speed observed in the lab would be (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v).

But wait, let's compute that. Numerator: (1 +n v)/n. Denominator: 1 + v/n = (n + v)/n. So overall: [(1 +n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 +n v)/(n + v). Which is exactly option A.

Ah, so that makes sense. So the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, resulting in option A.

But wait, why did I think it was the relativistic formula? Because the problem is about the speed of light in a moving medium, which in relativity isn't just additive. Alternatively, the problem might be a trick question because in reality, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but in this case, the medium is moving and the light's speed isn't c because it's in a medium. Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is 1/n, regardless of the medium's motion. Or is that not the case?

Wait, no. According to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c/n in the frame of the medium. However, when the medium itself is moving, the observed speed in the lab frame would be different. But according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame would still be c, but that's only in vacuum. But here, the light is in a medium, so it's possible that the speed isn't c.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify. The problem says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." So, light is in glass, which is moving. So the question is about the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame, which is different from the speed in the glass's frame.

In the glass's frame, the light's speed is 1/n. Now, when transforming to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, the speed is calculated using the relativistic addition formula. So, the formula is (u + v) / (1 + u v) where u is the speed in the glass's frame (1/n) and v is the speed of the glass in the lab frame.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the direction. Let me make sure the velocities are correctly aligned. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab's frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, wait, no. The beam is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's movement. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, the light is moving away from the observer? No, wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So in the lab frame, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement.

So when you apply the relativistic velocity addition formula, the formula would be u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c^2). Since c=1, it's (u + v)/(1 + u v).

Here, u is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is 1/n. So u = 1/n, v is the speed of the glass in the lab frame, which is v.

So putting it all together: u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) * v )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So u' = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v) → which is option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves determining the speed of light in a glass medium relative to a laboratory frame, where the glass is moving at a constant velocity \(v\) in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as \(c = 1\), and the refractive index of the glass is \(n\). 

In the frame of the glass, the speed of light is \(u = \frac{1}{n}\). To find the speed of light in the lab frame, the relativistic velocity addition formula is applied:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Since \(c = 1\), the formula simplifies to:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + u v}
\]

Substituting \(u = \frac{1}{n}\), we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light
