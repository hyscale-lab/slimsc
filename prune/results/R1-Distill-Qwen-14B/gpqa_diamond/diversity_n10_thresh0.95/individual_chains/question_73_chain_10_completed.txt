Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think it through.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. 

Wait, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²), right? But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. Oh wait no, the formula is for when you have two velocities from different frames. So if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v in the same direction, the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Let me get this straight. If I'm in B's frame, then the speed of A would be (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Because in relativity, the relative velocity isn't just u minus v. 

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from B's frame, what's A's speed? So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c for v_rel.

Now for the total energy. Wait, the total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c². But wait, their masses are 2m and 3m, so we need to compute gamma for each and multiply by their respective masses.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy1 is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So energy2 is about 1.1547 * 3m * c² = 3.464 mc².

Adding these two together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and D has E=5 mc². So the correct energy is 5.96 mc².

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, and the total energy is around 5.96 mc². Checking the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Since both astronauts are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity of astronaut A with respect to astronaut B is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For each astronaut, we compute their energy separately and then sum the results.

1. **For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):**
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
   \]

2. **For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):**
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
   \]

Adding these energies together:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \).

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**v_rel = 0.14c, E = 5.96mc^2**
