Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a light beam moving through glass, which itself is moving at a constant velocity. The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember something about how light speed is constant in vacuum regardless of the source's motion. But wait, this is glass, not vacuum. Oh right, the glass has an index of refraction n. So in the glass, the speed of light is c/n, but that's in the rest frame of the glass, I think.

Now, but the glass is moving. So I guess I need to use some kind of velocity addition formula here. Like, maybe from special relativity? Because the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at c/n in the glass's frame. But wait, how does that work when the medium itself is moving?

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the lab frame. So in the lab, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass, so its velocity in the lab frame would be affected by the glass's motion. But light's speed in a medium isn't simply additive like in classical mechanics because of relativity.

Wait, but wait. Let me recall: in relativity, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame. But that's for objects moving at speeds much less than c, and when the observer is moving relative to the object's frame.

Wait, but in this case, the light is inside a medium (glass) that's moving. So perhaps I should consider the frame where the glass is at rest, find the light's speed there, then transform it to the lab frame.

In the glass's rest frame, the light has velocity v_light_glass = c/n. Since the glass is moving at v relative to the lab, the lab would see the light's velocity as v_light_lab.

Wait, so using the relativistic velocity addition formula. So u is the velocity of the light in the glass frame, which is c/n. The glass is moving at v in the lab frame. So the lab would see the light speed as (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²). Wait, but wait, in which direction? Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass.

Wait, no. Let me think. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass frame, the light's velocity is c/n (since it's moving through the glass). So when we transform to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, we add the velocities.

Wait, but in the glass frame, the lab is moving at -v, right? Since the glass is moving at v in the lab frame. So in the glass frame, the lab is moving towards it, but the light is moving in the same direction as the lab's motion.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify the directions. Let's say the glass is moving to the right at velocity v in the lab frame. The light is propagating to the right as well, through the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light's velocity is c/n to the right. To find the velocity in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula.

So u is the velocity of the light in the glass frame (c/n), and the velocity of the glass relative to the lab is v. The velocity of the light in the lab frame would be (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait a second. Because in the glass's frame, the speed is c/n. So u is c/n. So substituting:

v_light_lab = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v c )/(n c² ) = 1 + v/(n c ) 

So denominator is (1 + v/(n c)).

So numerator is (c + n v ) / n.

Wait, let me compute this. Let me write it step by step.

v_light_lab = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

Denominator = [ 1 + (v * c) / (n c²) ) ] = 1 + v/(n c )

So denominator = (n c + v ) / (n c )

Because 1 = (n c) / (n c), so adding v/(n c) gives [n c + v ] / (n c )

So denominator is [n c + v ] / (n c )

So v_light_lab = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Dividing by a fraction is multiplying by reciprocal:

= [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's in numerator and denominator cancel:

= [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, wait, because denominator is (n c + v ), and numerator is (c + n v ) * c.

Wait, (c + n v ) is same as (n v + c ), which is same as (n c + v ) but no, the terms are different. Wait, wait, no, I'm mixing up the terms. Let me check:

Wait, (c + n v) times c is c(c + n v) = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator is (n c + v ). So the expression is [c(c + n v)] / (n c + v).

Wait, but that doesn't look like any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) (1 + n v)/(n + v )

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Hmm. Wait, but in my calculation, I have [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v ). But c is 1 in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says c=1. So substituting c=1, the expression becomes [1*(1 + n v)] / (n*1 + v ) = (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, so that would make the answer option A. But let me think again. Because sometimes signs matter. Since the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, which is toward the observer.

Wait, in the velocity addition formula, when both velocities are in the same direction, do we add them or subtract? No, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² ), but since u and v are in same direction, it's positive.

Wait, but wait, in the problem, the glass is moving towards the observer, so the direction of v is towards the observer. The light, in the glass frame, is moving in the same direction as the beam. If the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, then the light's velocity in the glass frame is positive (same as v direction). So when adding velocities, I think the formula applies correctly.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the direction. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, which is towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the light should be moving faster than c/n, but wait, no, because c/n is in the glass frame. Wait, when the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's speed in the lab frame could be higher.

Wait, but according to our calculation, with c=1, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, another thought: the speed of light should always be less than c in any frame, right? Because even when the medium is moving, the light's speed in a medium is still c/n, but when considering the motion of the medium, the observed speed can't exceed c.

Wait, let me see: if n is 1, glass is moving at v, then the speed becomes (1 +v)/(1 +v )=1, which is c. That makes sense: for a medium with n=1 (which would be same as vacuum), the speed should remain c, regardless of medium's motion. That matches option A.

Another test case: what if v is 0? Then the speed is (1 +0)/(n +0 )=1/n, which is correct. So that seems to check out.

So the correct answer must be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and the speed of light in the glass (in its rest frame) is \( \frac{c}{n} \). The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{light, lab}} = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u \cdot v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
v_{\text{light, lab}} = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) \cdot v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) \cdot v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
v_{\text{light, lab}} = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify further:

\[
v_{\text{light, lab}} = \frac{c + n v}{n c + v}
\]

Since the problem states \( c = 1 \), substitute \( c = 1 \):

\[
v_{\text{light, lab}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Additional checks confirm the result is consistent with physical principles, such as the speed of light remaining \( c \) when \( n = 1 \) (vacuum) and reducing to \( \frac{1}{n} \) when \( v = 0 \).
