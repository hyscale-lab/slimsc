Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the actual difference, the lines would overlap, and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties. Wait, but the states themselves have their own uncertainties. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state's energy, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let's think differently. When you have two states, each with a certain uncertainty in energy, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because otherwise, the two energy levels would overlap in the uncertainty range, making them indistinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in E1 plus the uncertainty in E2. Because each state has an uncertainty in its own energy due to their lifetimes. So for E1, the uncertainty ΔE1 is ħ/(2 Δt1). Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 Δt2).

So, the minimal ΔE that allows clear distinction would be when ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Or perhaps, the minimal ΔE is when it's greater than the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. I'm a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

First, compute the energy uncertainty for each state.

For state 1: ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * Δt1)
Δt1 = 1e-9 s
So ΔE1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) ) = approx 5.25e-26 J.

Wait, but I need that in eV. Hmm. Let me convert J to eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So, 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.28e-7 eV.

Wait wait, let me do the calculation properly.

ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 5.272859e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.60217663e-19 J) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2, Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) )= 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert J to eV: 5.272859e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is approximately 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be larger than the sum of these two uncertainties, right? Because if the difference is less than the combined uncertainty, you can't distinguish the two states.

Wait, but wait. Are the uncertainties additive? Or is each state's uncertainty a separate consideration?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE must be larger than each individual uncertainty. Because if ΔE is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then E1's uncertainty is smaller than ΔE, and E2's as well. Or perhaps it's when the sum is considered.

Wait, I think the minimal condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because if the two states' energies are within each other's uncertainty, you can't resolve them.

Wait, for example, suppose E1 is at E and E2 is at E + ΔE. The uncertainty around E is ΔE1, and around E2 is ΔE2. For them to be distinguishable, the lower edge of E2's uncertainty should be above the upper edge of E1's uncertainty.

So, E + ΔE1 < (E + ΔE) - ΔE2.

Wait, that would require ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Yes, because the lower end of E2 is E + ΔE - ΔE2, and the upper end of E1 is E + ΔE1. So for these not to overlap, E + ΔE - ΔE2 > E + ΔE1 → ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So the minimal ΔE is when it's just larger than the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

So, sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is 0.001 times 1e-6. So 0.001 n eV. That's way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So it's too small.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 3.6e-7. So 1e-4 is way bigger than needed. So it's a candidate.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. 1e-8 is 0.01e-6, or 1e-8. That's about 0.03e-7, which is 0.03 x 3.6e-7 is about 1e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7. So no, D is smaller than required.

Wait, let me compute 3.6e-7 eV is 0.36e-6 eV. So the required ΔE should be larger than 0.36e-6 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 eV is 1e3 times larger than 0.36e-6. So definitely, 1e-4 eV is much larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So it's a possible candidate.

Option D is 1e-8 eV → which is 0.00000001 eV → which is 0.00001 times 0.36e-6. So way smaller than needed.

So the only option that is larger than 3.6e-7 eV is option C and maybe any larger ones. So which options have a ΔE larger?

Wait, looking at the options:

A: 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is 0.0000001 times 1e-6. So 1e-9 << 3.6e-7.

B: 1e-11 → even smaller.

C: 1e-4 → 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 1e3 times larger than 3.6e-7. So yes, it's bigger.

D: 1e-8 → 0.00000001, which is 1e-8. 3.6e-7 is 36e-8. So 1e-8 is 1/36th of that. So no.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm considering the sum of the two uncertainties, but is that the correct approach? Because each state has its own time and energy uncertainty. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of one of the states.

Wait, maybe I should think of the energy difference in terms of the measurement time. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal energy difference for the two states to be resolvable is given by the uncertainty in the energy of each state. Wait, but each state has a different lifetime, so different energy uncertainties.

Wait, another approach. For two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of either state. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty of one of them, then it's possible that the difference is within the uncertainty, making them appear as a single state.

Wait, for example, if ΔE is smaller than ΔE1, then even the lower state's uncertainty might encompass the other state. No, that's not necessarily right. Let me think: If E1 has a certain uncertainty, and E2 is just a bit higher than E1 + ΔE1, then they can be distinguished. But if E2 is within E1's uncertainty, then you can't tell.

Wait, but that depends on how the states are arranged. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then it's outside both.

Wait, but in our case, ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So the larger uncertainty is ΔE1.

So, the energy difference should be greater than ΔE1. Because if ΔE is larger than ΔE1, then even if E2 is just a little above E1 + ΔE1, it would be distinguishable.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: If E1 has ΔE1, and E2 is E1 + ΔE. The measurement of E1 could be up to E1 + ΔE1, and E2's measurement starts at E2 - ΔE2. So for them to be separate, E1 + ΔE1 < E2 - ΔE2. Rearranging, E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2 → the same as before.

So the required ΔE is greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

So, going back, the sum is approximately 3.6e-7 eV. So, the only option that's larger than this is option C, which is 1e-4 eV.

Ah, but wait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Which is much bigger than 3.6e-7 eV. So option C is definitely enough. But what about option D?

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So D is too small.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\pi},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy and \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (lifetime of the state). For distinguishability, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between the two states must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2,
\]

where \( \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_1} \) and \( \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_2} \). The lifetimes are given as \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \)
Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to eV:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Similarly, for \( \Delta E_2 \):

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to eV:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Minimum energy difference for distinguishability
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also too small.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This satisfies the condition.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
