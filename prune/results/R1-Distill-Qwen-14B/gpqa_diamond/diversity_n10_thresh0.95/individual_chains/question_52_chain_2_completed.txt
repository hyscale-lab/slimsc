--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star whose surface is partly covered by dark spots, and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The problem gives some data: the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

When looking at the photosphere, the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, so the ratio N1/N2 (neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2) decreases when spots are present. That means without spots (normal case), the ratio is higher than when there are spots.

Wait, the ratio is N1/N2. So when the star has spots, this ratio becomes lower. So the factor should be (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

But how does the temperature affect this ratio? I remember that the number of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, let me get this right. The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is proportional to exp( -(ΔE)/(kT) ), multiplied by the ratio of their degeneracies. But if the problem is giving the ratio N1/N2, then that would be the inverse of N2/N1. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (ΔE)/(kT) )

Wait, no, the formula is N_i = (g_i) * (exp( -E_i/(kT) )) * normalization. So the ratio N2/N1 is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) )

So for the same temperature, the ratio depends on g and the energy difference. But in this problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. So that should change the ratio.

But wait, spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when spots cover part of the surface, the overall observed Teff is lower. But when the spots are present, the star's photosphere as a whole is at a lower temperature. So the effective temperature of the photosphere is now 5500 K when spots are present, compared to 6000 K when they're not.

So for the star without spots, Teff is 6000 K. With spots, 5500 K. The ratio N1/N2 depends on the temperature.

Wait, but how do the spots affect the photosphere? Are the spots cooler, so the average T is lower? So the photosphere is now at a lower T when spots are present, which would change the ratio.

So the ratio of N1/N2 depends exponentially on T. Because when T goes down, the exponential term changes.

So let's model this. Let's denote the ratio as R = N1/N2. 

R = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Because N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) wait wait, no. Let me think again.

Energy levels: level 1 has E1, level 2 has E2. If E2 > E1, then ΔE = E2-E1 is positive.

So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Therefore, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So if the temperature changes, this ratio changes.

Wait, but wait. The transition corresponds to 1448 Å. So the wavelength λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is in the near UV or perhaps visible? Hmm.

But the energy difference between the levels is related to the photon energy via ΔE = hc/λ. So, ΔE = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, λ is 1448 Å.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1.448e-8 meters.

So let's compute ΔE (in Joules):

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ =1.448e-7 m (Wait, 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m. Yeah.)

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)
= (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m)
= approximately 1.372e-18 J.

But wait, that's per photon. Now, to relate to temperature, I think we can use k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38e-23 J/K).

So for a given T, k*T is the thermal energy per particle.

Let me compute for both temperatures: 6000 K and 5500 K.

At T1 =6000 K: k*T1 = 1.38e-23 *6000 ≈ 8.28e-20 J.

At T2=5500 K: k*T2 =1.38e-23 *5500 ≈7.59e-20 J.

Now, ΔE is 1.372e-18 J, which is much larger than both k*T values.

Wait, so the energy difference is about 1e-18 J, which is 1000 times bigger than k*T at both temperatures. Because 8.28e-20 J is about 0.00828e-17 J.

Wait, maybe I should compute the ratio (ΔE)/(k*T) for each T.

At T=6000 K: (1.372e-18) / (8.28e-20) = approx 16.56.

At T=5500 K: (1.372e-18)/(7.59e-20)= approx 17.99 ≈18.

So the ratio (ΔE)/(k*T) increases when T decreases, as expected.

Wait, but in the formula for N1/N2, the exponential is exp(ΔE/(k T)), which is a very large number because ΔE is much larger than k*T. Hmm, wait, but wait. No, wait. Because E is in the numerator, and T is in the denominator. Let me compute these numbers again.

Wait, 1.372e-18 J divided by 8.28e-20 J is (1.372 / 8.28) * 1e2 ≈ 0.1656 * 100 = 16.56.

Similarly, 1.372e-18 /7.59e-20 = (1.372 /7.59) * 1e2 ≈ 0.1805 * 1e2 =18.05.

So, both times, the exponent is about 16.56 and 18.05.

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Let me think about that.

Without spots (higher T), the ratio is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T1)).

With spots (lower T), R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T2)).

So the factor is R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) ].

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so the factor is exp( (ΔE/(k T1)) - (ΔE/(k T2)) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ).

Wait, yes. Because:

R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T1)] - [ΔE/(k T2)] ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So let me compute that.

Compute the exponent:

(ΔE / k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me make sure. For R1, T is T1=6000, and for R2, T is T2=5500. So:

R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k T1)) - (ΔE/(k T2)) )

Which is exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )

We can compute (1/T1 -1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = [5500 -6000]/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -500/(3.3e7) )= approximately -1.515e-5.

Wait, but then (ΔE/k) is (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.372e-18)/(1.38e-23) = approx 9.94e4 K.

So (ΔE/k) ≈ 9.94e4 K.

So the exponent is 9.94e4 K * (1.515e-5) ≈ 9.94e4 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.506 approx.

Wait, more precisely:

Compute 1/6000 = 0.000166667

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = 0.000166667 -0.000181818 = -0.0000151515 ≈ -1.51515e-5.

Multiply by (ΔE/k) which is 9.94e4 K:

9.94e4 K * (-1.51515e-5 1/K) ) ≈ 9.94e4 * (-1.51515e-5) )

= approximately -1.506.

So the exponent is approximately -1.506.

So R1/R2 = exp( -1.506 ) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, that's about 0.22, which is less than 1. So R1 is smaller than R2? No, because when the spots are present, the ratio R (N1/N2) is lower. So when spots are absent, R is higher.

Wait, let me double-check.

In the problem statement: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots (lower T), R is lower than when it doesn't (higher T). So R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (with spots).

So R1/R2 is greater than 1. But according to the calculation, R1/R2 is about 0.22, which is less than 1. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe the formula is the other way around. Let me re-examine the Boltzmann equation.

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, E2 is higher than E1, so (E2-E1) is positive. So N1/N2 is proportional to exp( positive term )

So when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, but the term (E2-E1) is fixed. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes smaller. So for a larger T, the exponent is larger, making N1/N2 larger.

Wait, but wait. If T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller. Because denominator is bigger. So for higher T, the exponent is smaller. So N1/N2 is exp( smaller number ), which is smaller than when T is lower.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me think:

Let me compute, for example, when T increases, what happens to the ratio:

Suppose E2 > E1.

At T1=6000 K:

exponent = (E2-E1)/(k T1) = positive.

At T2=5500 K: same (E2-E1)/(k T2), which is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T2). Since T2 < T1, 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1, so the exponent is larger.

Wait, wait, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger when T is smaller. So when T decreases, the exponent increases.

So for N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If T decreases, the exponent increases, so N1/N2 increases.

But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So according to this, when T decreases, N1/N2 increases. But the problem says it decreases. So this suggests that either my formula is wrong or perhaps I'm misapplying the levels.

Wait, maybe I have the levels reversed. Suppose level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. So E1 > E2. Then, E2-E1 is negative.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which level is higher. Do I know what the transition is?

The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near UV. If it's a forbidden line or something else, maybe I'm missing context. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is such that when T decreases, the ratio increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present (lower T). So perhaps the ratio N1/N2 is decreasing when T decreases, implying that for lower T, N1/N2 is lower than for higher T.

Which would mean that as T decreases, N1/N2 decreases.

So according to the formula, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So for lower T, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exponent is larger, so exp is larger. So N1/N2 increases as T decreases, which would mean when T decreases, ratio increases. But the problem says ratio decreases when T decreases.

Hmm. So perhaps I have the levels reversed. Maybe level 1 is lower than level 2. So when T decreases, the ratio N1/N2 increases, but the problem says ratio decreases. So this is a contradiction. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy levels and their probabilities. At higher temperatures, higher energy levels are more populated. So for a transition from level 1 to level 2 (assuming level 2 is higher), the number of atoms in level 2 increases with T, meaning N2 increases. So N1/N2 would decrease as T increases.

Wait, let's think: when T increases, more atoms can be excited to higher levels. So N2 increases compared to N1, so N1/N2 decreases.

If the star without spots has higher T (6000 K), then N1/N2 is lower. Wait, but the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio decreases.

Wait, when the star has spots, Teff is 5500 K, which is lower. So if the ratio N1/N2 is lower at lower T, then when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases. So the ratio is lower when the star has spots, which is exactly what the problem says. So that makes sense.

So when T is higher, the ratio N1/N2 is lower. Because more atoms are in the higher energy level (level 2), so N2 is higher, making N1/N2 smaller.

So when the star has no spots (T=6000 K), N1/N2 is lower. When the star has spots (T=5500 K), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that contradicts.

Wait, maybe I got the levels wrong. Suppose level 2 is lower in energy than level 1. So E1 > E2. Then, the energy difference is E1 - E2 = positive.

So in the Boltzmann equation, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 -E1)/(k T) ) = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait. E2 is the energy of level 2. So if E2 < E1, then (E2 - E1) is negative, so the exponent becomes (E1 - E2)/(k T) = positive.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

N2 is the number of atoms in level 2, N1 in level 1.

The energy difference is E2 - E1: if E2 > E1, then it's positive.

So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) )

So when E2 > E1, the factor is exp( negative ), so N2/N1 is less than 1, and depends on T.

Wait, but maybe I should accept that I'm getting confused and go back to the problem.

The problem states that when spots are present, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. So when T increases, the ratio increases.

Wait, that would mean that for higher T, the ratio is higher.

So N1/N2 increases with T.

Which means that N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but for E2 > E1, (E2-E1) is positive. So as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent decreases, so exp is lower. So N1/N2 is lower when T is higher.

Which contradicts the problem statement. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the transition. The transition from level 1 to level 2 emits a photon of 1448 Å. So level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2.

Thus, E2 = E1 - hc/λ.

So E1 - E2 = hc/λ.

So the energy difference is positive, and level 1 is higher.

So, in that case, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is (g2/g1) exp( - ( - (E1 - E2) )/(k T) ) = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp becomes smaller, so N1/N2 decreases.

Wait, but the problem says that when spots are present (lower T), the ratio decreases. So when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower.

But according to the formula, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

As T decreases, (E1-E2)/(k T) increases, so the exponent is more negative. So exp becomes smaller, so N1/N2 decreases.

Wait, but when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is lower? But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, N1/N2 is lower. So when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower.

But according to the formula, when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. So that matches the problem statement.

So when T is higher (no spots), N1/N2 is higher.

Wait no, wait. Let me plug in the numbers.

If T increases, (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes smaller. So the exponent -(E1-E2)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp is larger. So N1/N2 would be higher when T is higher.

Wait, no. Let me compute with T=6000 and T=5500.

E1-E2 = hc/λ = 1.372e-18 J.

At T=6000 K:

(E1-E2)/(k T) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K *6000 K) )

= 1.372e-18 / (8.28e-20) ) ≈ 16.56.

So exponent is -16.56.

exp(-16.56) is a very small number, about 8.3e-8.

At T=5500 K:

(E1-E2)/(k T) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23 *5500) = 1.372e-18 /7.59e-20 = approx 17.99.

So exponent is -17.99.

exp(-17.99) is about 1.5e-8.

So N1/N2 for T=6000 K is (g1/g2) * 8.3e-8.

For T=5500 K, it's (g1/g2) * 1.5e-8.

So when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases, which aligns with the problem statement. So when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it doesn't (T=6000 K).

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So it's R_no_spots / R_with_spots.

Which is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots = [ (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ].

The g1/g2 terms cancel, so the factor is exp( [ -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ] - [ -(E1-E2)/(k T2) ] )

= exp( (E1-E2)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, but earlier calculation had (E1-E2)/(k T1) and (E1-E2)/(k T2). So:

factor = exp( (E1-E2)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, but when I plug in the numbers, the exponents are:

At T1=6000: -(E1-E2)/(k T1) = -16.56 => exp(-16.56)=8.3e-8.

At T2=5500: -(E1-E2)/(k T2) = -17.99 => exp(-17.99)=1.5e-8.

So the factor R_no_spots/R_with_spots is (8.3e-8)/(1.5e-8) ) = approx 5.53.

Wait, that's about 5.5. But the options are 1.1,7.8,4.5,2.9.

Hmm, close to 5.5, but not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the factor using the exponent [ (E1-E2)/(k T1) - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ].

Wait, no, because factor is exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k T1) - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( (E1-E2)/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me recompute the exponent:

(E1-E2) = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)

Calculate that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ=1.448e-7 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Now, (E1-E2)/(k) = 1.372e-18 J / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= approx 99423 K ≈9.94e4 K.

So (E1-E2)/(k) ≈9.94e4 K.

Now, compute (1/T1 -1/T2 ):

1/6000 = 0.0001666667

1/5500≈0.0001818182

So 1/T1 -1/T2 ≈ (0.0001666667 - 0.0001818182) = -0.0000151515.

So (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2 ) = 9.94e4 K * (-1.51515e-5 1/K )

= 9.94e4 * (-1.51515e-5) 

= Let's compute 9.94e4 * 1.51515e-5.

9.94e4 is 99400.

1.51515e-5 is 0.0000151515.

Multiply 99400 * 0.0000151515:

99400 * 0.0000151515 = 99400 * 1.51515e-5.

Compute 99400 *1.51515e-5:

First, 1e5 is 100000.

99400 is 0.994e5.

So 0.994e5 *1.51515e-5 = 0.994 *1.51515 ≈ 1.506.

So 99400 * 1.51515e-5 = approx 1.506.

But since the product is negative, it's -1.506.

So the exponent is -1.506.

So factor is exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.221.

So the factor is approximately 0.221.

Wait, that's about 0.22. So the ratio when no spots is 0.22 times the ratio when with spots.

But the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So that's R_no_spots / R_with_spots.

Which is 0.221.

Wait, but the options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

0.22 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the ratio.

Wait, the problem says R_no_spots is higher than R_with_spots.

So when no spots, R is higher. So R_no_spots = R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) )

R_with_spots = R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T2) )

Factor = R1/R2 = exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )

Which we calculated as exp( -1.506 ) ≈0.221.

Wait, 0.221 is about 1/4.53.

Because 0.221 ≈ 1/4.53.

So 1/0.221 ≈4.53, which is option C) ~4.5.

Wait, maybe I should think about it the other way around. Because when I compute R1/R2 = 0.221, but maybe the factor is R2/R1. Because the question says "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So R_with_spots = R2 is lower than R_no_spots = R1.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2 = 0.221, which is approx 0.22. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the factor is R2/R1 = approx 4.53.

Wait, the question says, "what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots?" So when no spots, compared to when it has spots.

So factor = R_no_spots / R_with_spots.

Which is 0.221. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio N1/N2. Maybe the problem is using the reciprocal.

Wait, the problem states: when the star has spots, the ratio (N1/N2) decreases.

So when spots are present, N1/N2 is lower than when they're not.

So when no spots, R is higher. So R1 = higher, R2 = lower.

So R1/R2 = factor.

Which is 0.221, but that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the inverse. Because maybe the question is asking for R_with_spots / R_no_spots.

Which would be 1/0.221 ≈4.53, which is option C) ~4.5.

Ah, perhaps that's the case. Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is smaller. So R_with_spots = R2 = lower, R_no_spots = R1 = higher.

So the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does is R1/R2 = 0.221. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is R2/R1 = 4.53, which is option C.

But the question says, "what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots?" So if the ratio is R when no spots, and R' when with spots, the factor is R/R'.

So if R is higher than R', then factor is greater than 1.

But our calculation shows R/R' =0.221, which is less than 1. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the levels.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1. So the energy difference is E2 to E1.

Wait, the problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So it's a photon emitted when an atom drops from a higher energy level to a lower one. So E1 is lower than E2. Or E2 is lower than E1.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of 1448 Å. So E2 is the higher level.

Wait, same as before. So the formula remains the same.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, earlier I thought it's (E1-E2), but perhaps it's (E2-E1). Let me recheck.

N_i = (g_i) exp( -E_i/(k T) ) / normalization.

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because N1/N2 = [g1 exp( -E1/(kT) ) ] / [g2 exp( -E2/(kT) ) ] = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) )

So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then the exponent is positive. So higher T makes the exponent smaller, so N1/N2 decreases.

When T is higher, N1/N2 is smaller because the exponent is smaller.

So when the star has no spots, T is higher, so N1/N2 is smaller. When the star has spots, T is lower, so N1/N2 is larger.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that's not matching.

So perhaps the transition is from E1 to E2, where E2 is lower than E1. So E1 > E2.

Thus, (E2-E1) is negative, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative, and exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is exp( negative ), which is a small number. So N1/N2 is (g1/g2) multiplied by a small number.

Wait, but regardless, the problem says that when T is lower (spots present), the ratio (N1/N2) decreases. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio N2/N1, but the way it's phrased is that the ratio N1/N2 decreases.

Wait, the problem says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So it's N1/N2 that decreases when spots are present. So with spots, N1/N2 is lower.

Which implies that when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases.

Which, according to our earlier formula, would happen only if N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Which would require that E2 > E1, because then (E2-E1) is positive. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive, and when T decreases, the exponent increases, so N1/N2 increases. But this is opposite of what the problem states.

I think I'm getting stuck because I can't reconcile the formula with the problem's observation. Maybe I should think in terms of the ionization balance or other factors, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so ionization isn't the issue here. It's just the excitation between energy levels.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the exponent. Let me compute the exponent again.

(E1-E2) = hc/λ = 1.372e-18 J.

k*T for T=6000 K is 8.28e-20 J.

So (E1-E2)/(k T1) = 1.372e-18 /8.28e-20 ≈ 16.56.

Similarly, for T2=5500 K: (E1-E2)/(k T2) = 1.372e-18 /7.59e-20 ≈17.99.

So, in the formula N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, if E2 < E1, then (E2-E1) is negative, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative, and exp is a small number.

So N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * a small number.

Wait, but when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) is more negative, so exp is even smaller. So N1/N2 decreases, which aligns with the problem statement.

So when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is smaller.

So the ratio decreases when T decreases, as observed.

So when T is higher (no spots), N1/N2 is higher. So R_no_spots/R_with_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ].

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, but E2-E1 is negative. Let me compute:

(E2-E1) = - (E1-E2) = -1.372e-18 J.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = -1.372e-18 /1.38e-23 ≈ -9.94e4 K.

So the exponent becomes:

(-9.94e4 K) * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) )

= (-9.94e4) * ( -1.515e-5 )

= 9.94e4 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.506.

So the factor is exp(1.506) ≈4.5.

Which is option C) ~4.5.

Ah, I see. So I had a sign error earlier because I considered (E1-E2) instead of (E2-E1). So the correct factor is exp(1.506) ≈4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (N1/N2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Effective Temperatures**:
   - \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots),
   - \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (with spots).

2. **Energy Difference**:
   - The transition corresponds to a wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\).
   - Using \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we calculate:
     \[
     \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
     \]

3. **Factor of Change**:
   - The factor by which the ratio changes is:
     \[
     \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{with spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
     \]

### Calculation:
1. **Boltzmann Constant**:
   - \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\).

2. **Energy Difference per \(kT\)**:
   - For \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(6000)} \approx 16.56.
     \]
   - For \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(5500)} \approx 17.99.
     \]

3. **Exponent**:
   - The difference in the exponents is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right).
     \]
   - Compute \(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = -\frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
     \]
   - Compute \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
     \]
   - The exponent becomes:
     \[
     (9.94 \times 10^4)(-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.506.
     \]

4. **Factor**:
   - The factor is:
     \[
     \exp(-1.506) \approx 0.221.
     \]
   - Since the ratio decreases when the star has spots, the factor by which the ratio changes is the inverse:
     \[
     \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{with spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{0.221} \approx 4.53.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
