Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) cleavage reaction, which usually cleaves vicinal dihalides. Vicinal dihalides are compounds where two halogens are attached to adjacent carbons. When they react with HI, they undergo a cleavage to form alkenes. But wait, maybe I should think about the starting material first.

The given data is the IR and NMR of Compound X. So my first task is to determine what Compound X is. Let's analyze the IR and NMR data.

Starting with the IR data:
- The region from 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests the presence of either O-H (alcohol or carboxylic acid) or N-H (amine) stretches. But since the options include benzoic acids, maybe it's a carbonyl group. Wait, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's typical for a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions could be aromatic ring vibrations, possibly indicating substitution patterns.

Looking at the NMR:
- The 10.5 ppm peak (bs, 1H) is a broad singlet. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, likely from a carboxylic acid. Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm but as a triplet or something else, and a carboxylic acid proton is typically around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak.
- The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets with 2H each imply two sets of equivalent protons, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene. So, probably a substituent on the benzene ring that's in the para position relative to another group.
- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methine (CH) group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe part of a carbonyl group. Or perhaps a CH next to an electronegative group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): The 1.7 is a multiplet, maybe from adjacent CH2 groups, and the 1.4 d with 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something that's probably a CH (maybe a CH2 group adjacent to a branching point?), like an isopropyl group.
- The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like the end of an ethyl chain. So perhaps a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a substituted benzoic acid. The IR has a strong C=O, which could be a carboxylic acid. The NMR's 10.5 ppm is the -OH of the acid. The aromatic protons being para-substituted suggests a group attached to the benzene ring at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but the aromatic protons are two doublets. So, substituents in para positions. Let's think: for example, if the benzene has a substituent at the para position to the COOH group. So the substituent could be an ethyl group or a more complex substituent.

Looking at the NMR again, the 2.9 ppm peak (1H, m) might be a CH adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, but in a benzoic acid, the carbonyl is adjacent to an OH. Alternatively, perhaps the CH is part of a substituent attached to the benzene. For instance, if there's a substituent like CH2CH2... Hmm.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene is likely to be a chain. Let's think about the substituent. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) and 1.4 ppm (3H, d) could be a CH2CH(CH3) group. Wait, for example, an isopropyl group. Or maybe a longer chain.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (maybe for two protons adjacent to another group, like CH2), and 1.4 is a doublet for a methyl group attached to a CH. So that could be a CH2CH(CH3) group, perhaps connected to the benzene. Or wait, maybe a butyl group?

Wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), which is usually a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group. So maybe the substituent is a chain like CH2CH2CH2CH3, but attached where?

Wait, let's structure this. The substituent on the benzene is a group that has a chain leading to a methyl group. Let me try to visualize. The substituent would be something like -CH2CH2CH3, but wait, that's propyl. Alternatively, maybe a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3)2? No, maybe not. Let me think about the NMR again.

Let me list the NMR signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): -COOH OH
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons ortho to substituent
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons para to substituent
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): maybe a CH adjacent to something, like CH2CH(CH3) something
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps CH2 groups adjacent
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl attached to a CH
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group

Wait, so the substituent on the benzene is a chain that's something like CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something? Or perhaps a branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's think: if the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Let me think: the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which could be a CH2 connected to a CH group. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which is a methyl attached to a CH. The 0.9 is a triplet (3H), which is a terminal methyl in a CH2CH2CH3 chain.

So, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH? No, because the COOH is already on the benzene.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene is a group that has a chain leading to a methyl. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group? Wait, that's a pentyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, let's think of the substituent as a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? Hmm, no, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me count the protons. The CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH that is split into a multiplet. The adjacent CH2 would have the 1.7 ppm multiplet. The methyl groups would be at 1.4 and 0.9.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the structure would be benzene with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para position. So the substituent is para to the COOH.

So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is "4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid". Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, which would have a different substituent. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which doesn't have the carboxylic acid. So probably option C.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used for the cleavage of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. But if the starting compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, what would happen? Unless the starting compound is a dihalide.

Wait, maybe I got the starting compound wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, if the starting compound is a dihalide, then reacting with HI would cleave it to form an alkene. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest a dihalide. Hmm. So perhaps the starting compound has a dihalide group.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the IR. The 1720 cm-1 could be a ketone or an ester. Wait, but the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid. So perhaps 1720 is the carbonyl of the acid. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720, but the NMR would show an OCH2 or something else, but the 10.5 suggests a COOH group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde. But then the IR would have a peak around 2800 (aldehyde C-H) and a strong absorption around 1720 cm-1 (aldehyde C=O). But the NMR would show the aldehyde proton around 9.5-10 ppm, and in this case, the peak is at 10.5, which is a bit higher, more like a carboxylic acid.

So going back, I think the starting compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But then, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Wait, that's the part I'm a bit confused about. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Cleve reaction, which is used to cleave dihalides (vicinal dihalides) into alkenes, and sometimes in other cleavage reactions.

Wait, but if the starting compound is a carboxylic acid, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is an ester. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show an ester's typical OCH2 groups as a triplet or quartet.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the IR. Let me reevaluate.

The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl. It could be a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm suggests a COOH. So perhaps the IR is for a carboxylic acid.

Wait, in carboxylic acids, the C=O is around 1700 cm-1, which is close to 1720. Also, the O-H stretch in the IR is usually a broad peak around 2500-3300. The IR given shows 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, perhaps indicating O-H. So that fits a carboxylic acid.

So, the structure would be a benzoic acid with a substituent in the para position.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would be option C.

Now, the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. But wait, red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave vicinal dihalides. So, if X is a dihalide, then reacting with HI would give an alkene.

But in this case, the initial structure is a benzoic acid. So perhaps I'm getting the initial structure wrong. Maybe X isn't a carboxylic acid but something else.

Alternative approach: Perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. Let me think.

Wait, the NMR shows 10.5 ppm which is a broad peak. Let me think of other possibilities. If it's an aldehyde, the peak would be around 9-10, but perhaps a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons. Alternatively, in a hemiacetal or something else, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the 10.5 peak is not an O-H but an aldehyde proton. But then, the IR would show an aldehyde C=O around 1720, which fits. But the NMR would have a triplet or a quartet for the aldehyde proton if adjacent to another proton, but 10.5 as a broad suggests it's not an aldehyde.

Wait, another possibility: The 10.5 peak could be an -OH from an alcohol, but then the IR would show a broad peak around 2500-3400. But the IR given has that region, so maybe it's an alcohol. But the 1720 cm-1 would then need to be a ketone or ester.

But the NMR would show a triplet for the OH if it's an alcohol, but the 10.5 is a broad singlet, which is more typical for a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the IR region 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid, and the 1720 is the C=O.

So, going back, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. I'm a bit stuck because I thought that reaction is for dihalides, not for acids.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a Cleve reaction. Alternatively, another possibility is that red phosphorus and HI are used for the elimination of HX from a dihalide to form an alkene. But for that, the starting material must have a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound isn't the acid, but an ester. Let me think again.

If the starting compound is an ester, then the IR would have the 1720 cm-1 for the ester carbonyl, and maybe an O-H stretch if it's something else, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is an acid derivative.

Wait, perhaps I got the initial structure wrong. Let me try to think of another possibility.

Looking at the NMR:

- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (two doublets) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. Wait, but if the substituents are at para positions, then each substituent would cause the protons to split into two doublets. Alternatively, if there's one substituent on the ring, the others would be as well.

Wait, in the case of a mono-substituted benzene, the protons ortho and para to the substituent would have certain patterns. But here, it's two doublets each integrating for two protons, which suggests a symmetrical substitution, like two substituents in para positions or a single substituent that causes the ring to split into two sets of two equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and another group elsewhere. Hmm, but the NMR only shows two sets of aromatic protons, so perhaps the substituent is in the para position relative to another substituent. Or maybe it's a di-substituted benzene in the para positions.

Wait, but the substituent we've been considering is a sec-butyl group and the COOH in the para position.

Wait, another approach: Let's think of the substituent's structure. The substituent has a CH2 group (from the 1.7 ppm m, 2H) which is next to a CH group (2.9 ppm, m, 1H), which is next to a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d, 3H). And then a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

So, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH. Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, let's draw it out in mind. The substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3). So, that's a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3). So, the substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group, and the other substituent is a COOH group in the para position.

So, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, if this is benzoic acid, then reacting with HI may not do much. Red phosphorus is often used in the Cleve reaction, which cleaves dihalides. So perhaps the starting compound isn't a dihalide but something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is an ester. Let me think about the ester possibility.

If the compound is an ester, then the IR would have the carbonyl at ~1720. But the NMR would show an OCH2 or OCH3 group. But in the given NMR, there are no obvious oxygenated protons except the 10.5 ppm, which would be the aldehyde or COOH.

So, perhaps the initial structure is correct as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But then, what reacts with red phosphorus and HI? Another possibility: Maybe the starting compound has a bromo or chloro group adjacent to the carbonyl, which would be cleaved by HI. So, perhaps the compound is a chloro-substituted benzoic acid.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would indicate a chloro group. Chloro groups can cause splitting in adjacent protons, but there's no indication of that here.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction itself. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the Cleve reaction, which cleaves vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. So if the starting compound is a vicinal dihalide, such as 1,2-dibromo or 1,2-dichloride, then reaction with HI would eliminate HX and form an alkene.

But the initial compound must have a dihalide. So perhaps Compound X is a dihalide. Let me think again about the NMR.

Wait, if the compound is a dihalide, perhaps the aromatic ring has two halogens in the vicinal positions. But the NMR shows a para-substituted aromatic ring, so that wouldn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is on a side chain. Let me think about the substituent on the benzene.

Suppose the substituent is a chain with a vicinal dihalide. For example, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-I or CH2-CH-I-CH2... No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CHBr-CH2Br group. No, that's a geminal dihalide, which doesn't undergo Cleve reaction.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CHBr2 group. But that's a geminal dihalide, which again doesn't fit the Cleve reaction.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CHBr-Br group. But that's a vicinal dihalide on the chain.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have a CH group at 2.9 ppm, a CH2 at 1.7 ppm, and a methyl at 1.4 and 0.9 ppm. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CHBr2 group. But that would involve a dihalide in the chain.

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show any peaks that suggest the presence of Br or Cl. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. The product is an alkene. So perhaps the starting material has a dihalide, and the product is the dehalogenated alkene.

But the initial compound is a dihalide, so let's structure it.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a dihalide. For example, 4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CHBr-CH2Br group attached to the benzene ring. But again, without NMR signals indicating Br, it's hard to say.

Hmm. Perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial structure. Let me go back to the NMR.

The NMR has a 10.5 ppm (COOH), 8.0 and 7.2 (aromatic, para-substituted), 2.9 (CH), 1.7 (CH2), 1.4 (CH3), and 0.9 (CH3).

Another thought: The substituent could be a propyl group with a branch. For example, CH2CH(CH2CH3)2. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that would be a tert-butyl group, which has a single peak for the methyls.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's a neopentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2? No, that's too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group. No, that doesn't explain the NMR signals.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. Let me think in terms of the splitting.

The CH at 2.9 ppm is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm) and a CH3 (1.4 ppm). So it's like CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH? Or maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group.

Wait, another approach: The substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2 group. So, it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH2 group attached to the benzene. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, making it a pentyl group. But the N
