Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out which decay options are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Alright, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson usually involves it splitting into fermions. The Lagrangian provided is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that might be a typo in the question. Let me look again. Oh, right, the correct Lagrangian for a Yukawa interaction is usually something like L = -λ F ψ† ψ X, where F is a scalar field. Oh wait, no, maybe it's written as L = -λ ψ† ψ X if X is a scalar (boson) and ψ is the fermion field.

Wait, the given equation seems a bit off. Let me parse it again. It says, L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as L = -λ f X ψ† ψ, where f is a coupling constant. Or maybe X is a field that interacts with the fermion ψ. So in this case, the interaction term suggests that the boson X can decay into a pair of fermions ψ and their anti-particles.

So the first step is to figure out which fermions can be produced by X. The Lagrangian has the term involving ψ_f, so X can couple to any fermion ψ_f. But wait, what determines which fermions are allowed? The coupling must exist, so the Lagrangian must have a term that allows X to interact with those fermions.

But wait, in the given Lagrangian, I think it's written as something like X ψ† ψ. So the interaction term is something like X ψ ψ. So the boson X can decay into a pair of fermions ψ and ψ̄. Because the Lagrangian term is X ψ† ψ, which would allow X to produce two fermions.

So the possible decay products are pairs of fermions. Now, the next step is to consider the kinematics. The mass of X is 6 GeV. For a decay X → f f̄, the invariant mass of the fermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X. So the fermion mass must be less than half of X's mass because each fermion gets some energy and momentum, but the combined rest mass must be ≤ M_X / 2.

Wait, wait, no, that's not quite right. The condition for a particle of mass M_X to decay into two particles each of mass m is that 2m ≤ M_X. Because each fermion must have at least their rest mass. So for each fermion pair f f̄, the rest mass of the fermion must be ≤ M_X /2.

So M_X is 6 GeV. Let's compute for each fermion:

Let's list the masses of the known fermions:

Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV (so 0.0022 GeV)
Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV. So for top, 2m would be ~346 GeV, which is way larger than X's 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into top quarks.

Similarly, the tau lepton (τ) has a mass around 1.78 GeV. So 2m is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs.

For electrons (e) and muons (μ), their masses are about 0.0005 GeV and 0.1 GeV, respectively. So 2m_e is negligible, and 2m_mu is 0.2 GeV, both well below 6 GeV.

So which fermions can X decay into?

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, s, u, d, tau, e, etc.

But wait, boson X's mass is 6 GeV. Let's see each fermion's 2m.

- b quark: 4.5*2=9 GeV. 9 GeV >6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b̄.
- c quark: 1.5*2=3 GeV ≤6 GeV. So c can decay.
- s: 0.1*2=0.2 GeV → allowed.
- u: 0.0022*2 ≈ 0.0044 GeV → allowed.
- d: 0.0047*2≈0.0094 GeV → allowed.
- tau: 1.78*2=3.56 GeV ≤6 → allowed.
- e: negligible → allowed.
- mu: 0.1*2=0.2 GeV → allowed.

So the possible fermions for decay are:

c, s, u, d, tau, e, mu.

Wait, what about the bottom quark? X mass is 6 GeV, each b is 4.5 GeV. So 2m is 9 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, 9>6, so can't decay into b quarks.

So the possible decay channels are c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau taū, mu mū, e ē.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A) X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, e. Hmm, includes b which is not allowed. So A is out.

Option B) X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e. So all allowed. So B includes c, which is allowed, but does the coupling exist for all these fermions?

Wait, but the question is about the interaction given by the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian term is -λ f ψ_f(y)(ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps I misread the Lagrangian. Let me look again.

The user wrote:

\mathcal{L}\left(y\right)=-\lambda{f}\bar{\psi}{f}\left(y\right)\left(\upsilon+X\left(y\right)\right)\psi_{f}\left(y\right)

Hmm, maybe the correct Lagrangian is for a Yukawa interaction. The standard Yukawa Lagrangian is L = -g \phi \bar{\psi} \psi, where phi is the scalar field, ψ is the fermion, and g is the coupling.

So in this case, the boson is X, and the coupling is to fermions ψ_f. So the interaction is between X and ψ_f. So X can decay into any ψ_f and ψ_f̄, provided that the coupling is present.

But the question is about which of these fermions are kinematically allowed, given X's mass.

So, the fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 2m ≤6 GeV). Let's check each:

c quark: 1.5 GeV → allowed.

s quark: 0.1 GeV → allowed.

u quark: 0.0022 GeV → allowed.

d quark: 0.0047 GeV → allowed.

tau: 1.78 GeV → allowed.

mu: 0.1 GeV → allowed.

e: 0.0005 GeV → allowed.

b quark: 4.5 GeV → 2m=9 GeV >6 → not allowed.

t quark: 173 GeV → way too heavy.

So the allowed fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So the decay channels are X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau taū, mu mū, e ē.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So B is X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau taū, mu mū, e ē. So that's allowed.

Option C: includes t quark, which is not allowed because 2m_t is way above 6 GeV. So C is out.

Option D: has b quark, which is too heavy, so D is out.

Option A: includes b quark, which is too heavy. So A is incorrect.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B) X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau taū, mu mū, e ē.

Yes, that's all allowed.

But wait, does the interaction term include all these fermions? The Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe the ψ_f is a specific fermion. Maybe the problem is that the Lagrangian is written in a way that indicates it's for each fermion separately. So each ψ_f is a specific fermion, not a sum. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the Lagrangian is written as L = -λ (ῡ + X) ψ_f ψ_f. No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct Lagrangian is L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f. Oh, I think I get it now. The interaction is such that X couples to each fermion ψ_f. So the X can decay into any ψ_f and ψ_f̄, provided that the coupling exists and the kinematics allow it.

So, the possible decay channels are any fermion pair where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. From earlier, that includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So the decay options allowed are c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau taū, mu mū, e ē.

Looking again at the options:

Option B includes all of these except top quark, which isn't present. So B is the correct choice.

Wait, let me double-check the options:

Option B) X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's B.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \), allowing \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs \( f \bar{f} \). The kinematic constraint for such decays is that the total rest mass of the decay products must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Analyze the fermion masses
The rest masses of the relevant fermions are approximately:
- \( u \): \( 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( d \): \( 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( s \): \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( c \): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( e \): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- \( u \), \( d \), \( s \), \( c \), \( \tau \), \( \mu \), and \( e \).

The \( b \)-quark (\( m_b = 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)) and \( t \)-quark (\( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) are excluded because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 2: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden. **Rejected**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Accepted**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is kinematically forbidden. **Rejected**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden. **Rejected**.

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) are \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
