Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is when all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I guess I have to consider how that changes.

First, let me recall the basics. In the classical case, the potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the maximum kinetic energy is the same, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that would give v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which looks like option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so that can't be the right answer. Relativity probably complicates things because at high speeds, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

In special relativity, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, how does that apply here? The oscillator's potential energy and kinetic energy probably are treated differently in relativity.

So the system is a harmonic oscillator, obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. The potential energy would still be (1/2)kx². But the kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma -1)mc². So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum speed (and hence maximum kinetic energy), the potential energy is zero, but wait, no. Wait, when the mass is at maximum displacement, x=A, potential energy is maximum, and kinetic energy is zero. But as it moves through the equilibrium point, x=0, the potential energy is zero, and kinetic energy is maximum. So, in the non-relativistic case, that's when KE is max. But in relativity, maybe the energy is conserved, so total energy (including rest mass) is conserved.

Wait, but in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential as in the classical case. Or maybe it is, but we have to account for relativistic effects on the kinetic part.

So, the total energy E of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, plus the potential energy. But wait, in relativity, the potential energy is considered part of the total energy, so the total energy E would be:

E = gamma * mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but actually, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of KE and PE. In relativity, perhaps the total energy is different. Hmm, maybe I should think about energy conservation.

At the point of maximum displacement, x=A, the velocity is zero. So kinetic energy (relativistic) is (gamma-1)mc², but at that point, gamma is 1 because v=0. So KE is zero. But wait, that can't be right because if the mass is moving, the energy must come from somewhere.

Wait, maybe the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is that plus the rest mass energy. So when the mass is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum, which would be E = gamma mc². But wait, E must be equal to the sum of rest energy and kinetic, so E = gamma mc^2 = (1/2)kA^2 + mc^2. Wait, if that's the case, then:

gamma mc^2 = (1/2 k A^2) + mc^2.

Subtract mc^2 from both sides: (gamma -1) mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So:

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2)/(c^2)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c^2) as some term, say alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) = 1 + alpha.

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, let me compute the right side:

1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2] = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So numerator is 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

Denominator is (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Take alpha as (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), which is small if kA is not too large compared to mc². But let's see.

So,

v_max^2 = c² * [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute that.

So,

v_max^2 = c² * [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator terms:

2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) = (k A^2) / (m c^2).

And the square term is (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4).

So numerator becomes:

[k A^2/(m c^2)] + [k² A^4/(4 m^2 c^4)].

Denominator is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Wait, denominator is (1 + alpha)^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2? Wait, no. 1 + alpha is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ), so denominator is ( (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) )^2.

So denominator is ( (2 m c² + k A²) )² / (4 m² c^4) )^2.

Wait, perhaps I should factor this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out (1/(m c^2)) from numerator and denominator. Let me see.

Wait, maybe this is getting too messy. Let me try to see if any of the options match the expression I have.

Wait, the options given are:

A) v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m)))^2 )

Hmm, that denominator looks like (1 - (k A²/(2m)) ), which is different from what I have.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c² )) )) 

Wait, that's 1 + [ 1/(1 - beta) ] where beta is (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Option D: c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Wait, let me compute what I have for v_max.

From earlier, I have:

v_max^2 = c² * [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ] / (1 + alpha)^2, where alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

Numerator: 2 alpha + alpha^2 = alpha (2 + alpha).

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, another approach: Let me note that 2 alpha + alpha^2 = alpha (2 + alpha) and denominator is (1+alpha)^2.

So,

sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

= sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm, this doesn't seem to directly match any of the options.

Wait, let me think again about the expression I had for gamma.

Earlier, I had gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2 )

= [ 2 m c² + k A^2 ] / (2 m c² )

Then, 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = [2 m c² + k A^2]/(2 m c^2 )

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 2 m c^2 / (2 m c² + k A^2 )

Then,

1 - v²/c² = [ 4 m² c^4 ] / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2

= [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 - 4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Expanding the numerator:

(2 m c²)^2 + 2*(2 m c^2)(k A²) + (k A²)^2 - 4 m² c^4.

= 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 - 4 m² c^4.

Simplify:

4 m² c^4 cancel out with -4 m² c^4. So,

= 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4.

Factor this:

k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Wait, that's not right. Wait, 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 = k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

So,

v²/c² = [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, so,

v = c * sqrt( [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] ) / (2 m c² + k A^2 )

= c * [ A sqrt(k (4 m c² + k A² )) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )

Wait, but this doesn't seem to match any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should instead express this in terms of gamma. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-examine the energy.

In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy should be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, but also considering the potential energy.

Wait, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of KE and PE. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)k A².

So, the total energy is:

E = (gamma - 1) mc² + (1/2)k A².

But the total energy should also be equal to the rest energy plus any other energy, right? Or wait, maybe in a relativistic oscillator, the energy is (gamma) mc² + (1/2)k x²? No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is (gamma) mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)k A². So, at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so KE is zero. Then, the total energy E would be (gamma) mc² = (1/2)k A².

Wait, no, that can't be right because gamma would then be (1/2 k A²)/(mc²). But in that case, when the mass is at x=0, all energy is KE, so E = (gamma') mc², where gamma' is the gamma at maximum speed. So, (gamma') mc² = (1/2) k A^2.

But earlier when x=A, the mass has zero velocity, so the KE is zero, and the total energy is (1) mc² + (1/2)k A².

Hmm, maybe that's the correct way to set it up.

Wait, wait, perhaps the rest energy is mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)k x². So, the total energy E is:

E = mc² + (1/2)k x².

Wait, but then when the mass is at x=0, E = mc² + 0 = mc². When it's at x=A, E = mc² + (1/2)k A². But that can't be, because in the classical case, the energy is conserved as (1/2)k A², which is the sum of KE and PE.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing concepts. Maybe in the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)k x². Or perhaps the approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc², so the total energy is:

E = (gamma -1) mc² + (1/2)k x².

But then, at x=0, the PE is zero, so E = (gamma -1) mc².

At x = A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1 (since v=0), so E = 0 + (1/2)k A². So,

E = (1/2)k A².

But also, at x=0,

E = (gamma_max -1) mc²,

where gamma_max is the gamma when v is maximum.

So,

( gamma_max -1 ) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma_max = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / ( 2 m c² )

So,

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c² )

Which is the same as I had before.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is same as Equation (1).

Then, solving for v_max^2:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(gamma_max)^2 ]

Wait, because 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = gamma, so sqrt(1 - v²/c^2) = 1/gamma.

So,

1 - v²/c^2 = 1/gamma_max^2.

Thus,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma_max^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_max^2 )

Now, substituting gamma_max:

gamma_max = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

gamma_max^2 = [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So,

1/gamma_max^2 = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ]^2.

Therefore,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))]^2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 )

Yes! That's exactly what I have here. So, the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the options.

Option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 )

Yes, that's the same as what I derived.

So, the answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy. 

At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and the total energy is purely potential: 

\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is purely kinetic. In special relativity, the kinetic energy is given by \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2.
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:

\[
\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy conservation and the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

**Answer: D**
