Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about metrics in general relativity and differential geometry.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that the area of a surface in 2D can be found using the metric. The formula for the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric here is in terms of dx² + dy² multiplied by a factor. So it's diagonal, and the off-diagonal terms are zero. That means the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 -x² -y²) and g_yy = same as g_xx, and g_xy and g_yx are zero.

So the determinant of the metric tensor, g, would just be (g_xx)*(g_yy) - 0 = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². But wait, no, because the determinant for a diagonal metric is just (g_xx * g_yy). So sqrt(g) would be sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) = [32/(4 - x² - y²)].

Wait, no, sqrt(g) is sqrt(g_xx * g_yy), which is sqrt( [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² ), which is 32/(4 -x² - y²). So the area element is that times dx dy.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. Alternatively, maybe this metric represents a pseudosphere of a certain radius.

Wait, the metric looks like it's in 2D. So maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in a higher dimension, but for this problem, it's a 2D metric, and we're to find its area.

Wait, but the options are given in terms of x and y, which seems odd because area should be a number, not a function of x and y. Hmm, that's confusing. Or perhaps the question refers to the total area, but maybe the metric covers only a part of the pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps the radius is 2 as in the Gaussian curvature. I remember that for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative and is related to the radius. Let me think: for a sphere of radius r, the curvature is 1/r². For a pseudosphere, it's -1/a² where a is the radius. So if the radius is 2, the curvature would be -1/(2)^2 = -1/4.

But how does that relate to the given metric? Let me see. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 -x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me try to compare this to the standard metric for a pseudosphere or a surface of constant curvature.

I think the metric for a space of constant curvature in 2D can be written in terms of a parameter. For example, for Euclidean space, it's just flat, but for hyperbolic space, it's ds² = dr² + (1 - k r²)^2 / (1 - k r²) ) dθ², but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, in isothermal coordinates, the metric can look like something similar.

Wait, another approach: the metric given is conformally flat, meaning it's just a scaling of the flat metric. The conformal factor here is [32/(4 -x² - y²)].

Wait, for a metric of constant curvature, the conformal factor would relate to the curvature. For a hyperbolic surface, like a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative. The standard metric in isothermal coordinates for constant curvature is something like ds² = (2/(sqrt(-k)) * (d x² + d y²)), where k is the curvature. But I'm not certain about the exact form.

Alternatively, I remember that in 2D, the area of a surface with constant curvature K is 4π / |K| for a sphere. But wait, that's when the surface is a complete sphere. For a pseudosphere, which is a surface with infinite extent, the area would be infinite. But wait, in this question, the options include D) +infty, so that's a possibility.

Wait, but the given metric has a denominator 4 -x² - y². So the region where this is defined is 4 -x² - y² >0, meaning x² + y² <4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So this metric is defined only within that disk. So the area would be the integral over x and y, with x² + y² <4, of the area element.

So the area would be ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, integrated over x² + y² <4.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me perform a change of variables to polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The integral becomes ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the integral over θ would just contribute a factor of 2π. So the area is 2π * ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r², so du/dr = -2r, so -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [32 * (-du/2) / u]. The limits change from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0). So:

-32/2 ∫ (from 4 to 0) (du/u) ) = (-16) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but when u approaches 0, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So this integral would diverge to positive infinity. Because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand blows up.

So the area would be infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but this metric is only defined for r <2, so the area is finite within that radius? No, because the integrand behaves like 1/(4 - r²) near r=2, which is 1/( (2 - r)(2 + r) ) ≈ 1/(4 - r²) ≈ 1/(2² - r²) )= 1/(4 - r²). So as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integral ∫ r dr/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2 would be integrating from 0 to 2, and the numerator r dr is approaching 2 dr, so the integrand is roughly 2/(4 - r²), which goes to infinity as r approaches 2.

So the integral becomes a divergent integral, which means the area is infinite. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. If the pseudosphere's area is finite or not. Wait, the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface of infinite extent but finite area. Wait, no, isn't the tractricoid, or the pseudosphere, a surface with finite area? Because it's a surface of revolution of a tractrix, and the area is 4π a², where a is the parameter. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. The tractrix has a certain property, but the pseudosphere is a model of hyperbolic geometry and has infinite area? Or am I mixing things up?

Alternatively, in the metric given, as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, which would imply that the area is infinite. So the area element diverges, making the total area infinite.

So the answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is a conformally flat metric in 2D. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we use the area element in conformal coordinates:

\[
\text{Area element} = \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The metric is defined for \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This is a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. To compute the total area, we integrate the area element over this region:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where we have switched to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \). The integral over \( \theta \) contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), leaving:

\[
\text{Area} = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). Changing the limits accordingly (\( r = 0 \to u = 4 \), \( r = 2 \to u = 0 \)), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \ln(u) \Big|_0^4.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln(u) \to -\infty \), causing the integral to diverge. This indicates that the area is infinite. Therefore, the total area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.

Answer: D
