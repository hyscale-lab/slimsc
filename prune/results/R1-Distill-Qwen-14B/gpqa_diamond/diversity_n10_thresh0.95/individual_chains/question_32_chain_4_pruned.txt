Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking me to find the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I remember that Li usually has 3 protons. So, if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons.

Wait, so I need to find the energy of the ion in the collider. I think this is related to relativistic energy because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c is pretty fast). Relativistic effects are definitely important here.

So, the basic formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 - (v^2)/(c^2)). Right, because gamma accounts for the time dilation and other effects when moving at high speeds.

First, I'll calculate gamma. The speed v is 0.96c. So v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Subtract that from 1, which gives 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Taking the square root of that: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Then gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Next, I need the mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so I should find its mass. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass of the electron (since Li has 3 electrons, but in the nucleus, the electrons aren't part of it). Wait, no. Actually, the mass of the nucleus is the total mass of protons and neutrons minus the mass lost due to binding energy (mass defect). But for a rough calculation, maybe we can approximate using the average mass of a nucleon.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to look up the exact mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron, approximately 939 MeV/c². Let me confirm: protons are about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutrons about 939.565 MeV/c². So, the mass of Li-6 is 3 protons +3 neutrons.

So, 3 * (938.272) + 3 * (939.565) = let's compute that. 

3*938.272 = 2814.816 MeV. 
3*939.565 = 2818.695 MeV. 
Adding together: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. 

Wait, but that's the total mass of the individual nucleons. But the actual mass of the nucleus is less because of the mass defect. Hmm, this complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of the constituent protons and neutrons without considering the binding energy. Or perhaps, since the question is about the kinetic energy, maybe we're supposed to calculate the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic) or just the kinetic energy?

Wait, the formula for relativistic energy includes the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0 c², where m0 is the rest mass of the nucleus. So I need the rest mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ion as a single particle with a certain mass, and we have to find its total energy, which includes the rest mass energy multiplied by gamma.

But wait, the options are given in GeV. So I need to compute the total energy in GeV.

Alternatively, I recall that the rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 * (mass of a nucleon) minus the binding energy. But I don't remember the exact value. Maybe I can get the exact mass from the periodic table.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.0151 * 931.5 ≈ 14.03 MeV. So total is 5589 +14.03 = 5603.03 MeV, which is about 5.603 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 6.0151 u converted to MeV is 6.0151 * 931.5 ≈ 5603 MeV, which is 5.603 GeV. So m0 c² is 5.603 GeV.

Wait, that makes sense because each nucleon is about 1 GeV, so 6 would be about 6 GeV. But due to binding energy, it's a bit less.

So, m0 c² is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Then, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m0 c². Gamma is 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3.5714 * 5.603 ≈ ?

Let me compute step by step.

3 * 5.603 = 16.809.

0.5714 *5.603: let's compute 0.5 *5.603=2.8015, 0.0714*5.603≈0.4015. So total 2.8015 +0.4015=3.203.

So total E ≈ 16.809 +3.203 = 20.012 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but my approximation might be a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should do a more precise calculation.

Let me calculate gamma more accurately. v =0.96c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)

(0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 -0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/(0.28) = 3.57142857...

So more accurately, gamma is approximately 3.57142857.

Now, m0 c^2 is 5.603 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me multiply these numbers precisely.

5.603 * 3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

5.603 * 3 = 16.809

5.603 * 0.5 = 2.8015

5.603 * 0.07142857 ≈ let's calculate.

0.07142857 is 1/14.

So 5.603 /14 ≈ 0.400214.

Adding all parts: 16.809 + 2.8015 = 19.6105; plus 0.400214 gives 20.0107 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0107 GeV, which is approximately 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm. My calculation is giving about 20.01 GeV, but none of the options exactly match. Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, maybe the mass I used was incorrect. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6. I think the exact rest mass is important here.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151215 u. So
