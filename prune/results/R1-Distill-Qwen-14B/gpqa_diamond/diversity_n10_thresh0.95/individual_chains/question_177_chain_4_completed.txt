--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the problem is about luminosities. Oh right, the question is asking about the ratio of their luminosities.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength. That's probably from Wien's Law, which relates the peak wavelength of a black body's emission to its temperature. Wien's Law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So if the peak wavelengths are the same, that means their temperatures are the same. Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2. That's useful.

Next, the problem says they calculated radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, how does radial velocity affect luminosity? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a red herring? Because luminosity is about the intrinsic brightness, not how it's moving. Unless... wait, the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength via the Doppler effect. But wait, the peak wavelengths they determined are the same, so maybe the Doppler shift is factored into that.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us (or away?), would that shift the observed peak wavelength? Oh right, if Star_2 is moving away (positive radial velocity), it would cause a redshift, making the observed wavelength longer. But in the question, the peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift has been accounted for, or the velocities are such that the observed peak wavelength is same. But I'm not sure how that plays in. Maybe the velocities are given for another purpose, like calculating other parameters, but maybe not directly here.

Wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So, we can use the black body luminosity formula, which is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both are black bodies, we can model them that way. So, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Because the 4πσ terms cancel out when taking the ratio.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2. From the problem, R1 = 1.5 R2.

And earlier, from the peak wavelengths being the same, T1 = T2. Because lambda_max is same, so T is same. So T1 = T2.

So substituting into the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T^4 ) )

The T^4 terms cancel since T1 = T2. So:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 R2^2 ) / R2^2 )

Which simplifies to (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25.

Wait, but wait a minute. Are the temperatures really the same? Because the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same, but I should make sure that the observed peak wavelength is the same, which might involve Doppler shifts. Because if Star_2 is moving, its emitted peak wavelength would be different, and then we observe a shifted wavelength.

Wait, so the problem states: through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is same. Oh, but the actual emitted lambda_max could be different due to their velocities. So we need to account for that.

Oh right, because Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. So the emitted lambda_max for each star is lambda_emit = lambda_observed * sqrt( (1 + v)/ (1 - v) ) ) or something like that, but maybe it's more accurate to use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Wait, but the velocities given are 0 and 700 km/s. Star_1 has velocity 0, so its observed lambda_max is the same as its emitted. Star_2 has velocity 700, so its observed lambda_max is Doppler shifted. But the problem says that the observed lambda_max is same for both. So that would imply that their emitted lambda_max are different.

Wait, wait, let me think. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us (if velocity is positive when moving away?), then the observed wavelength would be shorter than emitted. Or perhaps negative velocity is towards us, positive away.

Wait, the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s for Star_2. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that could mean it's moving away from us. So its light would be redshifted. So the observed lambda_max would be longer than the emitted. But the problem states that the observed lambda_max is same as Star_1, which has zero velocity.

So Star_1's observed lambda_max is equal to its emitted lambda_max (since v=0). So Star_2's observed lambda_max is also the same as Star_1's. So Star_2's emitted lambda_max must be shorter (since it's moving away, so light is redshifted). So what's the relation between their emitted lambda_max?

Wait, let me get this right. Let me set up the Doppler shift formula. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, but velocities are given in km/s. Let's compute v/c for Star_2. 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 700e3 / 3e8 = approx 0.002333... So v/c is about 0.00233, which is small. So we can approximate the Doppler shift using the Taylor expansion for small v.

So Doppler shift formula can be approximated as:

lambda_observed ≈ lambda_emitted (1 + v/c )

Wait, but I need to be careful with the direction. If Star_2 is moving away (v positive), then the observed wavelength is longer. So the observed lambda is lambda_emit * (1 + v/c). Hmm, but wait, I think the exact formula is:

lambda_obs / lambda_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Which for small v can be approximated as 1 + v/c. Because when v is small, sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ≈ 1 + x, where x = v/c.

Wait, let me check. Let me let x be v/c, which is 700e3 / 3e8 → 0.002333.

So (1 + x) / (1 - x) ≈ (1 + x) (1 + x) ) for small x. So sqrt of that is 1 + x. So lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit (1 + x).

So for Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c )

But lambda_obs for Star_2 is same as lambda_obs for Star_1. So lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c ) = lambda_emit1.

Because Star_1 has v=0, so lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

Thus, lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 / (1 + v2/c )

But from before, we know that the emitted lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So lambda_emit1 = b / T1, lambda_emit2 = b / T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that T1 and T2 are the same because the observed lambda_max are the same. But that was before considering the Doppler shift. So I think I made a mistake in the initial approach.

So let me redo this part.

The observed lambda_max is same for both stars. So:

lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

But for Star_1, lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1, since v1=0.

For Star_2, lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c ), because v2 is positive (moving away), leading to redshift.

So lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c )

But lambda_emit is related to temperature by lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c )

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )^{-1}

Hmm, so T2 is lower than T1. Because (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, so T2 is T1 divided by that.

Alternatively, T2 = T1 / (1 + v2/c )

But v2 is 700e3 m/s, c is 3e8 m/s. So v2/c is 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.002333.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T2 ≈ T1 / 1.002333 ≈ T1 * (1 - 0.00233 )

Wait, because 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So, T2 ≈ T1 ( 1 - 0.00233 )

So T2 ≈ 0.99767 T1.

So now, let's get back to the luminosity. The luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So the ratio L1/L2 is [ (R1² T1⁴) ] / [ (R2² T2⁴) ]

We have R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Simplify R terms:

(1.5^2 R2^2 ) / R2^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25.

Now, the T terms: (T1 / T2 )^4.

We have T2 ≈ T1 * (1 - v2/c ) ≈ 0.99767 T1.

So T1 / T2 ≈ 1 / 0.99767 ≈ 1.00234.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.00234)^4.

Let me compute that. 1.00234^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute ln(1.00234) ≈ 0.002337 (since ln(1+x) ≈x for small x).

So 4 * ln(1.00234) ≈ 0.009348. Exponentiating, e^0.009348 ≈ 1.0094.

So (1.00234)^4 ≈ approx 1.0094.

So the T ratio term is about 1.0094.

So the total L1/L2 ratio is 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.2719.

Wait, but that's about 2.27. Looking at the options, option B is ~2.32, option C is ~2.35, option D is ~2.23. Hmm, but none of them exactly match 2.27. But perhaps I made an approximation that needs to be more precise.

Wait, because I approximated 1/(1 + v/c) as 1 - v/c. Let me compute it more accurately.

v2/c = 700,000 m/s / 3e8 m/s = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.0233333... Wait wait, wait, 700,000 is 7e5, 3e8 is 300 million. 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.0233333333.

Wait! Oh no, I messed up earlier. Wait, 700,000 divided by 3e8 is 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) = 0.00233333... Oh wait, no. Wait, 700,000 is 7e5. 3e8 is 300 million. 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) = 7/(3000) ≈ 0.00233333. So yes, earlier calculation was correct, 0.23333% of c.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the Doppler shift. Because when the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so (1 + v/c) is the factor. So the Doppler formula is: lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c), when v is positive for moving away.

So for Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c )

But Star 1's lambda_obs = lambda_emit1.

And they're the same, so lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c )

But lambda_emit is inversely proportional to T: lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )^{-1}

Which is T2 = T1 / (1 + v2/c )

Since v2/c is 0.00233333,

(1 + v2/c ) = 1.00233333.

So,

T2 = T1 / 1.00233333 ≈ T1 * (1 - 0.00233333 )

Because, using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So,

T2 ≈ T1 * 0.99766667.

So,

T1 / T2 ≈ 1 / 0.99766667 ≈ 1.002345.

So (T1 / T2 )^4 = (1.002345)^4.

Let me compute that accurately.

Let me compute x = 0.002345.

So,

(1+x)^4 = 1 +4x +6x² +4x³ +x^4.

x = 0.002345.

Compute each term:

4x = 0.00938.

6x² = 6*(0.002345)^2 = 6*(5.5e-6) ) = 3.3e-5 ≈ 0.000033.

4x^3 =4*(0.002345)^3 =4*(1.3e-8) )≈ 5.2e-8 ≈ 0.000000052.

x^4 = (0.002345)^4 ≈ 3e-11, which is negligible.

So,

1 + 0.00938 + 0.000033 + 0.000000052 ≈ 1.009413.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.009413.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.009413 = 2.25 * 1.009413 ≈ 2.271.

So about 2.27.

Looking at the options: option B is ~2.32, option C ~2.35, option D ~2.23, option A is ~2.25.

Hmm, 2.27 is closer to 2.25 (option A) but perhaps my approximation is a bit rough.

Wait, maybe I need to compute (1.002345)^4 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the more precise formula for Doppler shift without the approximation.

Wait, another approach: calculate the exact value of (1.00233333)^4.

Wait, 1.00233333 is 1 + 0.00233333.

So,

(1.00233333)^4 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

First, compute (1.00233333)^2:

(1.00233333)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.00233333) + (0.00233333)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.00466666 + about 5.44e-6.

So that's approximately 1.00466666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.0046721.

Now, square that result to get to the fourth power.

(1.0046721)^2 = ?

Compute 1.0046721 * 1.0046721:

= 1 + 2*(0.0046721) + (0.0046721)^2.

= 1 + 0.0093442 + (approx 0.0000218).

So that's about 1.0093442 + 0.0000218 = 1.009366.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.009366.

So L1/L2 is 2.25 * 1.009366 ≈ 2.25 * 1.009366.

Compute 2.25 * 1.009366.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.009366 ≈ 0.0210735.

So total ≈ 2.25 + 0.0210735 ≈ 2.27107.

So about 2.271.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B) ~2.32, but 2.27 is closer to option D) ~2.23 or option A) ~2.25.

Wait, but 2.27 is between A and D. Let's think about possible errors.

Wait, perhaps I got the Doppler formula wrong, which could change the T ratio.

Wait, another thought: when the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the star emits at a shorter wavelength. So for Star_2, lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c), as I did earlier.

Another possibility is that the effective temperature affects the luminosity, but I think I accounted for that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the Doppler shift because it's stated that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, which already factors in any Doppler shifts. So in that case, the initial approach without considering Doppler (i.e., T1=T2) would have given L1/L2=2.25 (option A). But then why are the velocities given? That suggests the velocities do play a role.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rest frame of the stars, and the fact that the observed peak is same implies that T1 and T2 are different, as I did earlier.

Hmm, but without considering the Doppler shift, the answer would be 2.25, which is option A. But when considering the Doppler, it's about 2.27, which isn't exactly one of the options. But perhaps the calculation expects us to ignore the Doppler shift.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"Astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."

So the stars appeared brightest at the same wavelength, which is the observed wavelength. So the Doppler shift must have been accounted for, so the temperatures are not the same. So in that case, the initial approach without considering Doppler is incorrect.

So the correct ratio is approximately 2.27, which isn't exactly an option. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to 2.25, but that would be option A.

Hmm, but that's confusing because the velocities are given, which implies they should be considered.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: maybe the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but not the intrinsic parameters. Hmm, but no, the question says the stars radiate as black bodies, so their temperatures are adjusted based on their velocities when calculating the observed emission.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the temperatures more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the stars' temperatures are the same because their observed peak wavelengths are the same, ignoring the Doppler effect. Maybe the velocities are a distractor.

In that case, L1/L2 would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But the problem gives the velocities, so probably it's intended to factor them in.

Wait, let's think again. The problem says the stars are observed to have the same peak wavelength, so their observed lambda_max is same. So the Doppler shift must adjust their emitted lambda_max to same observed.

So, for Star_2, lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c )

And for Star_1, lambda_emit1 = lambda_obs.

So, lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v/c )

But lambda_emit is inversely proportional to temperature.

So,

lambda_emit1 = b / T1

lambda_emit2 = b / T2

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c )

→ T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

Wait, wait a second, no: Wait, lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v/c )

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2 ) (1 + v/c )

→ 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v/c )

→ T2 = T1 / (1 + v/c )

Ah, same as before.

So,

T2 = T1 / (1 + v/c )

So,

T1 = T2 * (1 + v/c )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 + v/c = 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

So,

(T1 / T2 )^4 = (1.002333)^4 ≈ ?

Wait, 1.002333^4. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute (1.002333)^4:

Compute step by step:

(1.002333)^2 = (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 + 5.44e-6 ≈ 1.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

Then, square that:

(1.00467144)^2 = ?

= 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2.

= 1 + 0.00934288 + ~ 2.18e-5.

= 1.00934288 + 0.0000218 ≈ 1.00936468.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = 1.00936468.

Thus, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.00936468 = 2.25 * 1.00936468 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00936468.

Let me calculate 2.25 * 1.00936468.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00936468 = approximately 0.021073.

So total is 2.25 + 0.021073 = 2.271073.

So approximately 2.27.

Now, look at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

2.27 is between options A and B, closer to A but not exact. So why is this not matching any of the options?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to 2.25. Then the answer would be A.

But the problem gives the velocities, so perhaps it's intended to consider it, making the luminosity ratio about 2.27, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation. Let me think again. For small velocities, the Doppler shift can be approximated as:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c )

But since Star_2 is moving away, v is positive. So, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So, lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c )

Which would mean T2 = b / lambda_emit2 = b (1 + v/c ) / lambda_obs.

Similarly, T1 = b / lambda_emit1 = b / lambda_obs.

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

Wait, no, because T2 = (b / lambda_emit2 ) = (b * (1 + v/c )) / lambda_obs = (1 + v/c ) * (b / lambda_obs ) = (1 + v/c ) * T1.

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

Which implies that T2 is larger than T1.

Wait, that's conflicting with earlier calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me think again.

If a star is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed wavelength is longer. Hence, the emitted wavelength is shorter than observed. So lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c )

But lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

lambda_emit2 = b / T2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c )

So,

T2 = b (1 + v/c ) / lambda_obs.

Similarly, T1 = b / lambda_obs.

Therefore, T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

Ah, so T2 is greater than T1? That can't be right because if Star_2 is moving away, it's emitting at a shorter wavelength (hence higher temperature) than Star_1, which has same observed wavelength.

Wait, but Star_1 has same observed wavelength as Star_2. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength is shorter (higher T). So T2 is higher than T1?

But that would imply that L2 would be higher, but in the problem, Star_1 has larger radius and mass. Hmm, perhaps this is correct.

Wait, let me recalculate the temperature ratios correctly.

lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1 (since v1=0 )

lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 (1 + v2/c )

Set lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2:

lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 (1 + v2/c )

But,

lambda_emit1 = b / T1

lambda_emit2 = b / T2

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) (1 + v2/c )

→ 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c )

→ T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

So T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So earlier I thought T2 was lower, but now T2 is higher.

So that must have been the mistake. So earlier when I thought that Star_2's emitted wavelength is shorter, leading to higher T, but that resulted in a higher T2, which would increase the luminosity.

Wait, but then the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

R1 is 1.5 R2.

T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 ( T1 (1 + v/c ) )^4 )

= (2.25 R2^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T1^4 (1 + v/c )^4 )

= 2.25 / (1 + v/c )^4.

Ah, so this is different from before.

So, since (1 + v/c ) is 1.002333, (1 + v/c )^4 is approximately 1.009364.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009364 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.009364.

Let me compute this: 2.25 / 1.009364.

Well, 1.009364 is about 1 + 0.009364.

So,

2.25 / (1 + 0.009364 ) ≈ 2.25 * ( 1 - 0.009364 + 0.009364^2 - ... )

Using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x +x² -x³...

x is 0.009364.

So,

1/(1.009364 ) ≈ 1 - 0.009364 + (0.009364)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009364 + 0.0000876 ≈ 0.9907236.

So,

2.25 * 0.9907236 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907236.

Compute:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007236 ≈ 0.0016272.

So total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.0016272≈ 2.2291.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Ah, that's one of the options. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but why did I get a different result earlier? Because I made a mistake in the temperature ratio.

So to recap:

lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v/c )

Set equal.

lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 (1 + v/c )

But lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) (1 + v/c )

→ T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

So T2 is higher than T1.

Thus, when computing L1/L2, the term (T1/T2)^4 becomes (1/(1 + v/c ))^4.

Which is (1 + v/c )^(-4).

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 ) = ( (1.5 R2 )^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / ( T2^4 ) )

= (2.25) * (1/(1 + v/c )^4 )

= 2.25 * (1/(1.002333)^4 )

Earlier, we found (1.002333)^4 ≈1.009364.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * (1/1.009364 ) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907236 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, option D.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radii**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **Peak Wavelengths**: The observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T} \)), the emitted wavelengths are related to the temperatures:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
   \]
   where \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) is the radial velocity of Star_2, and \( c \) is the speed of light. This implies:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
   \]
3. **Radial Velocity**: \( v_2/c \) is small (\( v_2/c \approx 0.00233 \)), so higher-order terms can be neglected in the Doppler shift approximation.

### Step 1: Temperature Ratio
From the relationship \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2/c) \), the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}
\]

Substituting \( v_2/c \approx 0.00233 \):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 1 - 0.00233 \approx 0.99767
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.99767)^4
\]

Using the approximation \( (1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x \) for small \( x \):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.00233) \approx 1 - 0.00932 \approx 0.99068
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
Substitute \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.99068 \) into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{1} \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99068 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. Comparing this result to the options:

- **A)** ~2.25
- **B)** ~2.32
- **C)** ~2.35
- **D)** ~2.23

The closest match is **D) ~2.23**.
