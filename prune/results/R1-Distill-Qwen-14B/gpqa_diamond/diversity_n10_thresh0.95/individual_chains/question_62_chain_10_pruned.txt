--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. It's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a methylene group (because it's (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)), and that's all connected to another cyclohexane ring. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me parse that again. The main chain is cyclohexane, and the substituent is at position 1. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), meaning a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So the structure would be something like a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group attached, which is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. And there's also a formyl group (carbaldehyde) on the cyclohexane. Wait, no, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part means the cyclohexane has a formyl group (-CHO) attached to it. So the main structure is a cyclohexane with a formyl group, and at the 1-position, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that substituent is -(CH2)(cyclohexyl)(OH), I think.

So the target has two rings: one with a formyl group and a substituent, and the substituent is a CH2 connected to a cyclohexyl and an OH.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, right. So the starting material is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

So the plan is to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about the possible steps. The target has a formyl group, which suggests oxidation, perhaps. Also, there's a substitution or some kind of addition that would add the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups in the right position.

Looking at the options, the reagent sequences vary. Let's see what each step might do.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation or elimination. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. Maybe it's an alkylation. But with NaNH2, perhaps it's a Birch reduction or deprotonation. Hmm, not sure. The second reagent is H2 with Pd, which is hydrogenation. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base for elimination, maybe. The acid workup with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (which is a catalyst for oxidation, like in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids).

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq NH3 (which is for alkylation, like the Gilman reagent? Or maybe a Grignard?), then O3 and H2O, then NH4OH. Ozone followed by workup usually cleaves double bonds. So maybe an ozonolysis step.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, then O3 with (CH3)2S, then Ba(OH)2. Ozone with (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would give aldehydes/ketones instead of breaking into smaller fragments. Ba(OH)2 is again elimination.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li/liq NH3, O3 with (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

Hmm. Ok, let's start by thinking about the synthesis steps.

We have ethynylcyclohexane. So the plan is to add substituents and oxidize. The target has a formyl group, so perhaps we need to oxidize an alcohol, or a benzylic position. Alternatively, maybe an alkyne is involved.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. Maybe we can functionalize this.

First, perhaps we can add a methyl group to the triple bond. Let's think: using NaNH2 and a methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe deprotonating the ethynyl group. Wait, acetylene (ethyne) is weakly acidic, but in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, it can deprotonate. So ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 would deprotonate the triple bond, giving a cyclohexyl-ethynide ion. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate it. So the triple bond would become CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, wait. Wait, ethynide is a strong base. When you have CH2-C≡CH and deprotonate, you get CH2-C≡C^- Na^+. Then methyl chloride would provide CH3^+ Cl^-; so the ethynide would attack the methyl group, giving CH2-C≡C-CH2-... Wait, but the structure is ethynylcyclohexane, so it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So the triple bond is CH2-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So when you deprotonate, the triple bond becomes -C≡C^- and then you add a methyl group.

Wait, but wait, maybe it's more like: the ethynyl group is -CH2-C≡CH. No, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is -C≡CH attached directly. So structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 2.

So when you treat with NaNH2, the alpha proton (the one on the CH2 adjacent to the triple bond) is abstracted. Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would lead to alkylation at that position. So the CH2 would become CH(CH3), so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Wait, but wait, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH2 group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonation of the alpha hydrogen (on the CH2) would give cyclohexane-CH^- -C≡CH. Then methyl chloride would provide CH3, so the CH2 becomes CH(CH3), making cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So the position is CH2-C≡CH. So after deprotonation, you have the carbanion at the CH2, which would attack the methyl chloride to form CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

So after step 1 (NaNH2 and CH3Cl), we have cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenation with palladium would add H2 across the triple bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would add two H's, turning it into a single bond, but wait, that's a hydrogenation. Wait, when you hydrogenate an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, you get an alkane. So the triple bond would become a single bond with two H's added. So the structure would become cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, wait, no. The starting alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. After hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond is between carbons. Let me correct: the starting material is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. After hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would require adding two H's across the triple bond. Wait, no: when you hydrogenate a triple bond, you add two H's, turning it into a single bond with two more H's. Wait, ethyne (C≡CH) becomes ethane (CH2CH3) upon full hydrogenation.

So in this case, the triple bond is between the CH2 (from cyclohexane) and the next C. So after hydrogenation, the triple bond (CH2-C≡CH) becomes CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait: the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. Adding H2 would make CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not possible because each C in the triple bond has a valency limit. Wait, no, the triple bond is between the two carbons. So let me correct: the triple bond is CH2-C≡C-H. No, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So upon hydrogenation, it becomes -CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. The triple bond (C≡CH) becomes CH2 upon hydrogenation (adding two H's to each C). So the structure after hydrogenation would be CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Starting with cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Hydrogenation (H2, Pd) would add H's across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond with two H's added. So the triple bond becomes CH2-CH2, but that can't be. Wait, no. Let me think in terms of structure: the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. So when hydrogenated, each C in the triple bond (which is originally CH2 and CH) would receive two H's each. So the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH3, but that can't be right because the two C's in the triple bond are each bonded to two H's after hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the correct product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that would require adding four H's to the triple bond, which is correct because each C in the triple bond has two H's. So after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond with both C's saturated. So the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Alternatively, perhaps more accurately, the triple bond becomes a single bond with each C having two H's. So from CH2-C≡CH, adding H2 (twice) would give CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is between two carbons, so each C would have two H's added. So the product would be CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond, but that's not possible because each C can have only four bonds. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation of the alkyne would lead to a cis or trans addition, but in the case of Pd and H2, it's typically a full hydrogenation to a single bond. So the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that can't be right because the alkyne is at the end. So the correct product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, but that would make the molecule cyclohexane with a propyl group attached as CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a single bond; perhaps it's a CH2CH2CH3 group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation would add H's to each C, making the structure cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product after hydrogenation would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's more than needed.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. The starting alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. Hydrogenation adds H2 across the triple bond, turning it into CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's three carbons. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a propyl group attached to cyclohexane. So after step 2 in option C, which is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, the alkyne becomes an alkane. So the structure is now cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Let me correct. After step 1, the structure was CH(CH3)-C≡CH. Then step 2 hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, so it becomes CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the molecule is now cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a branching on the cyclohexane. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about each step again.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So NaNH2 deprotonates the alpha hydrogen (the CH2 next to the triple bond), forming a carbanion. Then methyl chloride (a methylating agent) reacts with the carbanion, adding a methyl group. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Step 2: H2/Pd. This is hydrogenation of the alkyne. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, adding two H's to each carbon. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but how? Because the alkyne is C≡CH; after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH3. So the structure would be cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So now we have a branch: a cyclohexane with a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group attached. Wait, no: the alkyne was CH2-C≡CH. After step 1, it's CH(CH3)-C≡CH, then after hydrogenation, it becomes CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But wait, that's a straight chain of three carbons attached to the cyclohexane: the CH(CH3) is attached to the cyclohexane, and then a CH2CH3 group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is a branched alkyl group.

So after step 2, the structure is now a cyclohexane with a -CH(CH3)CH2CH3 substituent.

Then step 3 in option C is O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But wait, in this structure, after step 2, there are no double bonds. The molecule is fully saturated. So how does this work? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the steps.

Wait, perhaps the reagent sequence is different. Let me consider each option again.

Looking at option C: step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, giving aldehydes or ketones. So for ozonolysis to occur, there must be a double bond. So perhaps in step 2, instead of hydrogenating the triple bond, some other reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in step 2. Let me think again: step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So that's hydrogenation. But wait, the starting alkyne (after step 1) is CH(CH3)-C≡CH. Hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, making it a single bond. So the product would be CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, right? So the molecule is cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Which is a single bond, no double bonds.

But then step 3 is ozone. Ozonolysis requires a double bond. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe it's not hydrogenation but something else. Wait, maybe step 2 in option C is not hydrogenation, but a different reaction. Wait, no, H2/Pd is hydrogenation. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is being hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, but I thought that H2 with Pd would fully hydrogenate it. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions for step 2 are different. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So that's a standard catalyst for hydrogenation, leading to full hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane.

Hmm, but then the molecule after step 2 has no double bonds, so ozonolysis in step 3 wouldn't do anything. So maybe option C isn't the right path.

Wait, perhaps the sequence in option D is more appropriate. Let's check option D.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, using NaNH2 (a strong base) with methanol. Methanol is CH3OH. So perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's for forming a Grignard or something else.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a weak acid. Maybe the base deprotonates something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a method to form a cyclohexyl lithium? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in step 1, the ethynylcyclohexane is deprotonated by NaNH2, and then methanol is added. So the ethynide would react with methanol, adding a methyl group. Wait, but methanol is CH3OH, so perhaps it's a way to add a methyl group. So the ethynyl group would get a methyl from methanol.

Wait, but methanol would provide a CH3O- group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Deprotonate the ethynyl group with NaNH2, then methylate with CH3Cl (as in step 1 of option A). But in option D, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol.

Hmm, perhaps that's a different approach. Let me think about the target again.

The target has a hydroxyl group attached to a methylene (CH2) group that's also attached to a cyclohexyl group and the main cyclohexane. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ring structure via some kind of cyclization or addition.

Wait, maybe the starting alkyne can be transformed into a ketone, which can then undergo a cycloaddition or some kind of reaction to form the necessary substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexanol derivative, which is then oxidized to a ketone and further modified.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a carbonyl group. For example, via oxidation.

But ethynylcyclohexane's oxidation could lead to a ketone if the structure allows. Alternatively, using O3 for ozonolysis would break the triple bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: alkynide formation, alkylation, hydrogenation, then ozonolysis, then further reactions.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this step by step.

The target molecule has a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a cyclohexane ring. Also, at position 1, there's a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the formyl group comes from oxidation of an alcohol, and the cyclohexyl group comes from some kind of ring-opening or substitution.

Let me think about the possible reagents and their functions.

Reagent 1 in option C is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. As discussed, this would add a methyl group to the ethynyl position.

Reagent 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making the structure have a longer alkyl chain.

Reagent 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but after step 2, the molecule has no double bonds. So this doesn't fit. Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. How?

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't full, but partial. Wait, no, H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate alkyne to alkane.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that introduces a double bond. But I don't think Pd does that. Wait, maybe the hydrogenation is selective. Or perhaps the step is something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong option. Let's think about option B.

Option B: steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq NH3; then O3 and H2O; then NH4OH.

So step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So deprotonate to form the ethynide, then add ethyl group. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et (ethyl group).

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or alkylation. But in this case, maybe it's for eliminating the ethyl group or adding another substituent.

Alternatively, Li in liquid NH3 is used for the formation of organometallic compounds, like the Gilman reagent, which can add to carbonyls. But I'm not sure how that fits here.

Then step 3 is O3 followed by H2O, which would break any double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Then step 4 is treatment with NH4OH, which is ammonium hydroxide, perhaps to work up an ozonolysis or for acid-base reactions.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me think about the overall process.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to add a methyl group to the ethynyl position, then perform a hydrogenation to introduce a double bond, and then ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but let me think about the target structure again. The target has a formyl group, so maybe the starting alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: using the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction to add a bromide to the alpha position, but I don't see any bromide steps in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via oxidation. Ozone would cleave the alkyne into two carbonyls, but the presence of HgSO4 and H2SO4 suggests an acid-catalyzed workup, which would lead to carboxylic acids.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to look for the formyl group in the target. The formyl group suggests a carbonyl at the end of a chain. So perhaps the alkyne is cleaved to form two carbonyls, one of which is further oxidized.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed to form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyls.

4. Workup to form the desired groups.

Let me consider option C again:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → add methyl to alkyne → CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond → CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But then no double bond, so ozonolysis in step 3 would do nothing. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the steps are meant to form a diene, which would then be ozonolyzed.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about each option's reagents and what they do.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps methylates the ethynyl group, but I'm not sure.

2. Li/liq NH3 → maybe adds a methyl group via a Grignard-like reaction.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S → ozonolysis with a reductive workup.

4. NH4OH → ammonium hydroxide, perhaps to form amine or for acidic workup.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 in D is forming a lithium compound, which then reacts.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add a methyl group, then reduce the triple bond to a double bond, then ozonolyze to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think.

If the alkyne is first alkylated to become CH(CH3)-C≡CH, then perhaps hydrogenated in a way that leaves a double bond. Wait, but H2/Pd would hydrogenate it all the way to a single bond. So that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps hydrogenation under different conditions would stop at the double bond, but I don't think that's the case with H2 and Pd.

Another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation. For example, using O3 in acidic conditions would break the alkyne into two carbonyl groups. But the target has a formyl group, so perhaps one of the carbonyls is a formyl.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH) would, upon ozonolysis, break into two fragments: a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group and a formyl group. Let's see: breaking the triple bond, the structure would become cyclohexane-CHO and HCOOH (if using oxidative workup). But that's not matching the target, which has a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the triple bond is ozonolyzed. For example, if the triple bond is CH(CH3)-C≡CH, ozonolysis would cut it into two carbonyls: a ketone and a formyl group. So the structure would become cyclohexane-C(O)CH(CH3) and HCOOH. That doesn't directly form the target, but perhaps further reactions could.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So perhaps the cyclohexane ring in the target is derived from the original ethynylcyclohexane, but with additional substituents.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about each option's steps.

Option C: steps are methylate, hydrogenate, ozonolyze, and then Ba(OH)2.

After step 1, structure is CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

Step 2: hydrogenate to CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Now, no double bonds. Step 3: O3 wouldn't do anything. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option B: steps are methylate (ethyl?), then Li/NH3, then O3, then NH4OH.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves forming a ketone, then reducing it.

Wait, perhaps the target's formyl group comes from oxidation of an alcohol. So maybe the alcohol is formed by some addition reaction.

Let me think about the target structure. It has a formyl group, which is at the end of a chain. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone, and then further modified.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the formyl group in the target. The formyl is at the end, so maybe the alkyne is oxidized to a ketone, which is then further modified.

But I'm not seeing how the options fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reagents are in option C. Let's think again.

Option C: step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes and ketones. Step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base for elimination reactions, perhaps forming rings.

Wait, after step 2, the structure is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a single bond, so ozonolysis can't happen. So maybe I'm missing something in step 2.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option C isn't hydrogenation but something else. Wait, the reagent is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Oh, wait! Pd on CaCO3 is often used for hydrogenation, but perhaps if it's a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, it would hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene. But no, the option says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is standard for full hydrogenation.

Wait, but perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else. Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a reduction that forms a double bond, like using LiAlH4 in some way. Hmm, but the reagents are H2 and Pd.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking about the steps in the wrong order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

2. The triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, perhaps via a different catalyst that stops at the cis or trans alkene. But I'm not sure if H2/Pd would do that. Usually, Pd fully hydrogenates the triple bond.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think of each option's overall process.

Option C's steps:

1. Methylate the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate alkyne to alkane.

3. Ozonolysis → no double bonds → no reaction.

So that can't be right.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this adds a methyl group via alkylation. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, perhaps a Birch reduction or deprotonation. Then ozonolysis and workup.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Deprotonate and eliminate to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

4. Workup to form the desired groups.

But I'm not seeing it clearly.

Another angle: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So perhaps a substitution reaction where a hydroxyl group is added.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a Grignard reagent, which attacks a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reagents are:

1. Alkylation to form a di-substituted alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to form a di-substituted alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two carbonyls.

4. Acid workup to form carboxylic acids or ketones.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a nucleophilic addition. For example, the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which then undergoes some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkynide formation and alkylation → add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene (but I'm not sure if H2/Pd would do that).

3. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyls.

4. Workup to form the desired aldehyde.

But I'm not confident.

After considering all options, perhaps option C is the correct one. Let me walk through it again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH(CH3)-C≡CH.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S → but no double bonds, so no reaction. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe after step 2, the structure has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenation but a reduction that forms a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the product of the hydrogenation. Let me think again. If the alkyne is CH(CH3)-C≡CH, hydrogenation would make it CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So no double bond. So ozonolysis can't proceed.

So perhaps the correct option is another one.

Wait, looking at option B:

Steps are:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-Et.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps forms a Grignard reagent, which could add to a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

3. O3/H2O → cleaves any double bonds into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → perhaps workup to form amines or for acidic conditions.

I'm not sure, but perhaps this sequence forms the necessary carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl or ethyl group.

2. The alkyne is then hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene.

3. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls.

But I don't see an option that fits this exactly.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B's step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is often used for deprotonation or elimination. Maybe after alkylation, the structure is something like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et. Then, step 2 could be deprotonation followed by elimination to form a double bond. For example, removing a proton to form a triple bond adjacent to a leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

I'm not getting much further. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 is often used for elimination reactions, like forming alkenes from alcohols. But if the previous step didn't generate any alcohols, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, despite the confusion. Because after step 3, the molecule might have the necessary carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)2 could perform an elimination to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a substituent at the 1-position, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming cyclohexane-CH(CH₃)-C≡CH.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane, resulting in cyclohexane-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. This step introduces a saturated chain but no double bonds.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, typically used for elimination, but no suitable leaving group is present in the molecule after step 2.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxidative workup, but the molecule lacks functional groups that would react under these conditions.

This sequence does not align with the target structure, as no steps introduce the formyl group or the hydroxyl group required in the target.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and alkylates it with an ethyl group, forming cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡C-Et.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for deprotonation or elimination, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but the molecule lacks double bonds after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Aqueous workup, but the sequence does not clearly form the required functional groups.

This sequence is ambiguous and does not clearly lead to the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming cyclohexane-CH(CH₃)-C≡CH.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane, resulting in cyclohexane-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. This step introduces a saturated chain but no double bonds.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires double bonds, but the molecule lacks them after step 2. This step does not contribute to the synthesis.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but no suitable leaving group is present to facilitate elimination or ring formation.

This sequence does not align with the target structure, as no steps introduce the formyl group or the hydroxyl group required in the target.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group from methanol, forming cyclohexane-CH(CH₃)-C≡CH.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for deprotonation or elimination, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires double bonds, but the molecule lacks them after step 2. This step does not contribute to the synthesis.
4. **NH₄OH**: Aqueous workup, but the sequence does not clearly form the required functional groups.

This sequence is ambiguous and does not clearly lead to the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly lead to the target molecule. However, **Option C** is the most plausible because it includes steps that could potentially form the necessary substituents, even though the reasoning for ozonolysis is unclear.
