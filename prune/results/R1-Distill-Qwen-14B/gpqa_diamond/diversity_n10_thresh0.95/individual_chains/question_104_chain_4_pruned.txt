Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets detected using the RV method. Both planets are similar in mass to Neptune. The stars are identical, so their masses are the same.

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The shift tells us about the star's movement due to the planet's gravity. So, a bigger shift probably means a more massive planet or a closer orbit, right? Or wait, maybe it's more about the mass of the planet and the orbital period. I remember the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is something like K = (V) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / (2π * (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ), but since the planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are much more massive, maybe I can assume M_planet is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, since the orbits are circular, eccentricity e is zero. So the denominator's 1 - e² squared terms go away.

Wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K (the velocity shift) is K = [ (G * M_planet) / (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ] * [ (1) / ( (2π P)^(1/3) ) ) ] ] * (1 / (1 AU)^(1/3) )) Hmm, maybe I should get the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the key relation is that K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (2π)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to look for the formula that relates K with the orbital period.

Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ), where i is the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are detected, I can assume their orbital planes are aligned so that sin i is roughly similar, perhaps we can assume it's the same for both. Since the question says the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (so M_p is same for both), then K should be proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). 

Wait, no, actually, the formula is K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (2π G)) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) ) ) ) * (something else? Maybe I'm mixing it up.)

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (2π))^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since both planets have circular orbits, and M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so this simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (2π)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

But since sin i is probably the same for both (assuming we observe them optimally), and M_p and M_* are same for both, then K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, if K1 is the velocity shift for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = (some constant) * 1/(P1^(1/3) ), same for K2.

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) ) 

Wait, because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let me think. Let's say K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)). So K1 = C / (P1^(1/3)), K2 = C / (P2^(1/3)).

Then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, let's compute K1/K2:

K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3)) ) = (
