Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration problems. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two pH values. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the total volume becomes 40 mL. Wait, but when you add equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? Because concentration is moles per liter. So the initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume in liters.

So, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Diluting with 20 mL water makes the total volume 40 mL, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, that's 25 mM. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. That's important because when we titrate, the amount of NaOH added affects this.

Next, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. So, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So, for equivalence, NaOH needs to provide 0.001 mol as well. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So for 25%, it's 25% of 10 mL, which is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait, the first part is the diluted solution, so maybe I should compute the diluted acetic acid's concentration first, which I did: 0.025 M. Then, the moles in 40 mL is 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. So same as before.

So, equivalence point volume is 10 mL of NaOH. So at 25% titration, we're adding 2.5 mL of NaOH. So let's calculate the pH at two points: 25% of the way to equivalence, and exactly at equivalence.

First, let's tackle the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, how much NaOH has been added? 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH, producing CH3COO^-.

So initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol. So, moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of solution will be the initial 40 mL plus 2.5 mL NaOH added. So 42.5 mL, which is 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here because we have a buffer solution. Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256, approximately 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions yet.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculations. Because sometimes when I'm approximating, I might make a mistake.

Wait, let me compute [CH3COOH] and [CH3COO^-] again accurately.

Moles CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 mL +2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is exactly log(1/3) which is about -0.477.

So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So at 25% titration, pH is around 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

Moles of NaOH at equivalence: 0.001 mol, as calculated earlier. Volume is 10 mL.

So total volume is 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL = 0.05 L.

The solution now contains 0.001 mol of CH3COO^- (acetate ions), which comes from the reaction with NaOH. Since NaOH is a strong base, the solution will be basic because the acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid).

So, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

We can set up the expression for Kb. Let me denote [OH^-] as x.

At initial, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. So, the change will be -x (for acetate) and +x (for OH^- and CH3COOH).

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 /0.02, since x will be very small.

So sqrt(Kb * 0.02) = x.

x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98, so pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but the options don't have 9.02. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka. Let me recompute.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (approx) 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So, Kb is 5.405e-10.

Now, for the concentration 0.02 M acetate.

So, the Kb expression:

Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH-] = 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = log(1/(1.04e-5)) → wait, no, pOH is -log(1.04e-5).

Log(1.04e-5) is log(1.04) + (-5) → 0.017 -5 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983.

Then, pH = 14 - 4.983 = 9.017, approximately 9.02.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have the equivalence point around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, so none of them have 9.02. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, perhaps I forgot that when at equivalence point, the solution is made of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic, but perhaps I should consider the exact calculation.

Let me go through the calculations again.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

So,

x² = Kb * (0.02)

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is 4.98, pH is about 9.02.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should not have considered the dilution correctly. Wait, when we add 10 mL of NaOH to the 40 mL solution, the total volume is 50 mL.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial dilution is not 0.025 M because when you add 20 mL to 20 mL, the concentration is half.

Wait, let me double-check the initial dilution.

Original volume: 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Adding 20 mL of water, total volume 40 mL.

So, the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 mL) / 40 mL = 0.025 M. So that's correct.

So at equivalence, 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So, correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Kb. Let me double-check the Kb calculation.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5.

So, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm, but why are the options not matching? Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52. So the second value is 8.52. So maybe my calculation is wrong somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or something else, but I think that's beyond the scope of this problem. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the weak base calculation.

Wait, another approach: The pH at equivalence point for a weak acid with strong base is higher than 7. So the options with equivalence pH around 7 are C and D. So option C has 7.00 and D has 6.92.

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's about 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the equivalence point is basic. Wait, no, sodium acetate is definitely basic. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the moles. Let me recompute the moles at equivalence point.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So, when we add 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, moles of NaOH are 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol. So, yes, equivalence point.

So the acetate ion is 0.001 mol in 50 mL (0.05 L), which gives 0.02 M.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the exact approach without assuming x is negligible.

Let me try the exact method.

The equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial concentration: 0.02 M.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

So,

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

Approximating x as negligible compared to 0.02, x² ≈ 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5, as before.

So pOH is about 4.98, pH 9.02.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I missed something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the pH using the formula for a weak base without the approximation.

Wait, another approach: Using the hydrolysis equation.

The formula for a weak base is:

pH = (pKb - log C)/2 + pOH? Wait, no, that's for weak acids. Alternatively, perhaps the pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak base.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute [OH^-] using the exact quadratic equation.

So,

x² = Kb (0.02 - x)

x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb = 0.

Substituting Kb =5.405e-10,

x² + 5.405e-10 x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) = 0

Which is x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11.

(5.405e-10)^2 is approx 2.92e-19.

4 *1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

So discriminant is 4.324e-11 + 2.92e-19 ≈ 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Wait, because the other solution would be negative, so we take the positive root.

So,

x ≈ (6.576e-6) / 2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

Wait, that's different from the earlier value. So [OH^-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) = approx 5.485, so pH = 14 -5.485 ≈ 8.515, which is about 8.52.

Ah! So I think I made a mistake earlier by approximating x as negligible. Using the exact quadratic approach, the [OH^-] is about 3.288e-6, which gives a pH of approximately 8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52. So looking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52.

So at 25% titration, pH is 4.26, and at equivalence, 8.52. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the equivalence point pH would be around 9.02. But now, using the quadratic approach, it's about 8.52. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, I think the initial approximation (x negligible) was not valid, so the more accurate calculation using the quadratic formula gives a higher [OH^-], leading to a lower pH (higher acidity, but since it's basic, lower pH is more acidic? No, wait. Wait, higher [OH^-] means more basic, which should mean a lower pH? Wait no, pH is 14 - pOH. So higher [OH^-] implies lower pOH, which implies higher pH.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is 4.98, pH=9.02.

If [OH^-] is 3.288e-6, pOH is 5.485, pH=8.515. So that's a higher pH than the previous incorrect calculation. So why did the exact method give a lower [OH^-]?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me recheck.

The quadratic equation when using the exact method.

The equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

The discriminant is b² -4ac.

Wait, wait, no: the quadratic is ax² + bx + c =0. In our case, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant D = b² -4*a*c = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

Which is (2.92e-19) +4.324e-11 = approximately 4.324e-11 + something negligible.

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

Then, the positive root is [-b + sqrt(D)]/(2a).

So,

[-5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 6.576e-6 /2 =3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485.

pH=14-5.485=8.515.

So pH is approximately 8.52.

That matches option A's second value, 8.52.

So now, at 25% titration, the pH is about 4.26, and at equivalence, 8.52. So option A is correct.

But wait, earlier I thought that at equivalence, the pH should be higher than 7, which it is (8.52), so option A seems correct.

So, putting it all together: at 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, it's 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the diluted concentration of acetic acid. Initially, there are **20.00 cm³ (0.02 L)** of **0.05 M acetic acid**, containing:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with **20.00 cm³ of water**, the total volume is **40.00 cm³ (0.04 L)**. The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, **2.5 mL (0.0025 L)** of **0.1 M NaOH** is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Remaining moles of acetic acid: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume is now **42.5 mL (0.0425 L)**. The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming **0.001 mol of acetate ion**. The total volume is now **50 mL (0.05 L)**, so the concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant, \(K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\). Using the approximation \(K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}\), where \(x = [\text{OH}^-]\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, using the exact quadratic solution for \(x\), the pH is recalculated to be approximately **8.52**. This matches the equivalence point value in **Option A**.

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is **4.26**, and at the equivalence point, the pH is **8.52**. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
