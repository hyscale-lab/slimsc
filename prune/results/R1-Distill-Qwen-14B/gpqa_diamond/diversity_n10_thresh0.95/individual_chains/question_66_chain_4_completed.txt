Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think it's an effective theory, so it incorporates the Standard Model but includes higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the SM physics. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc.

Now, symmetries. Effective theories should respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, right? The Standard Model respects certain symmetries. What are they?

Lorentz symmetry is definitely one. Because all interactions in the SM are Lorentz-invariant, so SMEFT should preserve that. Otherwise, the theory would be inconsistent with relativity.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if Lorentz is respected, does Poincare automatically hold? Or is it a separate thing? I think Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translational invariance (momentum conservation). Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should be Poincare-invariant. I'm not sure if the question treats these as separate or linked. But the options suggest they're separate.

Wait, the question is which must be respected by all operators. So operators in SMEFT must have the same symmetries as the SM, except perhaps for some explicit breaking, but I don't think SMEFT breaks these unless we add specific terms. Or does it?

Wait, no. Effective theories typically don't break the underlying symmetries. Because SMEFT is an effective theory valid up to some cutoff, the low-energy symmetries should be the same as the full theory. So SM respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. What about CP?

The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT wouldn't necessarily respect CP symmetry. Thus, option 3 (CP symmetry) is not a must. So the correct symmetries that all SMEFT operators must respect would be Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators." That implies that any operator in the theory must be invariant under these symmetries. So all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant, Poincare invariant, and CPT invariant. But what about CP?

Because the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, the SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, the answer would include Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

Let me think about the options. The options are:

1. Lorentz
2. Poincare
3. CP
4. CPT

The question is which must be respected by all operators.

So all SMEFT operators must respect 1, 2, and 4. Which option is that?

Looking at the options: option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but I should double-check. What about Poincare symmetry? Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must be Poincare-invariant. So yes, all operators must transform accordingly, so Poincare is respected.

And CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry. The SM (and hence SMEFT) respects CPT. So all operators must respect CPT.

So the correct symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So the answer is C.

Wait, but I thought Poincare was a separate symmetry. Or is Poincare symmetry included in Lorentz? No, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So both 1 and 2 are separate, and the operators must respect both.

So the answer should include 1,2,4. So option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) and includes higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond-the-SM physics. These operators must respect the same symmetries as the underlying SM, except in cases where explicit symmetry breaking is introduced.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of the SM and must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Any operator that violates Lorentz symmetry would make the theory inconsistent with relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translational invariance (momentum conservation). Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry. While Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincaré symmetry, they are treated as separate symmetries in this context.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is already a feature of the SM.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of the SM and must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Any violation of CPT symmetry would have profound implications for the theory.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry for SMEFT operators.

**Answer: C**
