Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see... The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI usually lead to some kind of substitution or elimination reaction. Wait, I think that's related to the Hunsdiecker reaction or maybe the reduction of a double bond, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The data given are IR and NMR, so I'll start by analyzing those.

Looking at the IR data: strong absorption between 3400â€“2500 cm-1 suggests the presence of an -OH group. The peak at 1720 cm-1 likely corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O), maybe a ketone or an aldehyde. The peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could indicate aromatic rings, possibly with substituents. The 1610 might be a C=C stretch, and the 1450 could be stretching in the aromatic ring, maybe para substitution.

Now the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably an -OH proton. Maybe from a carboxylic acid? Because the broad peak often indicates hydrogen bonding, which is common in carboxylic acids. But wait, another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in this case, the peak is broad, which fits better with a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but some other functional groups could have broad peaks. Like an alcohol, but that's less likely. Let me note that the 10.5 ppm peak is probably an -OH from a carboxylic acid.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest they're in a para-substituted aromatic ring because the coupling would be between two sets of protons. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents at para positions. The 8.0 ppm is probably the protons next to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. So maybe a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group attached.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That's a multiplet, maybe a CH group adjacent to something else. Like a CH connected to a carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Or perhaps it's part of a branched chain.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, possibly CH2 groups. Maybe part of a substituent attached to the benzene ring. Like a CH2 that's next to another CH or something else.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Like a CH(CH3) group. So maybe an isopropyl group or a substituent with a methyl group attached to a CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal CH3 group, probably attached to a CH2. So that would make a longer chain, like an ethyl or propyl group.

Putting this together: The aromatic ring has substituents at para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (from the IR 1720 cm-1 and the 10.5 ppm peak). So maybe a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and another substituent, perhaps an isobutyl group or something similar.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak as a broad singlet suggests a carboxylic acid, not a ketone. Because ketones don't have protons attached. Oh wait, but the IR 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl, which could be a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid; usually they are around 1700-1725, but maybe it's a conjugated acid? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, but then the IR would have a peak lower than 1720? Or perhaps it's a ketone, but then the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't fit. Wait, another possibility is that the 1720 is an ester or an aldehyde. But the NMR doesn't show an aldehyde proton. Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid than an aldehyde. Aldehydes usually give sharp singlets around 9-10 ppm. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, wait. If the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid, then the IR should show a broad O-H stretch, which it does in the 3400-2500 region. So that fits. So the compound could be a benzoic acid derivative.

So putting this together: a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. The substituent's NMR signals:

- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to the aromatic ring. Let's say it's attached to a CH(CH3) group or something similar.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to that CH group.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH group, as in a -CH(CH3)- structure.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a methyl group, making a longer chain.

Wait, that might make a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let me draw it out. The substituent is connected to the benzene ring. So if the benzene has a -COOH group at one para position and another group at the opposite (para) position.

So the substituent at para to the COOH is a group that has a CH group, a CH2 group, and a CH3. Hmm...

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2 (the 1.7 ppm m, 2H). So the structure would be something like -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but wait, how does that fit with the other signals?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but with branching. Maybe a sec-butyl group. Because the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which would be a methyl group attached to a CH that's also attached to another CH2.

Wait, let's think about substituent structure.

We have:

- A para-substituted benzene with a COOH group.

- Another substituent at the para position, which is a group with a CH, CH2, and a CH3.

So for example, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? Hmm, but the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, so that's a terminal CH3. So that would be like CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl group. But wait, the 1.7 ppm is a CH2 connected to a CH, and the CH has a CH3 attached.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-R group. Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but connected in a way that forms a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, like isobutyl.

Wait, an isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. But looking at the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is the CH of the isobutyl group, which is connected to two CH3 groups. So that would make sense.

But wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which is a CH3 connected to a CH2. So if the substituent is an isobutyl group, the structure would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2. But wait, that's a tert-butyl group. No, wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait: isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recall:

- The structure for an isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, isobutyl is actually a four-carbon group: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps looking at the NMR again. The substituent's protons are:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups? Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that might need more protons than I'm seeing. Alternatively, it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps substituent is a propyl chain with a branching. Let's say it's a butyl group in a particular configuration.

Wait, another way: The substituent is a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group but with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

But perhaps a better approach is to see what the substituent looks like.

The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. Let's say it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that's a tert-butyl group. But then the NMR would show a single CH3, but here I have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is likely the end of a chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. But that would have a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait, no: an isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), no. Wait, no. Let me correct. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that's actually a tert-butyl group. Wait, no, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The structure of isobutyl is:

The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, no. Wait, no. Isobutyl is a four-carbon substituent where the branching is on the second carbon. So it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should just draw it. Let's see: the substituent is a four-carbon group with a branch. For example, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be a pentyl group? No, wait, the substituent is attached to the ring. Wait, no, the substituent should be a single group attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a four-carbon substituent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that's longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the NMR. The substituent's protons:

- 2.9 ppm: 1H, multiplet. This is likely the CH group in a substituent. So maybe a CH attached to two other CH2 groups and a methyl.

Wait, but how? Let's think about isopropyl. An isopropyl group has a CH connected to two CH3 groups. But then the NMR would show a septet for the CH (if it's a triplet of septets or something), but in this case, it's a multiplet.

Alternatively, it's a propyl group with a branch. Like a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's protons add up to 3H (d, 3H at 1.4 ppm), 2H (m at 1.7), 1H (m at 2.9), and 3H (t at 0.9). That's 3+2+1+3 = 9 protons, but the substituent probably doesn't have that many. So maybe the substituent is a butyl group with some branching.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group. Wait, the substituent has a CH group (1H), a CH2 (2H), a CH3 (3H) attached to something, and a terminal CH3. Wait, that's like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a four-carbon substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an isopropyl group, but that would have a CH and two CH3 groups. But the NMR shows only one triplet for the 3H (at 1.4 ppm), which would be a single methyl group attached to a CH. So maybe it's a substituent like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. But that would make the structure more complex.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that's a tert-butyl group, which would have a singlet for the CH3 groups, but in this case, the methyl is a doublet, which doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: the substituent could be a secondary butyl group, like a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. But I'm getting stuck.

Perhaps it's easier to think about the possible options given. Let's look at the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, Compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. That's a typical reaction for the Hunsdiecker reaction, which is used to convert alkyl halides to alkenes via elimination. But wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used to reduce a carbonyl group, like in the Clemmensen reduction. Wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Another possibility is that the reaction is a hydration or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis. Wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are often used to cleave double bonds. For example, in the hydrohalogenation or in some elimination reactions. Alternatively, if the starting material has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's being reduced.

Wait, but looking at the options, the products are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings. So perhaps the reaction is a substitution or reduction.

Wait, the initial compound has a carbonyl group (from IR 1720), which could be a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad peak, probably a carboxylic acid. So if the initial compound is benzoic acid with a substituent, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI could be a reduction.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can reduce esters or ketones. For example, an ester can be reduced to an alcohol. Alternatively, a ketone can be reduced to a secondary alcohol.

But the IR data also includes a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is typical for C=C stretching. So perhaps the molecule has an aromatic ring and maybe another double bond.

Wait, so putting it all together: the initial compound is 4-(something)benzoic acid. Because the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 (carbonyl), and the NMR shows the broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (carboxylic acid proton). So the structure is likely a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent at the para position.

Now, the substituent's NMR is as follows: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). So the substituent is a chain attached to the benzene ring.

Let me think about each option:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 4? Wait, no: 4-(sec-butyl) would mean the substituent is at position 4 relative to the COOH group, which is in position 1 perhaps. Wait, no, the numbering would be such that the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 if they're para. Wait, maybe the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4.

So 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have a COOH group at position 1 and the sec-butyl group at position 4.

What's the structure of the substituent? Sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no: sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait: the structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, no. Let's get it right. Butyl groups have four carbons. The structure of sec-butyl is: the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So, it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, let me write it properly: the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, that's not right. The structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that's not correct. Wait, let me get the structure right. The butyl group is four carbons. The substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no. For a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH
