Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out its chemical formula from the options given.

First, the FTIR data. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. The other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those might be carbonyl groups. 1700 is often a carbonyl (C=O) like in a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl maybe? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated double bond or something else. Wait, maybe one is a C=O and the other is a C=C stretch? Because C=C usually absorbs around 1600-1680 cm^-1. So maybe 1700 is a carbonyl (like an ester or ketone) and 1650 is a conjugated C=C, perhaps in an aromatic ring or a double bond adjacent to something else.

Then, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl H's are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule must have a double bond, maybe in a ring or an alkene group.

The mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what that could be. Common fragments at 45 might be something like (CH3)2O, which is 45. Or maybe another combination. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of C3H7O, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: the molecular ion peak might break into smaller fragments. For example, if the compound is an ester, maybe it cleaves into an acid and an alcohol. Or if it's a ketone or something else.

Now, looking at the options: the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Let me consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation? Let me calculate that. Degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc. Or one double bond and one ring? Wait, no, each ring or double bond contributes one. So 1 degree: maybe one double bond and one ring, or two rings, or something else. Wait, but for C6H12O2, let's see: 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. If it's an ester, maybe. Esters have the formula RCOOR', so the formula would be something like CnH2nO2. Wait, for C6H12O2, n would be 3? Let me see: RCOOR' would be (3 carbons for R, 3 for R') plus the ester O, so maybe like methyl propionate: CH3COOCH2CH2CH3? But that would be C3H6O2. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Or maybe a diester? Alternatively, another possibility is that the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group, but I'm not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. Let's calculate degree of unsaturation. (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be two double bonds, or a double bond and a ring, or two rings. So maybe an aromatic ring (which is a ring plus double bonds), but that would be high. Alternatively, if it's a cyclohexene with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6+2-10*2)/2? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So that could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond.

Now, the FTIR: the broad peak suggests an O-H group, so the compound must have at least one hydroxyl group. The strong peak at 1700 and 1650: the 1700 might be a carbonyl, which could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or something else. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So the molecule has a double bond.

Putting this together: O-H, double bond, and a carbonyl group.

So maybe it's a compound with an ester group and an alcohol. Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H would have been from an acid and an alcohol, but esters don't have O-H groups. Wait, unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm, maybe a beta-keto ester? Or a compound with both an ester and an alcohol group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. But then the FTIR would have a broad peak from the -COOH group.

Wait, the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which could be either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be quite broad and in a different region, perhaps. Or maybe the broadness is more indicative of an alcohol. Hmm.

Let me think about the options again. We have to have an O-H group, a double bond, and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options:

Option C: C6H10O2. Two oxygen atoms. Possible structures: ester and alcohol? But esters don't have O-H. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an alcohol. So RCO-R-OH? Or perhaps a cyclic ketone with an alcohol? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the mass spectrum. The fragment peak at m/z 45. What could that be? 45 is the molecular weight for (CH3)2O, which is 15 + 15 +15 (wait, no: (CH3)2O is (2*(15) + 16) = 46? Oh wait, no. Let me calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16.

(CH3)2O: 2*(CH3) = 2*(12+3*1) = 2*(15)=30, plus O is 16. Total is 46. So 46 is for (CH3)2O.

But the fragment is at 45. Hmm. Close. Maybe something else. Or perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a different group. Or maybe it's a CH3COO- group. Wait, CH3COO has a molecular weight of 60 (12*2 +1*4 +16*2=24+4+32=60). Hmm, no, that's larger than 45.

Another idea: the fragment could be a CH2CH2O+ ion? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a different structure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's think about what each option implies.

Option A: C6H12O2 would have a degree of unsaturation of 1. So one ring or one double bond. But we have a double bond (from the vinyl H in NMR) and possibly a carbonyl (another double bond). Wait, but that would require two degrees of unsaturation. Hmmm, but the degree of unsaturation for C6H12O2 is (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one degree, which can be either a ring or a double bond. But wait, the presence of a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl (from IR) would imply two double bonds, which would require a degree of unsaturation of 2. So that would not fit with option A, which has a degree of 1.

Hmm, that's a problem. So if the molecule has a double bond (from the vinyl H) and a carbonyl (from IR), that's two double bonds, so degree of unsaturation should be 2. So looking at the options, which ones have a degree of unsaturation of 2?

Looking back:

Option B: C6H10O. Degree of 2.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of 2.

Option D: C6H12O. Degree of 1.

So options B and C have the required degrees.

So the compound must have two degrees of unsaturation, so it must be either option B or C.

So moving on.

The FTIR: 1700 and 1650. If the compound has a carbonyl, say at 1700, that could be an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. The peak at 1650 could be another carbonyl or a conjugated double bond.

But given that the NMR shows vinyl H's, which are on a double bond, perhaps the 1650 peak is a conjugated double bond, like an alkene. So maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is a conjugated double bond.

So the molecule has both a carbonyl group and a double bond, which would account for the two degrees of unsaturation.

Now, looking at the options, let's think about esters. Esters have a carbonyl (around 1700) and an ether linkage. But they don't have O-H groups. Wait, but our FTIR shows an O-H. So perhaps it's not an ester.

Another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto ester or something with both a carbonyl and an O-H group. Or maybe a hemiacetal, but that might complicate things.

Wait, what about a cyclic ester, like a lactone? No, because that would be an ester and no O-H. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an adjacent hydroxyl group. Like a secondary alcohol with a ketone. So for example, something like cyclohexanone with a hydroxyl group. Let's say the structure is cyclopentanone with a CH2CH2OH group attached. But wait, that would give an O-H and a carbonyl, but where's the double bond? If the molecule has a double bond, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: if the molecule is a dienol ether or something with a conjugated diene. Not sure.

Wait, considering the mass spec again. The fragment peak at m/z 45. 45 is 12 + 12 + 21? No. Wait, 45 could be CH2CH2O+, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, it's the molecular ion of something else.

Wait, another approach: calculate the molecular weight of each option.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular formula: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 16=16. Total 72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 6*12=72, 10=10, 2*16=32. 72+10+32=114.

Option A: C6H12O2. 72 +12 +32=116.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100.

So the molecular weights are 98, 114, 116, 100.

The mass spectrum fragment at 45. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, if the molecular ion breaks into a smaller fragment, perhaps the O-H group breaks off as water (m/z 18), but that doesn't match 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a functional group. For instance, if the compound is an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks off. Wait, if it's an ester, RCOOR', the fragment could be RCOO+ at m/z 45. Let's see: what would RCOO be? Let's see, RCOO has a molecular weight of (n carbons in R)*12 + (2n+1)*1 + 16*2? Wait, not sure. Wait, let's think of specific possibilities.

Wait, 45 is a possible mass for something like CH3COO-. Let's compute: CH3COO- is (12*2 + 1*4 + 16*2) = 24 +4 +32=60. No. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH3)2O, which is 15+15+16=46. Hmm, that's close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe (CH2)2O, which is (24) +16=40. No.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for each option.

Option B: C6H10O. Let's think about possible structures. It could be something like cyclohexene with an alcohol group. But how would that fit with the IR?

Alternatively, maybe a diene with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's see. Two oxygens. Could be an ester and an alcohol? Or a carboxylic acid and an alcohol? Wait, no, because a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl and an O-H. Wait, but if it's a diol with a carbonyl group, maybe. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the FTIR has a peak at 1700 which is a strong carbonyl. So if the molecule has a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. But the presence of O-H suggests maybe a ketone and an alcohol.

But wait, if it's a ketone and an alcohol, the structure would have both groups. Let's say something like 2-butanone with a hydroxyl group. But in such a structure, the O-H would be a broad peak, the ketone would be around 1700, and the double bond (if any) would be at 1650? Or maybe the 1650 is a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection to the NMR's vinyl groups. Wait, the NMR shows vinyl H, which implies a double bond. So the molecule has a double bond and a carbonyl. So perhaps a conjugated dienone or something. Alternatively, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl, causing the C=C peak around 1650.

So now, considering that, let's think of a structure that has a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond.

If the structure is something like an enol ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, it could be a cyclic ester, but cyclic esters (lactones) don't have O-H groups. Wait, but what about a diester? Not sure.

Alternatively, if the formula is C6H10O2, it could be an aromatic compound with substituents. But then the NMR would show aromatic protons, which might not match the given data.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H's, which are typically in alkenes. So perhaps the structure has a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's think of a structure with a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl. Like a cyclic ketone with a double bond. Or perhaps a dienone.

For example, consider a compound with a structure like:

O
||
C - C = C - R

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, think of a molecule like methyl vinyl ketone, which is (prop-1-en-2-yl) methyl ketone. Its formula is C4H6O. But that's not matching the options here.

Another approach: think about the degrees of unsaturation, which for option C is 2. So either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

The FTIR shows a carbonyl and a double bond, so that's two double bonds or a ring plus a double bond. But in any case, the two degrees are accounted for.

So, putting this together, the compound has:

- O-H group (broad peak at 3000)
- Carbonyl (1700)
- Double bond (1650 and vinyl H in NMR)
- An ester group? Or maybe a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, but if it's a ketone and an alcohol, then the formula would have two oxygen atoms. So that fits with option C (C6H10O2) or option A (C6H12O2). But earlier, I thought that option A's degree of unsaturation is only 1, which wouldn't account for both the carbonyl and the double bond. So perhaps option C is the correct one.

Wait, let's think about the mass spec again. If the fragment is at 45, let's see if any of the options could lose a group that weighs 45.

For option C: C6H10O2. If the molecule breaks into two parts, perhaps a fragment of 45 and the rest.

What's 45 in terms of possible groups? Let's calculate. 45 is 12 + 12 + 12 + 9? No, not helpful.

Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O, which would be 45? Let me calculate: (CH2)2O is 2*(12+2*1) + 16 = 2*(14) +16 = 28 +16=44. No, not 45.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O. So maybe a propyl group attached to something else.

Alternatively, 45 is 45 = 12 * a + 1 * b +16 * c. Let's see possible combinations.

But maybe it's easier to think of the possible molecular formula for the fragment. 45 would be C3H7O (12*3 +7 +16 =36+7+16=59. No, wait, that's not right. Wait, C3H7O would be: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. Total 69. Not 45.

Hmm. Maybe it's a different approach. Let's think of the molecular formula of the unknown as C6H10O2. What would be a possible structure? Maybe a diester? Or a ketone and an ester group? Or perhaps a hemiacetal.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a beta-keto ester. For example, ethyl acetoacetate is a beta-keto ester with the formula C5H8O2. But our option C is C6H10O2. So perhaps a larger version.

Wait, another idea: the fragment at 45 could correspond to the (CH3)2CHO+ ion. Let me calculate that. (CH3)2CHO has molecular weight: (2*CH3) is 2*(15)=30, plus CHO is 12+1+16=29. Wait, that sums to 30+29=59? No. Alternatively, (CH2)2CHO would be 24 (for two CH2 groups) + CHO (29) =53. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's go back to the options.

The presence of both a carbonyl and a double bond, plus an O-H group, points towards a structure with these features.

Option C: C6H10O2.

For example, consider a compound like cyclohexene with a ketone and an alcohol group. But wait, that would require more oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe a structure like methyl cyclohex-2-en-1-yl ketone with a hydroxyl group. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: think of the possible functional groups.

The O-H in IR suggests an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The broad peak could be either, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak, perhaps around 2500-3300 cm^-1 with a strong absorption. But the peak here is at 3000, which is a bit lower than typical for alcohols. Hmm, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the 1700 cm^-1 would be the carbonyl from the -COOH group. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond. So the structure could be a substituted acrylic acid. Let's say something like CH2CHCOOH (but that's H2C=CHCOOH). Let's check the formula: that would be C3H4O2. But our options are for C6HxOy.

Alternatively, perhaps a bicyclic structure with a carbonyl and a double bond.

Another thought: the mass spectrum's m/z=45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10=10 +32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114. Breaking down, perhaps losing a fragment that leaves 45.

So 114 -45=69. What could that be? 69 could be something like C4H9O or another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group (which is 44, but close to 45). Not quite matching.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2CH2O) group, but again, not exactly 45.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the cleavage of the ester group. For example, if there's an ester, the RCOOR' could break into RCOO+ (which would be m/z=45 if RCOO is, say, propanoate (CH2CH2COO would be 73). No, that's not matching. Wait, maybe a smaller group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about another angle.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the structure has a double bond. The FT
