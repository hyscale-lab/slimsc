Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is a bit complex, but I'll go through it step by step.

First, the problem describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y, which produces gas W, precipitate G, and another product B. There's some information about the atomic masses and isotopes involved. Let's break it down.

The first part says that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X is probably a compound, and one of its elements has an isotope that's heavier than the usual. Maybe something like Cl-35 vs Cl-37?

When X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is probably something like H2O, NH3, CO2? Wait, no—same number of neutrons and protons in the molecule. Let me think: If the molecule has, say, 2 H and O, then H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Wait, wait, but the molecule's total would be the sum. Or perhaps the molecule itself is an element with equal protons and neutrons. Oh, maybe it's something like CO where C has 6 protons and 8 neutrons (but that's not a stable isotope). Hmm, maybe the molecule is something like CH4? No, wait, the molecule's total protons and neutrons would be the same. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, maybe W is a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. For example, nitrogen has 7 protons and usually 7 neutrons (so 14N). So if W is N2 gas, each molecule would have 28 protons and 28 neutrons. That fits the condition: same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Or maybe it's carbon-12, but that's an atom, not a molecule. Wait, but the gas is released, so it's likely a diatomic molecule. Oh, maybe H2 (each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but that doesn't fit because H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons—so not equal). Or maybe CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, 8 neutrons (in C-12, 6 each, but wait, 12C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So if the molecule is CO2, each carbon is 12, each oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each CO2 molecule would have (6+16) protons and (6+16) neutrons. So 22 each. Yeah, that could fit.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y, a liquid, to give W gas, G precipitate, which upon heating gives B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C, which is close to the melting point of water (0°C) but wait, another thought: 277 K is about 4°C, but perhaps it's another substance. Alternatively, maybe it's another compound. Let me think of possible substances.

Wait, what's the melting point of something around 277 K? Let's see, water is 273 K (0°C). 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm, maybe it's not water. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Let me think of other substances. For example, maybe B is a metal that's solid at that temperature. Alternatively, perhaps B is ammonium chloride? No, I think I'm getting off track. Let's think about the other parts.

The product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Maybe the reaction is some kind of esterification or something else. If X is a base, perhaps it's reacting with the acid to form an ester and water. But I'm not sure.

Now, the substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So, common reagents—maybe something like NaOH, KOH, or NH3? But wait, X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps it's something where isotopic substitution is common. For example, heavy water has D (deuterium) instead of H. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Wait, when X reacts with Y, a liquid, perhaps Y is water. If X is a metal, reacting with water could produce H2 gas. Let me think: metals like Na, K, Ca, etc., react with water to produce hydrogen gas. So, if W is H2, then each H2 molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit the condition where the number of protons and neutrons are the same in the molecule. So W can't be H2 in that case. Hmm.

Alternative approach: what if W is CO2? So, each molecule has 22 protons (12 from C, 16 from O) and 22 neutrons (6 from C, 16 from O), assuming C-12 and O-16. So 22 each. That would fit the condition. So W is CO2.

So if X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce CO2, then perhaps X is a carbonate or a bicarbonate. Or maybe Y is an acid.

Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like NaOH, which can react with acids. If X is NaOH, then reacting with an acid Y (like HCl) would produce NaCl, water, and CO2? No, wait, NaOH plus HCl would produce NaCl and water, but not CO2. Hmm, maybe Y is carbonated, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like potassium permanganate, but that's more for oxidation reactions.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So G could be a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and the oxide of the metal. For example, CaCO3 when heated gives CaO and CO2. But then, B would be CaO, which has a high melting point, not near 277 K.

Wait, if B's melting point is around 277 K, which is about 4°C. Hmm, that's pretty low. So maybe B is something like ammonium chloride? Wait, no, its melting point is around 334 K (60°C). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think again.

Wait, what other compounds have melting points near 277 K? Maybe something like camphor? No, that's more like a crystallization point. Alternatively, perhaps B is a type of salt. Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me think about the other part: the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), and when it reacts with X, perhaps in an esterification reaction, the product is an ester. Wait, but the product would have more oxygen than the acid. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a neutralization, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible elements in X. Since X incorporates a heavier isotope, perhaps it's something like chlorine-35 vs 37, or something like that. Let's say it's Cl. So X could be NaCl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a sodium isotope. No, more likely it's a compound. Let's think about the properties again.

Wait, the reaction produces a precipitate. So maybe Y is a solution, and X is a metal reacting to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is a nitrate solution and X is a metal that forms an insoluble hydroxide upon reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. So G could be a carbonate, which would decompose to CO2 and a metal oxide. Or perhaps it's a hydroxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe G is a bicarbonate, but heating those usually releases CO2 and forms the oxide.

But if W is CO2, then perhaps X is a carbonate. So when X (a carbonate) reacts with Y (maybe an acid), it produces CO2, precipitate, perhaps a sulfate or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate, then X + Y → CO2 + salt (precipitate) + water. For example, CaCO3 + HCl → CO2↑ + CaCl2 + H2O. But in this case, the precipitate would be CaCl2, which is soluble. Hmm, not a precipitate. So perhaps Y is not an acid but a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal nitrate, and X is a more reactive metal, causing a displacement reaction. But then W would be H2 if Y is an acid, but that doesn't fit the earlier condition.

Wait, maybe Y is a base. If X is an acid and Y is a base, they could react to form a salt and water. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a silver salt, and X is a halide, but that's more for precipitation reactions.

Wait, let me think about the product with a keto acid. If the product has 2 oxygen atoms, perhaps it's an ester. For example, if X is an alcohol, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, then the ester would have more oxygen. Let me count: acetic acid is CH3COOH, which has two O in the COOH group. Reacting with an alcohol (like ethanol) would produce an ester (like ethyl acetate) and water. The ester would have more oxygen, but wait, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe the product is a different compound. Alternatively, maybe X is an alkyne or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ether. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is an acid anhydride, but that's a stretch.

Another angle: since the melting point of B is near 277 K, let's think of substances that melt around there. For example, water melts at 273 K (0°C), which is very close. So maybe B is water. But that's at 273 K. But the question says 277 K, which is a bit higher. Hmm, that's almost the same as water's melting point. So perhaps B is water.

Wait, but if B is water, then when G is heated, it releases water. So perhaps G is a hydrate. For example, a copper sulfate pentahydrate would lose water upon heating. But then, G would be the hydrate, and heating it would release H2O, which is B. Then, X would be involved in that process, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but G is a precipitate, so perhaps it's a copper hydroxide, which upon heating would decompose into copper oxide and water. But copper hydroxide's melting point is higher than that.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate and upon heating, it decomposes into CO2 and B (a metal oxide). But then B's melting point would be higher than 277 K.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach this systematically.

Let me list what I know:

1. X reacts with Y (liquid) → W (gas, same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule) + G (precipitate) + B (product upon heating G, melting point ~277 K).

2. X is a reagent in organic chemistry, incorporates a heavier isotope.

3. When a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms.

4. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are to be found (summing all heavier and lighter isotopes).

So, let's think of possible elements in X.

If X is a compound used in organic chemistry, possible candidates are:

- NaOH (used in various reactions)
- K (potassium)
- NH3 (but is a gas)
- Maybe something like THF (a solvent, but not sure).
- Oh, wait, maybe X is a Grignard reagent? No, Grignard is Mg-based, but that's not a common constituent for isotopic substitution.

Wait, another thought: if X is a heavy water isotope, perhaps it's deuterated. But heavy water is D2O, but perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another angle: the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule.

If W is CO, each molecule has 1 C (6p,6n) and 1 O (8p,8n), so total protons:14, total neutrons:14. So 14 each. That fits.

So W is CO.

So, X + Y → CO + G + B.

Wait, but CO is a gas. So perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid.

Wait, if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, and Y is an acid, say H2SO4, then the reaction would produce CO2, but that would be W as CO2, not CO. So perhaps that's not right.

Hmm, another possibility: maybe W is CO, but that requires a reaction that produces carbon monoxide. For example, heating a carbonate with a reducing agent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps W is N2O, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe W is CO2, which has 22 protons (12 from C, 16 from O) and 22 neutrons (6 from C, 16 from O). So that fits the condition.

So if W is CO2, then X reacting with Y produces CO2.

So possible reactions: carbonate reacting with an acid to produce CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. But then, the salt (G) would be a precipitate only if it's insoluble.

Wait, for example, CaCO3 (X) reacts with HCl (Y) → CO2 (W) + CaCl2 (G if it's insoluble? No, CaCl2 is soluble. Hmm. So perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide or another anion that, when reacts, forms an insoluble salt.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is a metal that forms a precipitate carbonate. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the precipitate G. When it's heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide (B). So B would be the metal oxide. For example, if G is CaCO3, heating would produce CaO and CO2. CaO's melting point is around 2615 K, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. Heating NaHCO3 produces Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B could be Na2CO3. Hmm, but Na2CO3's melting point is around 854 K.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Let's think of another scenario.

Suppose W is CO. Then what? X and Y reacting to produce CO.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a hydroxide and Y is a carboxylic acid, perhaps they react to produce a salt and water. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. Then, you get CO2, water, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates as G. But in that case, when G is heated, nothing happens because the salt is already decomposed. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, when X (a carbonate) reacts with Y (an acid), producing CO2, water, and a metal hydroxide (which precipitates if it's insoluble). Then, when G (the hydroxide) is heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and water. So B would be the metal oxide, and the water (B?) But then, B would be water, whose melting point is near 277 K. Wait, but in the reaction, water is already produced. So perhaps when G is heated, it releases water (B), which is the same as earlier.

But then, why would heating the precipitate release water again? Maybe because the precipitate is a hydrated salt. For example, copper sulfate pentahydrate, which upon heating loses water.

Wait, so G is a hydrated salt, and upon heating, it releases water (B), which has a melting point of 277 K. So in this scenario, B is H2O. So when G is heated, it becomes anhydrous and releases water.

So X reacts with Y (maybe a base) to produce a hydrated salt (G) and CO2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think of X as a carbonate. Let's say X is CaCO3. Reacting with H3PO4 (an acid), produces CO2, H2O, and Ca(H2PO4)2. But I'm not sure if that precipitates.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate that reacts with an acid
