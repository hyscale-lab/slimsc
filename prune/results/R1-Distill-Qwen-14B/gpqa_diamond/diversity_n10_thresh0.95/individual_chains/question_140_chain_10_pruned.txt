Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the problem starts with substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

First, I need to identify what each of these substances could be.

Let's break it down. Let's think about possible reactions where a substance reacts with a liquid to produce a gas. A common violent reaction is between metals and acids, like sodium reacting with water to produce hydrogen gas. Wait, but in that case, gas would be H2, which has same number of protons and neutrons (each H has 1, but depends on isotope). But maybe another possibility.

Wait, another possibility is a reaction between a metal and a liquid like water or maybe an acid. Alternatively, could it be a reaction between a metal and a salt solution, causing a precipitate.

The gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, each atom in W has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Maybe CO2? No, because C has 6 protons, O has 8. Wait, W is a molecule, so each atom in the molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons? Or the molecule as a whole? Wait, the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So total protons equal total neutrons in the molecule.

Wait, another interpretation: each molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, if W is H2O, each molecule has 2 H (each has 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2 + 8 =10. Neutrons: 0*2 +8=8. Not equal. So that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe W is NH3? No, that's a liquid. Wait, what about H2? Each H has 1 proton. So molecule has 2, so 2 protons. But H doesn't have any neutrons, so 0. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe CO2? Let me calculate. CO2 has one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons in C-12, but wait, in heavier isotopes, it might have more. But the molecule as a whole: wait, the question says the gas's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for CO2, each C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's C-12). Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if O-16). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Total neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. So 22 each. So that fits. So W is CO2? Or maybe CH4? Let's see, CH4: C has 6, each H has 1. So protons: 6 +4=10. Neutrons: 6 (if C-12) +0=6. Not equal.

Wait, but wait, the problem states W is a gas, and in a violent reaction. So maybe H2? But that doesn't fit the neutron and proton count. Alternatively, maybe O2? O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons (if O-16). So each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, two atoms make 16 each. So O2: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So that works. So W could be O2? But O2 is a diatomic gas, but is it produced in such a reaction?

Alternatively, maybe it's another gas. Let's think about the reaction. If X is a metal reacting with a liquid, maybe Y is water. If X is a metal, and it reacts with water to produce H2 gas. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So protons (2) not equal to neutrons (0). So that doesn't fit.

Wait another possibility: if X is a metal reacting with a strong acid, like sulfuric acid. Wait, but the reaction of metals with acids usually produce H2 gas. Let's see, but H2 doesn't match the neutron and proton count. So maybe the gas is something else.

Wait, maybe the gas is carbon dioxide. How would that happen? If X is a carbonate reacting with something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a solution, say, sodium reacting with water, producing H2. But that doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. What substance has a melting point around there? Maybe water? But water melts at 273 K, which is 0°C. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees. Hmm. So B is something that melts around there.

But if G, when heated, releases B, perhaps G is a carbonate that decomposes to CO2 and a metal oxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, melting point 277 K, so close to 0 degrees. Maybe B is a solid that's just about to melt at normal room temperature, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Wait, if G is a precipitate, maybe it's a carbonate or hydroxide. Let's think: if X is a metal and Y is an acid, then the reaction might produce a salt, which could precipitate.

Wait, the reaction of X with Y could be a double displacement reaction. For example, if X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid, producing CO2 gas, a metal salt, and water. So in that case, W would be CO2, which as I calculated earlier, would have same protons and neutrons.

So, W is CO2. Then, the precipitate G would be the metal salt. For example, if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacting with sulfuric acid (H2SO4), the reaction would produce CO2, sodium sulfate, and water. Sodium sulfate is soluble, but some metal carbonates reacting with acids produce insoluble salts, which precipitate.

Wait, perhaps if Y is a solution of a metal nitrate, and X is a more reactive metal, causing a displacement reaction. For example, iron reacting with a copper nitrate solution, producing copper metal and iron nitrate. But I'm not sure if that fits all the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe X is an alkali metal, like sodium, reacting with a liquid Y which is water. But that might produce H2. Hmm.

Wait, the product of a keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let's see, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid. If this reacts with X, which maybe is a base or something else, and the product has two oxygen atoms. Wait, this part is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, the product could be a salt where the acid loses a proton. But I'm not sure yet.

Another angle: the substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, NaHCO3, etc. Wait, but X incorporates a heavier isotope, so perhaps it's a carbon-containing compound where carbon is a heavier isotope, like C-13 or C-14.

Wait, but X reacts with Y to produce CO2. So X might be a carbonate. Let's think about Sodium Carbonate (Na2CO3). If X is Na2CO3, then when it reacts with an acid (Y), it produces CO2 (gas W), Na salt, and water. The precipitate G could be a metal hydroxide if the acid is strong and the salt is insoluble.

Wait, for example, if Y is HCl, a strong acid, and X is Na2CO3. The reaction would produce NaCl, CO2, and H2O. But NaCl is soluble, so that wouldn't form a precipitate. Alternatively, if Y is a solution of AgNO3, then X as Na2CO3 would react to give Ag2CO3, but I'm not sure if that's soluble.

Wait, perhaps X is not a carbonate. Maybe it's a hydroxide. Let's think about another reaction. If X is a metal hydroxide, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce water and a salt. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, X could be a bicarbonate. Let's say X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Reacting with HCl
