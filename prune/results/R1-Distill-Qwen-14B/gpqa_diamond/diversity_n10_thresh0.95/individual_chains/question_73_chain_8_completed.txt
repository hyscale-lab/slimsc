Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. So for the relative speed, I can't just subtract 0.6c and 0.5c. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. Let me recall. Oh yeah, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, but what's the frame here? Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be from the perspective of one astronaut to the other. So I think I need to calculate the velocity of one as seen from the other's frame.

Let me think. If I'm the first astronaut moving at 0.6c, and the second is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from my frame, the second astronaut is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c? No, wait, that's the classical approach, but relativity doesn't work that way. So I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, no. The formula is when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction, the relative velocity is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). So for u = 0.6c, and v =0.5c, let's plug in: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative velocity v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c → approximately 0.14c. That seems right. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that narrows it down.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so their energies would be gamma*m*c² each. But wait, wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." Oh, but in relativity, energy is frame-dependent. Hmm, wait, but the system here is the two astronauts moving. Do I consider their energies in their rest frames or in some other frame?

Wait, the question says "the total energy of the system." Hmm. Since the astronauts are moving relative to each other, but if we're considering their energies in the same frame, perhaps the rest frame where they are moving. Wait, but which frame? Or is the system's energy calculated in the same frame as the question is given?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the frame. Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy as measured in the rest frame of the combined system, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps each astronaut's energy is calculated in the same frame, like the lab frame, but the problem doesn't specify any frame. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: The problem gives each astronaut's speed in the positive x-direction, but doesn't specify the frame. So perhaps the total energy is the sum of their individual energies as measured in the same frame (maybe the rest frame of the combined system? Or the lab frame? Hmm.)

Wait, but without knowing which frame is the lab, perhaps the problem is considering each astronaut's rest frame. Or maybe the problem is considering the rest frame of the combined system, which would require calculating the total momentum and then finding the energy. But that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each astronaut's energy is calculated in the same inertial frame, say the one where the problem is presented, and then the total energy is just the sum.

Wait, but the problem says "the total energy of the system." If the system is two objects, then in the frame where the problem is phrased (like the lab frame where both are moving), the total energy would be the sum of their energies in that frame.

Wait, but the options give E as mc^2, 4.96 mc^2, 5.96 mc^2, and 5 mc^2.

Let me calculate each astronaut's energy in the lab frame. Wait, but the lab frame is perhaps the frame where the astronauts are moving. Oh, but the problem doesn't specify a particular frame, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the total energy in the center of momentum frame or the rest frame of the combined system. Hmm, that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to compute the sum of their rest energies, but that would be (2m + 3m)c² = 5mc². But looking at the options, option D has E=5mc^2. But the relative speed we calculated is about 0.14c, which matches options C and D.

Wait, but if the total energy is the sum of their rest energies, that's 2m c² + 3m c² = 5 m c². So that's 5 mc², so option D's E is 5 mc². But that can't be right, because their kinetic energies would also contribute. Unless the question is only considering rest mass energy.

Wait, but the problem says "the total energy of the system." In the rest frame of the system, the total energy would be the sum of their rest energies plus any kinetic energy, but that's more complicated. But perhaps the question is considering each astronaut's rest mass energy, but that doesn't seem right because their speeds are relativistic.

Wait, no, actually, if we are in the rest frame of each astronaut, their energy would be just their rest mass energy. But when considering the system's rest frame, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again.

The question says the astronauts are traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So perhaps the frame is the same for both, so their individual energies are calculated in that frame and then summed.

Wait, let's calculate the total energy as the sum of their individual relativistic energies.

So, for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c:

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The gamma is 1.25, the mass is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly for the second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c, which matches our earlier calculation.

So the correct option would be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction with speeds \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). The relative speed between them is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching the Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( 0.14c \).
- The total energy of the system is \( 5.96m c^2 \).

These match the values in **Option C**.
