--- Full Content ---
Okay, I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Let's see what the question says. So, we have a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find what momentum a photon must have so that the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, the given data includes the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s. The options are all about the momentum p in N*s units.

Wait, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, transitions can involve changes in both vibrational and rotational energy levels. But since the question is about the next lowest state, I think it's referring to the next energy level that's higher than the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state or both.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state. That usually means the vibrational quantum number is at its lowest, which is n=0. So if it's the fundamental state, it's the first energy level. When it absorbs a photon, it can transition to the next higher energy state. But the next state could be either the first vibrational excited state (n=1) or a rotationally excited state (like a higher rotational quantum number).

But wait, the question specifies that the molecule should switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy transition would be the smallest possible energy increase. So perhaps the transition is purely vibrational, from n=0 to n=1, because the vibrational energy spacing is larger than the rotational spacing, but I'm not sure. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, wait. Let me think. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. Vibrational energy levels are quantized as well. The total energy is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies. If the molecule is in the fundamental state, that would mean it's in the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational state or rotational state, or both. But the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one where the energy increase is minimal. So which transition gives the smaller energy jump?

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w_vib, where w_vib is the angular frequency of vibration. The spacing between adjacent vibrational levels is h w_vib. For rotational energy, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The spacing between adjacent rotational levels increases with J, but for the transition from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is 2B (since J=0 to J=1 would be E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B(2) - 0 = 2B). 

So the question is, which is smaller: the energy difference for a vibrational transition (from n=0 to n=1, which is h w_vib) or the energy difference for a rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1, which is 2B)?

I think that the vibrational energy spacing is generally larger than the rotational spacing. For example, for many diatomic molecules, the vibrational frequencies are in the range of 1e13 to 1e14 Hz, whereas rotational frequencies are much lower. So if the given w is 4e14 rad/s, that's about 6.4e12 Hz (since 1 rad/s ≈ 1/(2π) Hz, so 4e14 rad/s ≈ (4e14)/(2π) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz). Wait, no, 4e14 rad/s is actually 4e14 / (2π) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz, which is a high frequency, like in the infrared or visible range, I think. 

But wait, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I is given by μ r², where μ is the reduced mass. So let's calculate that first. 

The reduced mass μ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y). Given m_X is 20 amu, m_Y is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but in kg, since amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2 * 1e-10 meters = 2e-10 m.

So the moment of inertia I = μ r² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

The rotational constant B is given by ħ² / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is h/(2π). Wait, let me get the formula right. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2 I). So B = (h/(2π))² / (2 I) = h²/(8 π² I). Alternatively, I think B can also be expressed as (h^2)/(8 π^2 I). 

Wait, perhaps another way. The rotational constant is B = ℏ²/(2 I), where ℏ is h/(2π). So plugging in the numbers: ℏ is about 1.0545718e-34 J s. So ℏ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s². Then, 2I is 2*(1.204e-46) = 2.408e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.408e-46) ≈ 4.617e-23 J. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because units-wise, J is kg m²/s². Let me double-check the formula. Rotational constant B has units of J/(s²) or energy divided by angular momentum squared. Wait, B is in Joules when J is an integer. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of wavenumbers, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute B in terms of energy. The rotational constant B in terms of energy is (h²)/(8 π² I). So let's calculate that. 

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. So h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² is about 78.96, so 4.39e-67 / 78.96 ≈ 5.56e-69. Then, divide by I (1.204e-46 kg m²) gives B ≈ 5.56e-69 / 1.204e-46 ≈ 4.62e-23 J. So B is approximately 4.62e-23 J.

Wait, but what about the energy transition for rotation? The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E(1) - E(0) = B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B ≈ 9.24e-23 J.

The vibrational energy transition from n=0 to n=1 is ΔE_vib = h w_vib. Given w is 4e14 rad/s, so ΔE_vib = h * w = 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s. Wait, rad is dimensionless, so the unit is J. So 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition energy is about 9.24e-23 J, and the vibrational transition is 2.65e-19 J. That's a big difference. So the rotational transition is much lower in energy than the vibrational one. So the photon needed for the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the rotational one.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. Fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the (n=0, J=0) state. So the next possible state would be either (n=1, J=0) or (n=0, J=1), whichever is lower in energy.

Wait, let's compute which transition requires less energy. The energy for n=0, J=0 is E0 = (1/2) h w + 0.

If the molecule transitions to n=1, J=0: E = (3/2) h w + 0. So the energy difference is h w.

Alternatively, transitioning to n=0, J=1: E = (1/2) h w + B (1)(2) = (1/2) h w + 2B. The energy difference here is 2B.

So which is smaller: h w or 2B?

Given that h w is 2.65e-19 J and 2B is about 9.24e-23 J, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon with energy 9.24e-23 J will cause a transition to the next state with the lowest energy.

But wait, the question is about momentum, not energy. Because the photon's momentum is related to its energy. So once we know the energy of the photon, we can find the momentum.

The energy of the photon is E_photon = ΔE. The momentum p_photon is E_photon / c, since for photons, E = pc. Because for photons, E = h f = (h c)/λ, and p = h/(λ) = E/c.

So, p = E/(c) = ΔE / (3e8 m/s).

So, for the rotational transition, ΔE is 2B ≈ 9.24e-23 J.

Thus, p = 9.24e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.24e-23) / (3e8) N s.

Let me compute that: 9.24e-23 / 3e8 = 3.08e-31 N s. Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them are that small. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe I'm confusing the selection rules for vibrational and rotational transitions. In the rigid rotor model, the selection rule for rotational transitions is ΔJ = ±1. But in the non-rigid rotor, maybe things are a bit different. Or perhaps the question is considering only vibrational transitions because that's the more common scenario when dealing with the quantum rotation-vibration model for a transition.

Wait, but the question says the model is the non-rigid rotor, so perhaps it's allowing for both vibrational and rotational transitions. But the question is about what photon momentum would cause the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the rotational transition is lower in energy than the vibrational, then that's the one we need.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, the rotational transition's ΔE is 9.24e-23 J and the vibrational is 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recalculate B.

So, B = (h²)/(8 π² I).

Given h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² ≈ 78.96.

I = μ r² = ( (20 * 2)/(20+2) ) * (2e-10 m)^2 amu converted to kg.

Wait, wait, no. I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me recompute μ.

μ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y), where m_X is 20 amu, m_Y is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

So B = (h²)/(8 π² I) = ( (6.626e-34)^2 ) / (8 * π² * 1.206e-46 )

Compute denominator first: 8 * π² ≈ 78.96, so 78.96 * 1.206e-46 ≈ 9.53e-45.

Numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

So B ≈ 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45 ≈ 4.605e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Which is correct as before. So the rotational transition requires about 9.21e-23 J.

But the photon's momentum p is E/c, so that's 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm, I'm getting a much smaller p than any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition that allows both vibrational and rotational changes. So perhaps the next state is a combination of both. Wait, but the problem states to find the photon that enables the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal possible energy transition.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the Raman transition, where the photon induces a change in both rotational and vibrational states. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the selection rules for vibrational transitions in diatomic molecules usually allow for rotational changes as well. For example, in vibrational transitions, the rotational quantum number can change by ±1. So the transition could be from (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=1), which would involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But that would require more energy than a pure vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the fundamental vibrational transition, which is purely vibrational. But then, the energy would be h w. But in that case, the photon's momentum is h w / c.

Wait, let's compute that.

h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is smaller, but option A is 1.9e-28. So 8.8e-28 is larger than option A.

But wait, none of the options match that. So maybe the correct approach is to think that the molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, which allows for changes in bond length. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that affects the transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one where the energy difference is the smallest.

So we need to compute both possibilities:

1. v=0 → v=1, J remains 0. Energy change is h w.

2. J=0 → J=1, v remains 0. Energy change is 2 B.

Which is smaller? As before, 2B is 9.2e-23 J, and h w is 2.65e-19 J. So 2B is smaller. So the photon's energy would be 2B, and its momentum is 2B/c.

Wait, but 2B is about 9.2e-23 J. Let's compute p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 N s. But this is way smaller than the options given, which are about 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1 in the rotational model, but for a diatomic, the rotational energy levels are quantized and the selection rules allow ΔJ=±1.

Wait, another thought: the question might be mixing up the rotational and vibrational contributions. Or perhaps the correct approach is to model the transition as a change in both vibrational and rotational state, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is about the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be the combination of v=0, J=1, which would require a rotational transition. So the energy change is 2B.

But according to the numbers, that's 9.2e-23 J, and p = 3.07e-31 N s, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for B. Let me check another formula for B. I recall that B is also given by (h c B̃ ) where B̄ is the rotational constant in cm^-1. But without knowing B̄, maybe another approach is to compute B based on the bond length and reduced mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the molecule as a rigid rotor, but the question says non-rigid, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the energy calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the energy for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. The energy for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is h w. The problem is asking for the photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which is smaller, 2B or h w?

From earlier calculation, 2B is 9.2e-23 J, and h w is 2.65e-19 J. So 2B is about 4 orders of magnitude smaller. So the rotational transition requires a lower energy photon.

But the photon's momentum is E/c. So 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 N s. None of the options match this. So perhaps the problem expects the transition to be a vibrational one.

Wait, but why? Because maybe the rotational transition isn't allowed, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.

Wait, another angle: perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational and rotational energies are treated together, and the possible transitions are considered where both change. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'fundamental state' refers to the lowest vibrational state, and the next state is the first vibrational excited state, regardless of rotation. So the photon would have energy h w.

In that case, p = E/c = (h w)/c = (6.626e-34 * 4e14) / 3e8.

Let's compute that:

6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Divide by 3e8: 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.835e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. Hmm, 8.8e-28 isn't listed. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the transition from v=0 to v=1 requires a photon of energy h w, but the absorption might involve a change in rotational state as well. But in that case, the energy would be higher. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the transition as a pure vibrational one, and the given options have a miscalculation. But that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=0, J=1) state, which is a rotational transition. So the energy change is 2B, as before.

But 2B is 9.2e-23 J, so p is 3.07e-31 N s. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually referring to a change in the vibrational state only. But with p=8.8e-28 N s, which isn't any of the options. So maybe I'm missing a factor of 2, perhaps because the photon's energy is (n+1/2)hw, but no, the transition is n=0 to n=1, so ΔE = hw.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in converting the units. Let me recheck.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

w = 4e14 rad/s.

So h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / (3e8) = 8.83e-28 N s.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to that. The options are much larger. So perhaps the problem is considering a different type of transition.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem is considering the change in the rotational state with a vibrational quantum number change. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the vibrational transition, but I'm using the wrong formula for the photon's momentum. Wait, photons have energy E = h f and momentum p = E/c = h f /c = h/(lambda). But since f = w/(2 pi), E = h * w/(2 pi) * 2 pi = h w.

Wait, that's correct. So I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the given options are incorrect, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the rotational transition, but the given options are for a much larger energy. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me recompute B.

B = h²/(8 π² I).

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (8 * π² * 1.206e-46 )).

Compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 78.96. 78.96 * 1.206e-46 = 9.53e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45 = approx 4.605e-23 J, as before.

So 2B is about 9.21e-23 J.

p_photon = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 N s.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which includes both vibrational and rotational ground states. The next state is the next vibrational state, which is higher in energy than the next rotational state. But according to the numbers, that would require a photon with momentum ~8.8e-28 N s, which isn't an option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm, 8.8e-28 is closest to option A (1.9e-28), but it's about four times larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 4 somewhere.

Wait, wait. Oh! Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. Maybe the fundamental state refers to the state with the lowest possible rotational and vibrational energy, but perhaps the next state is a higher vibrational state, but that would require a photon with energy h w.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the selection rules. Maybe the molecule can't transition from J=0 to J=1 without a vibrational change. Or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon that causes a transition to the next state where either vibrational or rotational changes occur, but considering the minimal energy. Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, that's the way to go.

But according to the numbers, that's not matching any option. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both. So perhaps the transition involves both a vibrational and a rotational change. The energy difference would then be h w + 2B, but that's even larger, so not the minimal.

Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense. The minimal would have to be the smaller of the two.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the rotational state transition, but I'm miscalculating the momentum. Wait, another angle: the momentum of the photon is p = h / lambda. But lambda is wavelength. Alternatively, since E = h f and p = E/c, then p = h f /c.

But f = w/(2 pi), so p = h w/(2 pi c).

Wait, wait, wait. Oh! I think I made a mistake here. Because w is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is the angular frequency of vibration. So the actual frequency f is w/(2 pi) = 4e14 / (2 pi) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So h w is h * (2 pi f) = 2 pi h f. Which is 2 pi times the photon's energy.

Wait, so the energy E_photon = h f = (h w) / (2 pi).

Because E = h f, and since w = 2 pi f, so f = w/(2 pi), so E = h w/(2 pi).

Ah! So I think I made a mistake earlier by not dividing by 2 pi. Because I thought E = h w, but actually, E = h w/(2 pi), since w is in radians per second.

Wait, let's clarify. The angular frequency w is 2 pi times the frequency f. So f = w/(2 pi). Therefore, E = h f = h w/(2 pi).

So let me recalculate the photon's energy for the vibrational transition:

E_photon_vib = h w/(2 pi) = (6.626e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (2 pi) ≈ (2.65e-19 J) / 6.283 ≈ 4.21e-19 J.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J, which is h w. But since E = h f = h (w/(2 pi)), so E = h w/(2 pi) = 2.65e-19 /6.283 ≈ 4.21e-19 J.

So the photon's momentum p = E/c = 4.21e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 1.403e-27 N s.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.1e-27, option B is 2.3e-27. Hmm, 1.4e-27 is close to option C. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, and the correct momentum is about 1.4e-27 N s, which would match option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is this the case? Oh, because I'm missing that for the rotational transition, the photon's energy is 2B, which is about 9.2e-23 J. That would give p = 3e-31 N s, which isn't an option.

But according to the options, the closest is option C:1.1e-27, which is close to what I just calculated for the vibrational transition (1.4e-27). But why would the vibrational transition be the correct one, since it's a higher energy jump.

This seems confusing. Let me think again.

The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal ΔE would be the rotational transition at 9.2e-23 J. But if the options don't include that, perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about the order of magnitude. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reduced mass is in atomic mass units, which I converted correctly. Let me recheck that.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

B = h²/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 pi^2 *1.206e-46) = (4.39e-67) / (9.53e-45) = approx 4.605e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.21e-23 J.

Photon's momentum for rotational transition: 9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 N s.

No option matches this.

But for the vibrational transition, the correct E is h w/(2 pi) = 4.21e-19 J.

p = 4.21e-19 /3e8 = 1.403e-27 N s. Which is close to option C (1.1e-27) but higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not divide by 2 pi, which would give me E = h w = 2.65e-19 J, and p = 8.83e-28 N s, which is close to option A (1.9e-28), but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the rotational transition, but using a different formula.

Wait, another thought: the rotational energy spacing can also be expressed in terms of the moment of inertia. The rotational constant is B = h/(8 pi² c I), where c is the speed of light? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used rotational energy in terms of wave numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition where both vibrational and rotational states change, but the energy is a sum, and the minimal is a specific combination. But I'm not finding any.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let's look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

If the correct calculation for the vibrational transition gives p ≈ 1.4e-27 N s, then option C is 1.1e-27, which is close. But why would the rotational transition not be the correct one? Because it requires a much smaller momentum. But perhaps the problem is asking for the transition to the next state in terms of the model, which might include both vibrational and rotational changes.

Wait, perhaps the model treats the molecule as a three-dimensional rotor, but that's probably not the case here.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=1, J=0) state, which is a purely vibrational transition. In that case, the energy is h w, and the photon's momentum is h w /c.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, so the transition from n=0 to n=1 is h w. So the photon's energy is h w, and p = h w/(c).

But let's compute that:

h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a quarter of that. Hmm, but I don't see the connection.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, which requires energy 2B, and the photon's momentum is 2B/(c). But 2B is 9.2e-23 J, so p = 3.07e-31 N s, which doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator and ignores rotational transitions, making the photon momentum based on the vibrational frequency.

In that case, the correct p would be (h w)/(c). So 6.626e-34 *4e14 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N s.

But again, the options don't have this.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which suggests that the molecule's energy includes both vibrational and rotational contributions, but the transitions can involve changes in either or both.

In that case, the next possible state after (v=0, J=0) would be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever requires less energy.

From earlier calculations, (v=0, J=1) requires about 9.2e-23 J, and (v=1, J=0) requires 2.65e-19 J. So the minimal is the rotational transition, but its momentum is much smaller than any option.

Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, despite the higher energy, because the question might be expecting that. But why?

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the rotational energy. Let me recheck the formula for B.

B = (h²)/(8 π² I) → yes.

I is correct, right? μ is correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is 2 angstroms, but perhaps it's not converted correctly. r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. Yes.

Wait, perhaps the rotational selection rules require a change in J by ±1, but for the vibrational transition, the rotational state can change by ±1 as well, making the total energy change less than h w. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is an exam-style question where only the vibrational transition is considered, and the rotational is neglected. Thus, the photon's momentum is h w /c, which is 8.83e-28 N s, but the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the photon's momentum is related to angular momentum. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reduced mass is 3.015e-27 kg, and the bond length is 2e-10 m. The moment of inertia I is correct.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is expressed in terms of the rotational wave number, but without knowing the exact formula, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the photon momentum for the vibrational transition, leading to p = 8.83e-28 N s, which isn't an option, but perhaps the closest option is A) 1.9e-28, but that's about 4 times smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum in a different way. Wait, photons have p = h / λ, and since λ = c / f, p = h f / c. So E = h f → p = E/c.

So for the vibrational transition, E = h w/(2 pi) → p = (h w)/(2 pi c) = (6.626e-34 *4e14) / (2 pi *3e8).

Let me compute that.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Denominator: 2 pi *3e8 ≈ 6.283 *3e8 ≈ 1.885e9.

So p = 2.6504e-19 / 1.885e9 ≈ 1.406e-27 N s.

So approximately 1.4e-27 N s, which is close to option C (1.1e-27) and option D is 1.4e-28.

Wait, the calculation for vibrational transition gives p ≈1.4e-27, which is very close to option C (1.1e-27) and no exact match. But perhaps the problem expects this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the rotational transition, leading to p = 3.07e-31 N s, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is expecting the vibrational transition, and the correct answer is around 1.4e-27, which isn't an option, but option C is 1.1e-27, and perhaps the calculation expects that.

But why would that be the case? Maybe I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state, which is the first state with higher energy, regardless of whether it's vibrational or rotational. But the minimal energy transition would be the rotational one, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is expecting the vibrational transition, leading to p ≈ 8.8e-28, which is closest to option A (1.9e-28) but doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct p is 1.4e-27, which would be option C. But option C is 1.1e-27, which is close but not exact.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the rotational transition despite the options not matching.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the photon's momentum is calculated using the angular frequency w without dividing by 2 pi, leading to p = (h w)/(c).

In that case, E = h w, p = h w / c.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 N s, which is about a fourth of this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula p = h bar * k, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as (n + 1/2) h w, but that's for the energy level, not the transition.

Wait, the transition from n=0 to n=1 is ΔE = h w, so the photon's energy is h w, and p = E/c.

Which brings me back to 8.83e-28 N s.

Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is option C (1.1e-27), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the rotational transition, but I'm not getting any option for that.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is using the formula p = m v, but for photons, p = E/c. So I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the rotational energy levels but with a different formula. For example, the rotational energy is E = (J (J+1)) * B, where B is in cm^-1. But without knowing B, perhaps the problem expects another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's moment of inertia for its rotational energy and the vibrational energy, but I'm not sure.

In the end, given the options and my calculations, I think the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 N s, based on the vibrational transition calculation.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the rotational and vibrational energy transitions using the quantum rotation-vibration model.

### Key Information and Calculations:
1. **Masses and Bond Length**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.015 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.015 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
   \]

4. **Rotational Constant**:
   \[
   B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}
   \]
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( I = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \):
   \[
   B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.206 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 4.605 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

5. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition**:
   The energy difference for a transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.605 \times 10^{-23} = 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
   \]
   This value is much smaller than any of the given options.

6. **Energy Difference for Vibrational Transition**:
   The vibrational energy difference for a transition from \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
   \]

7. **Comparison of Options**:
   - **Option A**: \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)
   - **Option B**: \( 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)
   - **Option C**: \( 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)
   - **Option D**: \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)

   The calculated vibrational momentum (\( p_{\text{vib}} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) is closest to **Option A**, but it is approximately four times larger. None of the options match the rotational transition momentum (\( p_{\text{rot}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)).

### Conclusion:
Given the options and the calculations, the vibrational transition is likely the intended scenario. The closest match to the calculated vibrational momentum is **Option C** (\( 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)), though it is not exact.
