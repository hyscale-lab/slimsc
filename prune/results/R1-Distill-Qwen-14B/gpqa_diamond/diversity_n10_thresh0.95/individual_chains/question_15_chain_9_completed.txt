Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to work through it. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll think it out step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, so that's equal between them.

Wait, the orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period P, Planet_1 has P/3. That probably affects the probability of transit, but how?

Also, the host stars are different. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Same radius but different masses. Hmm, that's interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbital plane. But more specifically, for a circular orbit, the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P ≈ (R_planet / R_star)² * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2), but since both orbits are circular, e is zero. So the probability simplifies to (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something else... wait, no, I might be mixing up something.

Wait, another thought: the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a), where a is the semi-major axis. Or wait, is it the other way around? Or perhaps it's another factor. Oh, wait, I think the key factor is the ratio of the planet's orbital size to the star's radius. No, that can't be right.

Wait, the transit probability for a planet is actually given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2)^(1/2))

Wait, I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, I recall that for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability of transit is (R_p + R_s) / a. Or is it (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The transit probability depends on the relative sizes of the planet and star, and the alignment of the orbit. For a circular orbit, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2)^0.5), but wait, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability is roughly (R_p / a) * (R_s + R_p) / R_s. Or maybe (R_p / a)²? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, I think the probability of transit (P) is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2 ) )

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2 ))^{1/2}

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, another approach: the transit occurs only if the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The probability of this alignment is roughly (R_s + R_p) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate.

Wait, I think the standard formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / a)^2 * (1 + (R_p / R_s)) )

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2)) ), but I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look at the relative probabilities for each planet. Let's denote the transit probability for planet i as P_i.

But maybe I should approach this differently, using the fact that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2 * something else.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the formula for the transit probability. The probability of a planet transiting is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(a^2 - R_s^2)))

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / a)^2 * (R_s + R_p) / R_s.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up different factors here. Let me try to recall the correct formula.

Ah, I think I remember the correct formula. The probability that a planet transits its star is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) )

Wait, but this doesn't make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

P = (R_p / a) * (R_s + R_p) / R_s

No, that also doesn't look right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the geometry. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit causes a transit is approximately (R_p / a)^2 * (something). Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2 * (1 / sin i), but since the inclination i is random, the average value would be a factor of 2, leading to P = (R_p / a)^2 * (1/2), but that doesn't seem correct either.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Since the question gives masses of the stars and planets, and their orbital periods, maybe I can compute the semi-major axes using Kepler's third law.

Right, Kepler's third law says that (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_s + M_p)) / (4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So, a^3 ≈ G M_s P² / (4 π²).

So, a is proportional to (M_s P²)^(1/3).

Wait, but how does this relate to the transit probability?

The transit probability depends on the size of the planet's orbit (a) because the bigger the orbit (larger a), the lower the chance of the planet passing in front of the star from our point of view, right? Because a larger orbit means the planet's path around the star is a bigger circle, making it less likely to cross our line of sight. So, a smaller a increases the probability of transit.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis. Because the area of the star's disk is π R_s², and the area that the planet must pass in front of is a much smaller region. The probability increases as a decreases because the planet's orbital plane has a higher chance of intersecting our line of sight.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the formula for the transit probability. I've read somewhere that the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2))) )

But wait, that would have units of 1/(sqrt(1 - (length/length)^2)) ), which is unitless, so that makes sense.

But if a is much larger than R_s (which it usually is), then (R_s/a) is very small, so 1 - (R_s/a)^2 ≈ 1, and so the term becomes ~1. So in that case, P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2.

But wait, that's only if a is much larger than R_s, which is generally the case for exoplanets. So the dominant factor is (R_p/R_s)^2. But wait, in the question, both planets have the same mass. So, R_p is the same for both planets, since mass and radius for Earth-like planets are closely related. So if they're Earth-like, their radii are similar.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have the same masses. So, assuming they're Earth-like, R_p1 ≈ R_p2, so (R_p/R_s) is the same for both planets. But wait, the host stars have the same radius. Because the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_s1 = R_s2. So (R_p/R_s)^2 would be the same for both planets.

Wait, but that's assuming the planets have the same radius. Are we told that both are Earth-like and thus have similar radii?

The question says "Earth-like planets," but I don't know if that implies the same radius. But since they have the same mass, and for Earth-like planets, mass and radius are closely related (density being similar), their radii should be similar. So I can probably assume R_p1 ≈ R_p2.

If that's the case, then (R_p/R_s)^2 would be the same for both planets, so transit probability would depend on the other factor.

Wait, but in the formula I thought of earlier, if a is much larger than R_s, then the probability is approximately (R_p/R_s)^2. But if a is not much larger, then the other term contributes.

Hmm, but wait, the other term in the transit probability formula is the (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2)) factor. So if a is larger, that term approaches 1, and if a is smaller, (R_s/a) increases, making the denominator smaller, so the overall term larger. So that would mean that a smaller a increases the probability beyond just (R_p/R_s)^2.

Wait, but I thought that a larger a decreases the probability. So perhaps I've got the formula wrong.

Let me think again. The transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is smaller because it's more likely to cross the line of sight. So for a planet with a smaller a, the transit probability is higher.

So perhaps the formula is:

P = (R_p / a)² * ... ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. The transit probability can be approximated as:

P ≈ (R_p / a)^2 * (R_s + R_p) / R_s

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps P is approximately (R_p / (a - R_s))².

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Since both planets are Earth-like, same mass, but different orbital periods and host stars.

Wait, the problem gives orbital period and host star mass. Since the planets have already been detected via RV, we know their minimum masses and periods.

So using Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G M_s) (P²) / (4 π²)

So a = [ (G M_s P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But since M_s is in kg, P in seconds, etc., but perhaps I can compare the semi-major axes of the two planets.

Let's denote:

M1 = mass of star 1 = 2 M_s (where M_s is the mass of star 2)
P1 = P / 3 (since period of planet 1 is three times shorter)
So, for planet 1: a1^3 = (G * (2 M_s) * (P/3)^2 ) / (4 π^2)
For planet 2: a2^3 = (G * M_s * P^2 ) / (4 π^2)

So, let's take the ratio a1/a2:

(a1^3)/(a2^3) = [ (2 M_s) (P/3)^2 ) ] / [ M_s P^2 ) ]
= (2) * (P² / 9) / P² ) 
= (2) * (1/9) ) 
= 2/9

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)

Calculating that: 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6 (because 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is close to 0.222). So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So a1 ≈ (2/9)^(1/3) * a2 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

Now, transit probability depends on a and R_p and R_s.

As I'm getting stuck on the exact formula, perhaps I can think in terms of the transit probability being inversely proportional to a.

Because a smaller a would mean a more compact orbit, which is more likely to transit.

But wait, another way: the probability of transit is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, because the cross-sectional area is π R_p^2, and the area of the star's disk is π R_s^2. The probability that the planet's path intersects our line of sight is proportional to the area of the star compared to the planet's orbital area, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the transit probability is often approximated as:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) )

But if R_s << a, then sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 ) ≈ 1, so P ≈ (R_p/R_s)^2.

In that case, since both planets have the same R_p and R_s, their P would be the same. But that can't be right because the options suggest different probabilities.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe because the formula isn't exactly (R_p/R_s)^2. Perhaps it's (R_p / a)^2 * something else.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability (P) can be approximated as (R_p / a)^2 * (R_s / R_p), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've read that the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(a^2 - R_s^2))) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p^2) / (a^2 - R_s^2)

But I'm not confident. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relative transit probabilities between the two planets.

Let me denote the transit probability ratio as P1/P2.

Given that R_p1 = R_p2 (since same mass, Earth-like), and R_s1 = R_s2 (as given), the ratio becomes (something involving a1 and a2).

Assuming that the transit probability is inversely proportional to a^2, because if a is smaller, P is higher. Or perhaps it's proportional to (R_p/a)^2.

So, if P ∝ (R_p / a)^2, then P1/P2 = ( (R_p1/a1) / (R_p2/a2) )^2 = (a2 / a1)^2.

Since a1 is 0.6 a2, (a2/a1) = (1/0.6) ≈ 1.6667.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.6667)^2 ≈ 2.777...

So P1 is approximately 2.77 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, but let's check the transit probability formula again. If P is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, then yes, a smaller a leads to higher P.

But wait, I thought earlier that for a much larger than R_s, P is approximately (R_p/R_s)^2. But if a is not much larger, then perhaps it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a).

No, that can't be because units don't match.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is (R_p / (R_s + a))²? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit. But the planet's orbit is a circle with radius a, so the area is π a². The star's area is π R_s². But the probability of the planet passing in front of the star is the ratio of the star's area to the orbital area, but only if the orbit is edge-on. Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I think the correct formula is that the transit probability is:

P = (R_p + R_s) / a * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) )

Wait, that might be from limb darkening or something else, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I've found in some sources that the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 )) )

But I'm not certain. Let's proceed with that formula for the sake of argument.

So, P = (R_p^2) / (R_s^2) * 1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s^2/a²)).

Given that R_p is same for both planets, and R_s is same, the ratio P1/P2 is:

P1/P2 = [1/sqrt(1 - (R_s^2/a1^2))] / [1/sqrt(1 - (R_s^2/a2^2)))] 

= sqrt( (1 - (R_s^2/a2^2)) / (1 - (R_s^2/a1^2)) )

But since a1 is smaller than a2, R_s/a1 is larger than R_s/a2. So the denominator (1 - (R_s/a1)^2) would be smaller, making the overall sqrt term larger than 1. So P1 > P2.

Wait, but how much larger? Let's compute with numbers.

We have a1 ≈ 0.6 a2. Let's take R_s as R. So:

For a1 = 0.6 a2,

R_s / a1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (R/a2)/0.6 = (R/a2) * (5/3) ≈ 1.6667 (R/a2)

Assuming that a2 is much larger than R_s, so (R/a2) is small. Let's say it's x. So x is R/a2, which is a small number.

Then, 1 - (R_s/a1)^2 = 1 - ( (5/3 x )^2 ) = 1 - (25/9 x² )

Similarly, 1 - (R_s/a2)^2 = 1 - x².

So,

P1/P2 = sqrt( (1 - x²) / (1 - (25/9 x² )) )

Hmm, but if x is small, like x² << 1, then:

1 - x² ≈ 1,

1 - (25/9 x² ) ≈ 1 - (25/9 x² )

So,

P1/P2 ≈ sqrt( 1 / (1 - (25/9 x² )) )

= sqrt( [1] / [1 - (25/9 x²)] )

Which is approximately sqrt( 1 + (25/9 x² ) ), using the approximation 1/(1-ε) ≈ 1 + ε for small ε.

So,

P1/P2 ≈ sqrt(1 + (25/9 x² )) ≈ 1 + (25/(18 x² ))

Wait, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps if x is very small, then the term (25/9 x²) is small, so P1/P2 is approximately 1 plus something small, meaning that the transit probability is slightly higher for Planet_1. But perhaps this effect is small compared to another factor.

Wait, perhaps I should compute a1 and a2 more precisely.

Wait, let's go back to Kepler's third law. Let me compute a1 and a2 accurately.

We have a^3 = (G M_s P² ) / (4 π² )

But since M_s and P are given for each planet, but for Planet_1, M_s1=2 M_s2, and P1 = P2 /3.

Let me write a1^3 = (G * 2 M_s2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = (G * M_s2 * P2^2 ) / (4 π² )

So the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 * (P2^2 /9 )) / (M_s2 P2^2 ) * (4 π² cancels) → (2/9) * (M_s2 P2^2) / (M_s2 P2^2) ) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

The cube root of 2/9 is approximately cube root of 0.222. Let's compute it.

Cube of 0.6 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is 0.6 times a2.

Now, going back to the transit probability formula.

Assume that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a).

Wait, that would make sense if a is the semi-major axis. Because then, a smaller a increases the probability.

So for Planet_1: P1 ≈ (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/a1)
For Planet_2: P2 ≈ (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/a2)

Thus, P1/P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) = a2/a1 = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So P1 is about 1.6667 times higher than P2.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times.

Hmm, wait, why did I think it was 1.66? Because a2/a1 is 1/0.6 = 1.666... So P1 is 1.666... times P2.

Which is approximately 1.67 times, so option C says "1.65 times higher", which is close.

Wait, but why would the transit probability be inversely proportional to a? Because if a is small, the orbital area is smaller, so the chances of the planet passing in front are higher. So yes, P ≈ (R_p^2/R_s^2) * (1/a), since a is in the denominator.

So, with that, the probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of a2/a1 = 1.666..., so about 1.67 times.

Looking at the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

Option D) ... 2.7 times.

So the correct choice would be C.

But wait, earlier I thought that the transit probability also depends on the term (1 - (R_s/a)^2) in the denominator. But if a is much larger than R_s, which it is for exoplanets, this term is approximately 1, so the P ≈ (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/a).

In that case, the calculation holds, and the ratio is (a2/a1) = 1.666..., which is approximately 1.67, so the correct option would be C.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a)^2. Wait, that would be (R_p^2 R_s^2)/(R_s^2 a^2) )= (R_p^2)/(a^2). Then the ratio P1/P2 would be (a2² / a1² ) → (a2/a1)^2 = (1.6667)^2 ≈ 2.777.

Which would correspond to option D, 2.7 times.

Wait, but that can't be right if the formula is (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a)^2.

Hmm, I'm getting confused again. Let me think. If the transit probability is proportional to (R_p/a)^2, then with a1 = 0.6 a2, (a2/a1) = 1.666… So (R_p/a1)^2 / (R_p/a2)^2 = (a2²)/(a1² ) = (1.666…)^2 ≈ 2.777. Which would make P1 higher by 2.77 times.

But earlier I thought that the formula is (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/a), leading to P1 being 1.66 times P2.

Hmm, perhaps I should refer to the correct transit probability formula.

After a quick search in my memory, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 )) )

But when a >> R_s, this simplifies to (R_p/R_s)^2.

So if a is not much larger than R_s, the term (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 )) increases.

But in the case of exoplanets, a is generally much larger than R_s, so the simplification holds, and the probability is approximately (R_p/R_s)^2.

But in this question, a1 is 0.6 a2, and a2 is, say, much larger than R_s.

Wait, but if a1 is smaller, but still a>>R_s, then (R_s/a1) is larger than (R_s/a2), so the term (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 )) would be slightly larger for a1 than a2.

But in that case, the difference between the probabilities would be small because a is much larger than R_s for both. So perhaps the main factor is (R_p/R_s)^2, which is same for both, so the transit probabilities are the same.

But that contradicts the options given, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps the transit probability isn't just (R_p/R_s)^2. Because even if a is much larger, the actual formula depends on a in another way.

I found in some sources that the transit probability is:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a) * (R_s + R_p) / R_p

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is:

P = (R_p^2) / (a^2 - R_s^2)

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

P = (R_p / a)^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / R_s )

Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I've found that the transit probability is approximately:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sin i)) )

But the average over all inclinations is considered, so the probability for a random inclination is (1 / 2) * (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, but that would make the transit probability the same for both planets, which doesn't align with the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the star's size and the planet's orbital distance. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned to pass in front of the star is proportional to (R_p / a)^2. Because the cross-section for transit is π R_p^2, and the total area of the sky is π a^2, but only when projected along our line of sight.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right.

Alternatively, the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough to cause a transit is given by (R_p / (a)) / (something else).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the area of the star's disk compared to the area of the planet's orbit. The probability of the planet's path intersecting our line of sight is (R_s + R_p) / a, but this is a simplification.

Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up impact parameters and probabilities. The impact parameter is the distance from the star's center to the planet's path at the time of transit. If the impact parameter is less than (R_s + R_p), then a transit occurs.

But in terms of probability, assuming random orientation, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is proportional to (R_p / a)^2.

So perhaps P ≈ (R_p/a)^2 * something. If that's the case, then for Planet_1, a is smaller, so (R_p/a) is larger, leading to a higher probability.

So, with a1 = 0.6 a2, (R_p/a1) = 1/(0.6 a2) R_p = (1.6667)(R_p/a2), so (R_p/a1)^2 = (2.7778)(R_p/a2)^2.

Thus, P1 = (R_p/a1)^2 * k, P2 = (R_p/a2)^2 * k, so P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 = (1/0.6)^2 = approx 2.78.

Which matches option D, which says 2.7 times higher.

But in this case, the transit probability would be proportional to (R_p/a)^2.

But earlier, I thought that when a >> R_s, the probability was (R_p/R_s)^2. But according to this, it's (R_p/a)^2.

I'm getting conflicting approaches, so I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the transit probability as:

P = (R_p + R_s) / a * (1 / (sqrt(a^2 - R_s^2 )) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by (something involving R_s and a).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the transit probability is higher when the star is larger. But in this case, both stars have the same radius, so that cancels out.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the main factors.

The probability of transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital size. The closer the planet is to the star (smaller a), the higher the probability of transit. So Planet_1, with a shorter period, is closer to its star, so it has a higher probability.

But how much higher? Let's think about the semi-major axes. We found a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈0.6 a2.

Assuming that the transit probability is proportional to (1/a), then P1/P2 = a2/a1 ≈1.666... So 1.67 times.

Which is close to option C's 1.65.

Alternatively, if the probability is proportional to (1/a^2), then P1/P2=(a2/a1)^2≈ 2.77, which is option D.

But without knowing the exact formula, it's tricky. But the question provides that the researchers have chosen to observe Planet_1, as per the options C and D.

Another angle: the star's mass affects the semi-major axis. Planet_1 is around a more massive star, which for the same period would have a larger a. Wait, no, in our earlier calculation, Planet_1's period is shorter, and the star is more massive, so a is smaller.

Wait, but given the same period, a more massive star would have a larger a. But in this case, Planet_1 has a shorter period and more massive star, leading to a smaller a.

But perhaps the star's mass affects the transit probability indirectly. But we've accounted for that in our a calculation.

Let me think of another approach. The transit method is more favorable for planets with smaller orbital periods because they transit more frequently, giving more chances to observe a transit. But the question is about the probability of a single transit occurrence, not the frequency.

So, the main factors would be a and R_p, R_s.

But how do these factors enter into the probability formula.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 )) )

Which would mean that for a given a and R_s, the probability depends on this factor. So, for a1 and a2, let's compute the factor.

Compute for each planet:

For Planet_1: (R_s/a1) = R_s/(0.6 a2) = (R_s/a2) * (1/0.6) ≈ 1.6667 (R_s/a2)

For Planet_2: R_s/a2.

Assuming that R_s << a2 (which is true), (R_s/a2)^2 is negligible.

So for Planet_1:

sqrt(1 - (R_s/a1)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.6667 R_s/a2)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - (2.777 R_s²/a2² )) ≈ 1 - (2.777 R_s²)/(2 a2² )

Similarly, for Planet_2:

sqrt(1 - (R_s/a2)^2 ) ≈ 1 - (R_s²)/(2 a2² )

So, 1/sqrt( ... ) ≈ 1 + (something).

So,

P1 ≈ (R_p² / R_s²) * [1 + (1.3885 R_s²/a2² ) ]

P2 ≈ (R_p² / R_s²) * [1 + (0.5 R_s²/a2² ) ]

So the ratio P1/P2 ≈ [1 + 1.3885 x ] / [1 + 0.5 x ], where x = R_s²/a2².

If x is very small, then the ratio is approximately [1 + 1.3885 x ] / [1 + 0.5 x ] ≈ (1.3885 x) / (0.5 x ) = 2.777.

So the ratio P1/P2 is approximately 2.777 times.

So, Planet_1 has a transit probability about 2.7 times higher than Planet_2.

Which corresponds to option D.

But wait, this only holds if the term (R_s/a)^2 is not negligible. But for exoplanets, a is much larger than R_s, so x is very small. So the ratio would be very close to (R_p²/R_s²) * (1/(sqrt(1 - (R_s/a1)^2 )) ) divided by the same for a2.

But according to the calculation, when a is much larger than R_s, the ratio approaches (R_p²/R_s²) * (1/( sqrt(1 - (R_s/a1)^2 )) ) / ( same for a2).

Which when a is much larger than R_s, (R_s/a) is small, so sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 ) ≈ 1 - (R_s²)/(2 a² )

So 1/sqrt(...) ≈ 1 + (R_s²)/(2 a² )

Then,

P1/P2 ≈ [1 + (R_s²)/(2 a1² ) ] / [1 + (R_s²)/(2 a2² ) ]

= [1 + (R_s²)/(2 (0.6 a2)^2 ) ] / [1 + (R_s²)/(2 a2^2 ) ]

= [1 + (R_s²)/(1.2 a2² ) ] / [1 + (R_s²)/(2 a2² ) ]

Let me denote y = R_s²/(a2² )

Then,

P1/P2 ≈ [1 + y/(1.2) ] / [1 + y/2 ]

If y is very small, then the ratio is approximately (y/1.2) / (y/2 ) ) = (2)/(1.2) )= 5/3 ≈1.666...

So in this case, the ratio approaches about 1.666 times.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the impact of a1 and a2 in the denominator, I thought it's 2.77 times, but now with the expansion up to second order, it's 1.666 times.

Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not exactly sure of the correct formula, which is making it hard to proceed.

But given the options, perhaps the correct choice is option C, which states that Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Given that a1 = 0.6 a2, and transit probability is inversely proportional to a, the ratio would be 1/0.6 ≈1.666.

So option C, which is 1.65 times, is the closest.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula and the given parameters. The transit probability for a planet depends on the semi-major axis \(a\), the radius of the planet \(R_p\), and the radius of the host star \(R_s\). For circular orbits, the transit probability is approximately proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{a}
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Planet Masses**: Both planets have the same mass, so \(R_p\) (radius of the planet) is assumed to be the same for both.
2. **Host Star Radii**: Both stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)).
3. **Orbital Periods**: The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2 (\(P_1 = P_2 / 3\)).
4. **Host Star Masses**: The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2 (\(M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}\)).

### Step 1: Semi-Major Axis Comparison
Using Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is related to the orbital period \(P\) and the host star's mass \(M_s\) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{s1} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2 \cdot (P_2/3)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\(P \propto 1/a\)). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]

This indicates that Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Matching with Options
The closest option to the calculated ratio is **C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit**.

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability because its shorter orbital period results in a smaller semi-major axis, increasing the likelihood of a transit. The transit probability ratio is approximately 1.65, aligning with option C.
