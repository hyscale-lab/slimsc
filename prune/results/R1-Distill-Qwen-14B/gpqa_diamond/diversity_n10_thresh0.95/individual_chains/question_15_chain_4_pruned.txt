Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But wait, their masses are the same. Oh, and Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

Both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit. The host stars have the same radius, but the mass of Planet_1's star is twice that of Planet_2's star. Wait, why do the masses matter? Because the star's mass affects the planet's orbit, maybe, or the probability of transit.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, as well as the size of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability (p) is something like p = (R_planet + R_star) / a, but I'm not too sure. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, I think the transit probability is calculated based on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. It's a geometric probability. The formula I remember is p = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but since the planet is Earth-like and probably small compared to the star, maybe the R_planet part is negligible. So approximately, p ≈ R_star / a, but wait, no. Wait, actually, the correct formula for the probability is p = (R_star / a) * (sin i), where i is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But if the planet's orbit isn't aligned edge-on, you don't see a transit. So the probability is actually the fraction of all possible inclinations that would result in a transit. So the actual probability is roughly (R_star / a), assuming that the orbit is randomly oriented.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance (a), multiplied by the probability that the inclination is right. Oh, wait, more accurately, the probability is given by p = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller, it's approximately R_star / a.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up some factors. Let me dig deeper. The probability is actually the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit projects onto the sky. Or wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the diameter of the star to the diameter of the orbit at the star's distance. Hmm.

Wait, I think the formula is p = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) )) or something like that, but I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the RV method gives us information about the planet's mass and orbital period, but that doesn't directly affect the transit probability.

Wait, no. The RV method tells us the mass (minimum) and the period, but the transit probability is purely a geometric consideration, not depending on the mass. So the mass of the planet doesn't affect the transit probability. So the mass of the planet is irrelevant here. So I can ignore that part.

So, the key factors are the orbital distance (a), the size of the star (R_star), and the size of the planet (R_planet). Since both planets are Earth-like, their R_planet is similar, so I can approximate R_planet as being the same for both. So R_planet_1 ≈ R_planet_2.

The transit probability p is proportional to (R_star / a), but wait, no, because a is the semi-major axis, but as seen from Earth, the actual distance that matters is a multiplied by sin(i), but i is unknown. Oh wait, no. The transit probability is actually the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The formula I recall is p = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)).

But again, since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, this is approximately R_star / a.

But wait, another point: the star's mass affects the planet's orbit. Because the semi-major axis a is determined by Kepler's third law, which relates a^3 to (M_star + M_planet) * P^2. But since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, we can ignore it, so
