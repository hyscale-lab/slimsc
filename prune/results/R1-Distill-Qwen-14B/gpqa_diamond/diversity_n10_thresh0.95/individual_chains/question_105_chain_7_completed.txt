Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the scenario is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, only one hemisphere is spotted, and this causes brightness variations as it spins. The question says this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the same kind of dip in brightness when it transits the star. So, the problem is asking: what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the spots do now? And they want the ratio Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, okay. So I think the key here is comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to the variation caused by a planet transit. So I need to find the exoplanet radius that gives the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

First, let's think about how the spots affect brightness. The star's total brightness without spots is based on its radius and temperature. When spots are present, they are cooler, so they contribute less light. The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view.

The filling factor is 20%, which means 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, actually, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the total spotted area is 20% of the star's hemisphere.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Now, the star's total luminosity without spots is L = 4πR² σ Teff⁴. But when spots are present, the observed luminosity changes as the spots rotate into view.

The spots are cooler: Teff is 6000 K, so spot temperature is 5000 K, right? Because the temperature difference is 1000 K. So each spot emits less light.

So the difference in luminosity when the spots are visible compared to when they're not is the change in the star's light due to the spots. The amplitude of the brightness variation would be the maximum dip.

Wait, no. The star's brightness without spots is L. When spots are facing us, the spots' lower luminosity contributes less, so the observed brightness is lower. So the dip in brightness is the area of the spots times the difference in their flux compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, I think the approach is to compute the relative change in brightness when spots are visible. Let's calculate the fractional change in luminosity.

The star's total flux without spots is F = σ Teff^4. The spots have a flux of σ (Teff - 1000)^4. So the difference per unit area is (F - F_spots)/F = [σ (6000^4 - 5000^4)] / σ 6000^4 = (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4.

Wait, but actually, the area of the spots is 0.4π R², as calculated earlier. So the total flux from the spots is (0.4π R²) * σ (5000)^4. The total flux from the entire star (without spots) is 4π R² σ (6000)^4. But when spots are present, the total flux is (4π R² σ (6000)^4 ) - (0.4π R² σ (6000)^4 - 0.4π R² σ (5000)^4 )). Hmmm, maybe I should think in terms of fractional change.

Alternatively, the relative change in flux when the spots are on the visible side is (Flux spots - Flux without spots) / Flux without spots.

Wait, actually, the star's total flux when the spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The unspotted part is (2π R² - 0.4π R²) area. So 1.6 π R². The flux from that part is 1.6 π R² * σ (6000^4). The spotted part is 0.4 π R² * σ (5000^4). So total flux is (1.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) * π R² σ.

The star's flux without any spots would be 2π R² * σ (6000^4) (since the star's radius is R, and the hemisphere facing us is 2π R²). Wait, no, wait, the star's entire surface is 4π R², but when we see a hemisphere, it's 2π R². So if there are no spots, the flux is 2π R² * σ (6000^4).

But when the spots are visible, the flux is (1.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) * π R² σ. Wait, no, the area is 2π R², and 20% of that is 0.4 π R². So in the hemisphere, the unspotted area is 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R². So the flux is (1.6 π R² * (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² (5000^4)) * σ.

So the change in flux is [ (1.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) - (2 *6000^4) ) ] * π R² σ.

Wait, when there are spots, the flux is (1.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4) * π R² σ.

Without spots, it's (2 *6000^4 ) * π R² σ.

So the difference is (1.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 - 2 *6000^4) = ( -0.4 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ) = 0.4 (5000^4 -6000^4 ) = 0.4 ( (5/6)^4 ) *6000^4.

Wait, let me compute 5000/6000 =5/6 ≈0.8333. (5/6)^4 is approximately (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 0.4*(0.48225 -1) *6000^4 = 0.4*(-0.51775)*6000^4 = -0.2071 *6000^4.

So the flux when spots are present is the original flux (2 *6000^4 * π R² σ) minus 0.2071 *6000^4 * π R² σ. Wait, wait, no. The calculation is:

Flux with spots = (1.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ) * π R² σ.

Flux without spots = 2 *6000^4 * π R² σ.

So the change is Flux_with - Flux_without = (1.6*6000^4 +0.4*5000^4 - 2*6000^4 ) * π R² σ.

Which is: ( -0.4 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ) * π R² σ.

So that's 0.4 (5000^4 −6000^4 ) * π R² σ.

Factor out 6000^4: 0.4 *6000^4 ( (5/6)^4 −1 ) = 0.4 *6000^4 ( ( (5/6)^4 ) -1 )

Compute (5/6)^4: 5^4=625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 ≈0.48225.

So, 0.48225 -1= -0.51775.

Multiply by 0.4 *6000^4: 0.4 * (-0.51775) = -0.2071.

So the change in flux is -0.2071 *6000^4 * π R² σ.

So the fractional change (delta F / F) is [ (-0.2071 *6000^4 ) * π R² σ ] / [2 *6000^4 * π R² σ ].

Simplify: (-0.2071)/2 = -0.10355.

So the fractional change is approximately -10.355%. But wait, the question is about the amplitude of the variation. So that's the depth of the dip. So the amplitude is about 10.35% dip in brightness.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum dip occurs when the spots are fully in front. The amplitude is the depth of that dip.

So the star's brightness variation due to the spots is about 10.35% dip.

Now, the question says, what's the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude? So when a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the light, causing a dip. The dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is π R_planet², and the star's area as seen is π R_star². So the fractional dip is (R_planet / R_star )².

So we want (R_planet / R_star )² = 0.10355.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, the dip when the planet transits is (area of planet)/(area of star) = (R_p / R_s )².

But in the spot case, the dip is 10.35% (about 0.1035). So to get the same dip, the planet's area must be 0.1035 of the star's area.

So solving R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, because 0.316^2 is about 0.1. Wait, wait, sqrt(0.1035) is approximately 0.3217.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.1035):

I know that 0.32^2 is 0.1024.

0.32^2 = 0.1024.

0.321^2 = (0.32 +0.001)^2 = 0.32^2 + 2*(0.32)*0.001 + (0.001)^2 = 0.1024 +0.00064 +0.000001 = 0.103041.

0.322^2 = (0.32 +0.002)^2 = 0.32^2 + 2*0.32*0.002 + (0.002)^2 = 0.1024 + 0.00128 + 0.000004 = 0.103684.

So sqrt(0.1035) is approximately 0.3218.

So R_p/R_s ≈0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32.

But wait, let me recheck the spot calculation because I might have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: The star's brightness variation due to spots is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when spots are visible.

The unspotted area when the spots are visible is 1.6 pi R².

Flux when spots are visible: (1.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) * pi R² * sigma.

Flux without spots: 2 pi R² *6000^4 * sigma.

So the fractional change is [ (1.6*6^4 +0.4*5^4 ) - 2*6^4 ] / (2*6^4 )

Which is [ (1.6 - 2) *6^4 + 0.4*5^4 ] / (2 *6^4 )

= [ (-0.4 *6^4 ) + 0.4 *5^4 ] / (2 *6^4 )

Factor out 0.4:

0.4 [ (-6^4 +5^4 ) ] / (2 *6^4 )

= 0.4 (5^4 -6^4 ) / (2 *6^4 )

Wait, yeah, same as before.

But let me compute 5^4 and 6^4.

5^4 = 625, 6^4 = 1296.

So 5^4 -6^4 = 625 -1296 = -671.

So 0.4 * (-671) = -268.4.

Denominator: 2 *6^4 = 2*1296=2592.

So fractional change: (-268.4 ) / 2592 ≈ -0.1035, same as before.

So the dip is about 10.35% of the star's flux.

So the planet would need to cause a dip of the same percentage, which would require (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.1035, so R_p/R_s ≈0.3218.

Looking at the options, D is 0.32.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So D is 0.32, which is close to our calculated 0.3218.

But wait, another thing. The problem says "the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". Wait, no, the star is covered by spots, and the effect is like a planet. So when the star is not covered by spots, what happens? No, no. The problem is that the starspots cause a dip in brightness similar to a planet transit. So we need to find the planet's radius that would cause the same dip as the spots do. So yes, I think my approach is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. When a planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2. But the spots are on one hemisphere, and when they rotate into view, the dip is 10.35% as we found. But wait, is that the maximum dip? Because when the spots are on the limb, perhaps the blocking is less. Oh, but in this problem, the situation is that the spots are on one hemisphere, and as the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view. So the maximum dip is when the maximum area of the spots is visible. So it's the same as when the planet is directly in front, causing maximum dip.

So the calculation should be correct. So the planet's radius would need to be about 0.32 times the star's radius.

But wait, wait a second. The star's radius is same as Sun's, so R_star = R_sun. So R_planet = 0.32 R_sun. But that's a planet with radius about a third of the Sun's, which is way larger than Jupiter. Jupiter's radius is about 0.1 R_sun.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the star's radius is same as the Sun's, R_star = R_sun. So a planet with R_p = 0.32 R_sun would have a radius of 0.32 * (7e5 km) ≈ 225,000 km. But Jupiter's radius is about 70,000 km. So this planet would be 3 times larger than Jupiter, which is possible but unlikely. But the options include D) 0.32, so perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, when the planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_star )². So, dip = (Rp/Rs)^2.

We have dip = 0.1035, so Rp/Rs = sqrt(0.1035) ≈0.3218.

So Rp is about 32% of the star's radius.

But the star's radius is same as the Sun's, so Rp is 0.32 R_sun, which is way larger than any known planet. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I got the calculation of the star's dip wrong. Because the star is not completely covered by spots, but only a part. So perhaps the dip is not as large as I calculated.

Wait, another approach. The star's brightness is measured as the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions. Let me calculate the fraction of the star's brightness that is replaced by spots.

So, the star's total area is 4 pi R^2, but we're seeing a hemisphere (2 pi R²). The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so area=0.2 * 2 pi R² =0.4 pi R².

The flux without spots on the hemisphere is 2 pi R² * sigma (6000)^4.

The flux with spots is (2 pi R² -0.4 pi R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4.

So, flux with spots = 1.6 pi R² * sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4.

The difference is (1.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ) * pi R² sigma - (2 *6000^4 ) * pi R² sigma.

So, the change in flux is [1.6 *6^4 +0.4 *5^4 - 2 *6^4 ] * pi R² sigma.

Which is [ -0.4 *6^4 +0.4 *5^4 ] * pi R² sigma.

So as before, the fractional change is [ ( -0.4*(6^4) +0.4*(5^4) ) ] / (2 *6^4 )

Which is [ 0.4 (5^4 -6^4 ) ] / (2 *6^4 )

Which is 0.4 (625-1296 ) / (2*1296 )

Which is 0.4 * (-671) / 2592.

Compute numerator: 0.4 * (-671) = -268.4.

-268.4 /2592 ≈ -0.1035.

So dip is about 10.35%, same as before.

Hmm, so perhaps my initial approach is correct, but that would mean the planet is 0.32 R_sun, which is way too big.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

The question says: To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star?

Ah, wait a second. If the star wasn't covered by spots, the same amplitude would be caused by a planet. But the star is actually covered by spots, which cause a dip. So the question is, how big a planet would cause a dip of the same amplitude as the spots do.

Wait, but the dip caused by the spots is 10.35% as we calculated. So the planet's dip would have to be 10.35%, so (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rs = 0.3218.

But that's a very large planet, which is bigger than Jupiter. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the calculation of the dip caused by the spots is wrong because the spots are on the far side when the star isn't rotating, but when it rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, which is 10.35% of the star's light.

But perhaps I should model the brightness variation differently. Let me think about the star's flux when the spots are on the far side and when they're on the near side.

When the spots are not visible (e.g., when the star isn't rotating), the flux is F = 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

When the spots are fully visible (rotated into view), the flux is F' = (2 pi R² - 0.4 pi R² ) sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4.

So the change in flux is F' - F = [ (1.6 *6^4 + 0.4 *5^4 ) - 2 *6^4 ] * pi R² sigma.

Which again is ( -0.4 *6^4 +0.4 *5^4 ) * pi R² sigma.

So the dip is (F - F')/F = [ (0.4 *6^4 -0.4 *5^4 ) ] / (2 *6^4 )

Wait, no. The dip is F - F' because F' is less than F.

So dip = (F - F')/F = [ (0.4 (6^4 -5^4 )) ] / (2 *6^4 )

Which is [0.4 ( (1296 - 625) ) ] / (2 *1296 )

= 0.4 * 671 / 2592.

0.4 *671 = 268.4.

268.4 /2592 ≈ 0.1035.

So same as before.

So the dip is 10.35%, same as before.

Thus, the planet would need to cause a dip of about 10.35%, so Rp/Rs ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ~0.3218.

So the answer would be D) ~0.32.

But wait, let me check if I got the question right. The problem says that the star is covered with spots on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, only one hemisphere's worth of spots affects the flux. But the planet transiting would block flux from the entire star, so perhaps the dip is larger.

Wait, no. The planet transiting would block a part of the star's disk, leading to a dip proportional to (Rp/Rs)^2. The spots dip is 10.35% in the same way.

So the calculation should be correct.

But why is the planet radius so large? Jupiter's radius is about 0.1 R_sun. 0.32 R_sun is about three times Jupiter's size. Hmm.

Well, perhaps the answer is D) 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Temperature of spots: \( T_{\text{spots}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), but only a hemisphere (\( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \)) is observed at any time.
   - Spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, so the spotted area is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The unspotted area of the hemisphere is \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 - 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).

   The total flux from the star without spots is:
   \[
   F_{\text{no spots}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
   \]
   where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

   The total flux when spots are visible is:
   \[
   F_{\text{spots}} = (1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4)
   \]

   The fractional change in flux (dip in brightness) is:
   \[
   \Delta F / F = \frac{F_{\text{no spots}} - F_{\text{spots}}}{F_{\text{no spots}}}
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   \Delta F / F = \frac{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - (1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4)}{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \Delta F / F = \frac{-0.4 T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 T_{\text{spots}}^4}{2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}
   \]
   Factor out \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 \):
   \[
   \Delta F / F = \frac{0.4 (T_{\text{spots}}^4 - T_{\text{eff}}^4)}{2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}
   \]
   Compute \( T_{\text{spots}}^4 / T_{\text{eff}}^4 \):
   \[
   \frac{T_{\text{spots}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.48225
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   \Delta F / F = \frac{0.4 (0.48225 - 1)}{2} = \frac{0.4 (-0.51775)}{2} \approx -0.10355
   \]
   The fractional dip in brightness is approximately \( -10.35\% \).

### Exoplanet Brightness Variation:
The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
\[
\Delta F / F = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
\]
We set this equal to the dip caused by the spots:
\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035
\]
Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218
\]
Thus, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \).

### Conclusion:
The radius of the exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the spots is closest to **0.32**.

Answer: D
