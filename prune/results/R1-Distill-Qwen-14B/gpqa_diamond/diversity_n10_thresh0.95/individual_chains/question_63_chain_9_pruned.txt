Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule, made of elements X and Y. They're modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that should be absorbed so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, okay. So the options are given with different momenta values. The masses of X and Y are 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the fundamental state... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So if the molecule is in its fundamental state, it's in the lowest possible energy level. But the question says it absorbs a photon and switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that must be the first excited state.

I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both the rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question is about the transition upon absorbing a photon. So the photon's energy should match the energy difference between two states.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because momentum p is related to energy for a photon. But I need to recall the correct formulas.

So, first, let's think about the energy levels. In the case of a diatomic molecule, the energy levels for vibration and rotation are considered. But since the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, perhaps the energy depends on both rotation and vibration?

Wait, but the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next possible state would be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, but the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm. So the next state is the one with the least energy higher than the current. So perhaps it's the next rotational state if that's the closest in energy than a vibrational transition.

Alternatively, the "fundamental state" refers to the lowest vibrational state, and the next state could be the first vibrational excited state (v=1), but I'm a bit confused. Wait, I think for a diatomic molecule, the fundamental vibrational state is v=0. So the next state would be v=1, but if the rotation is already at J=0, perhaps the next state could involve a change in rotation or vibration.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibration is considered as well as rotation, so the total energy is a combination of both. But I'm a bit unsure. Let me think about the energy levels for a molecule. In the rigid rotor approximation, the rotational energy is quantized, but when the rotor is non-rigid, perhaps there's also a vibrational component.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's energy is a sum of its vibrational and rotational energies. So, the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state would be the next allowed state, which could be either J=1 (rotation) or v=1 (vibration). Whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're to find the photon that gets it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think the energy difference would be the smallest possible transition. So, perhaps the smallest energy jump is a rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the first excited vibrational state. Because, for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy spacing is higher than rotational, right? Because the vibrational energy depends on the bond's force constant, which is higher, so the energy levels are more spaced out.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The energy levels for rotation are given by something like E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the spacing between vibrational levels is h w. For rotational transitions, the spacing between adjacent J levels is about 2 B (since E(J+1) - E(J) = B ( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ) = B (2J+2) )= 2B (J+1). So for J=0, the spacing is 2B. 

So if B is small, the rotational energy spacing is much smaller than the vibrational spacing. So the photon absorption to the next state would likely be a rotational transition, but perhaps in the case where B is larger, it might be a vibrational transition.

Wait, but in this problem, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0). So the next state is either the next vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). Which transition requires less energy?

Hmm. Let's compute the energy differences.

Given w = 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy difference is h w. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, but that's the energy for a vibrational transition. What about a rotational transition?

The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by h/(8 pi^2 I c), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, B can be approximated as ħ^2/(2 I), but I'm not sure. Wait, I think the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J + 1), with B = (h/(8 π² I)).

So first, I need to find I, the moment of inertia. I is given by μ r², where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms and r is the bond length.

Given Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let me compute that.

Mx = 20, My=2. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

Wait, but let me compute that more precisely. 20/11 is approximately 1.81818... So 1.81818 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 is approximately 1.81818 * 1.66e-27. Let me compute that: 1.81818 * 1.66 is about 3.01. So μ ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by h/(8 π² I). Let's compute that.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

So B = (6.626e-34) / (8 * π² * 1.204e-46)

Compute denominator: 8 * (pi^2) ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator = 78.9568 * 1.204e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.204 ≈ 95.01, so 95.01e-46.

Wait, wait, 8*pi^2 is about 78.9568, correct. Then I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

So denominator is 78.9568 * 1.204e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.204 = let's compute that:

78.9568 * 1 =78.9568, 78.9568 * 0.2=15.791, 78.9568 * 0.004=0.3158. So total is approx 78.9568 +15.791=94.747
