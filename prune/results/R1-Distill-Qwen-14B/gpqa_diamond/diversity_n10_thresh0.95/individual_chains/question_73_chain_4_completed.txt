Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, the question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses of 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, both are moving in the same direction, right? 

I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight. The formula for the relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction, from the perspective of the slower one or the faster one?

Wait, no, the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) when v2 is the velocity of the second object relative to the first. Let me check that. If object A is moving at v1 and object B at v2 (both in same direction), then the velocity of B relative to A is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). 

So in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So when the first is considering the second, the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. v2 is 0.5c, v1 is 0.6c. So the numerator is (0.5 - 0.6) c = (-0.1 c). The denominator is 1 - (0.6*0.5 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1 c) / 0.7. The negative sign indicates direction—since 0.5c is less than 0.6c, the second is moving slower, so from the first's perspective, the second is moving backward? Wait, no, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed should be positive. Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the frame of reference. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So in A's frame, the speed of B would be calculated as (vB - vA)/(1 - (vA vB)/(c²)). So (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) ) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.1428c. The negative sign suggests that in A's frame, B is moving in the opposite direction. Wait, that can't be right because both are moving in the same direction from the lab frame. Hmm, maybe I should take the absolute value here because relative speed is a scalar? Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The correct formula for the relative velocity u is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c²)), where u' is the velocity of the object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (the observer's velocity). Oh wait, wait, the formula for transforming velocities from one frame to another is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)). So in this case, if we want the velocity of B as seen from A's frame, A's speed in the lab frame is v = 0.6c, and B's speed in lab frame is u' = 0.5c. So u, the velocity of B relative to A, is (0.5c + 0.6c) / (1 + (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) )? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait a second—no, that would be the case if u' is the velocity of B in A's frame, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait no, in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective (A is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab), what is B's velocity? Using the velocity transformation formula:

u = (u' - v) / (1 - (u' v)/(c²))

Wait no, perhaps I got it backwards earlier. The correct formula is u = (u' - v) / (1 - (u' v)/(c²)), where u' is the velocity of the object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (A's speed relative to the lab). So in this case, u' is 0.5c (B's velocity in lab), and v is 0.6c (A's velocity in lab). So u = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) ) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) )= (-0.1c)/0.7 = approx -0.1428c.

That would imply that from A's frame, B is moving at -0.1428c, meaning in the opposite direction. But that's not possible because both are moving in the same direction in the lab frame. So I must have mixed up the formula.

Wait, maybe I should use u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)). Wait, no, that's when you're moving in the same direction as the object. Let me clarify the formula.

The correct velocity transformation formula from the lab frame (where A is moving at velocity v) to A's rest frame is u = (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/(c^2)). So plugging u' = 0.5c (B's speed in lab) and v = 0.6c (A's speed in lab), u = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c^2)) ) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) )= (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.1428c.

Wait, that suggests that from A's perspective, B is moving at -0.1428c, which is in the opposite direction. But in reality, since both are moving in the same direction, B should be moving slower than A, but in the same direction. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c, but relativistically, that's not accurate. So why does the formula give a negative value?

Ah, I think I must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again. The correct formula for the relative velocity when moving from frame S (lab) to frame S' (A's frame) is u = (u' - v) / (1 - (u' v)/(c^2)), where u' is the velocity of object B in frame S, and v is the velocity of S' relative to S. So in this case, v is 0.6c (since S' is moving at 0.6c relative to S). So for B, u' is 0.5c.

So u = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c^2) ) ) → (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) → (-0.1c)/0.7 → approximately -0.1428c.

Hmm, that's a negative value, which suggests that in A's frame, B is moving in the opposite direction. But that doesn't make sense because in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction. So maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the absolute value, since relative speed is a magnitude.

Wait, but in reality, if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's perspective, B is moving backward? That doesn't sound right. That would suggest that A is moving faster than B in the same direction, so from A's frame, B appears to be moving backward relative to A. But that would mean that the relative speed is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c in the same direction, but relativistically, that's not as straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the speed of B relative to A as (v_A - v_B)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c^2)). Wait, no, that would be the case if I'm calculating from B's frame. Let me get this straight.

The formula for the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But I'm getting a bit confused about which is which.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the problem from the perspective of the lab frame. The relative speed would be the difference in their velocities, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative speed as (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) → (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) → 0.1c / 0.7 → approx 0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. That makes sense because when moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c^2)).

Wait, but earlier I thought that gave a negative number when I did it the other way around. Maybe I should pick the correct formula based on the direction. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the relative speed of an object B as seen from A's frame (when both are moving in the same direction) is (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c^2)). Oh wait, no, maybe not. Let me think of a simple example. Suppose A is moving at 0.8c, and B is moving at 0.8c. Then from A's frame, B should appear stationary. Let's plug into the formula.

v_B = 0.8c, v_A = 0.8c. So (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)) → (0)/(1 - 0.64) → 0. So that's correct. Another example: If in lab frame, A is at 0.6c and B at 0.5c. Then from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) ) → (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → -0.1428c. So the negative indicates direction. So from A's frame, B is moving backward at 0.1428c. But that doesn't make sense because both are moving in the same direction in the lab frame. How can B appear to move backward from A's perspective?

Ah, wait, perhaps in the lab frame, A is moving faster than B. So from A's perspective, it's moving forward, and B is moving backward. So the relative speed would be the speed at which B is moving backward relative to A, which is 0.14c.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. Now, the other part is the total energy of the system.

The total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc². So for the first astronaut with mass 2m moving at 0.6c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is gamma * m_rest * c². But wait, the rest mass is 2m, so the energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, no, wait. The problem states that the masses are 2m and 3m. So the rest energy of the first is (2m) c^2 multiplied by gamma. Wait, no, the total energy is gamma * m_rest * c². So for the first astronaut, E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c². Gamma1 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) ) = 1/sqrt(0.64) )= 1.25. So E1 =1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) ) =1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² =1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc² → matches our calculation.

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc² → energy is 5, which is less than our calculation.

So the correct option should be option C: v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction with speeds \( v_1 = 0.6c \) and \( v_2 = 0.5c \). The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass: \( 2m \)
- Speed: \( v_1 = 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass: \( 3m \)
- Speed: \( v_2 = 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E \approx 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2 \)**
