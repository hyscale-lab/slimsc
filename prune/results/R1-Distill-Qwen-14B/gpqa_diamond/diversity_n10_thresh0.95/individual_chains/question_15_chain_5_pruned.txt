Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, let's see what the question says. So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1 and P2 is 3P1, or wait, no, the other way around. Oh wait, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 100 days, Planet_1's would be about 33 days. So orbital period of Planet_1 is shorter.

They both have circular orbits, so eccentricity isn't a factor. The host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they have same radii. But the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 is 2*M2.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So the probability of transit depends on the size of the planet and the size of the star, but also the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But wait, since both are already detected via RV, does that affect the transit probability? Because RV detection tells us about the mass and the period, but not the inclination. Wait, no, RV can give a lower mass limit because it depends on sin(i), right? So if a planet is detected via RV, the actual mass could be higher because sin(i) is up to 1. But for the transit method, the probability depends on the alignment—so the chance that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough for a transit.

Wait, but the question states that they are attempting to detect transits, so the RV detection allows us to know the minimum mass, but for the transit probability, the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star, and the orbital distance, which affects the chance of alignment.

I remember that the transit probability is given by the formula P = R_p² / (a (R_s + R_p))³. Or wait, maybe it's more about the relative size and orbital distance. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by something else. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Oh right, the probability of a planet transiting is roughly (R_p / a)², but wait, no, that's not right. The actual formula for the transit probability is (R_p + R_s)² / (a²) ) × (something else?), but I might be mixing it up.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is given by the ratio of the size of the star plus the planet to the distance of the planet from the star cubed, multiplied by the chance that the orbital plane is aligned. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the relative sizes and orbital distance.

I think the formula for the probability that a planet transits is (2π R_p) / (a * period) ) × something. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is proportional to (R_s + R_p)² / a³. Wait, but I might be getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, the transit probability also depends on the host star's size and the planet's orbital distance. The formula is P = ( (R_p + R_s) / a )^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / a )^2 ) or something. No, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is approximately (R_p / a)^2 * (R_s / a)^2, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, the transit probability for a circular orbit is given by the formula P = (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2 (R_s + R_p + R_p') ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to think about the transit probability formula. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will produce a transit is given by the formula P ≈ (R_s + R_p)² / (a²), but that doesn't seem dimensionally correct. Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability can be approximated by (π R_p²) / (a²), but again, I'm not certain.

Let me think differently. The transit occurs when the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, aligns with the star's position. The probability depends on the size of the star and the distance of the planet from the star. The chance that the orbital inclination is such that the planet passes in front of the star is given by P = (R_s + R_p) / a, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because when a is the semi-major axis
