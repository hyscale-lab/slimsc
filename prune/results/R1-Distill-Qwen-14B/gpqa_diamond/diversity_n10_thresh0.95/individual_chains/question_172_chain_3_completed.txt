Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question states that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermal equilibrium (LTE), so I think I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels in a system to temperature. The formula I remember is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe n_1 is twice n_2, where n is the number density. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think that means the number of atoms in a higher energy state (let's say level 2) compared to the lower state (level 1) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says 'iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.' So perhaps for a particular energy level, the excitation is higher. Oh, but wait, the excitation difference is given, so maybe we can model it as the ratio of populations.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the upper level to the lower level in star 1 is twice that of star 2. So like, for star 1, n_upper / n_lower = 2 * (n_upper' / n_lower') for star 2.

But the ratio for each star is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J.

For star 1, the ratio is (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2, (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2. So:

(n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2)/(n_lower2)

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. So ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange the terms. Let's move the terms involving ΔE to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Alternatively, ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So putting it all together:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the problem asks for an equation in terms of T1 and T2. Let's see the options.

Wait, the options have ln(2) on the left. So I can rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2):

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But in the options, the right-hand side is in terms of expressions with T1 and T2. Let's see the options provided.

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, in our equation, it's [ΔE/(k)] multiplied by that ratio. So unless ΔE/(k) is 1, which I don't think it is.

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute ΔE/(k). Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait! The ΔE is exactly k multiplied by 1, because 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = (k * 1) )/k = 1.

So that term is 1. Therefore, our equation simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which is option D.


The problem involves comparing the excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution relates the population of energy levels to temperature, and the given energy difference between the energy levels is \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). 

For star 1, the ratio of the populations of the upper and lower energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]

and for star 2:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that of star 2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Using the identity \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the term \( \Delta E / k = 1 \). Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. 

Answer: D
