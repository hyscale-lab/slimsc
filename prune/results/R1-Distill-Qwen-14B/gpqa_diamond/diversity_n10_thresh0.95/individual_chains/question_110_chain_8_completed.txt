--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to remember what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter than 17? Oh right, because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17, meaning any star with V less than or equal to 17 is observable.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So anything with V <=16 is observable by HIRES. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. It says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO," meaning that if a star's apparent V is less than 17, it's visible. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so V less than or equal to 16 is observed.

Wait no, actually, the exact wording is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So if a star's V is brighter (i.e., lower number) than 17, like 16 or 15, it's observable. Similarly, for HIRES, brighter than 16 V, so V <=16 is visible.

So the key is, a star must be observable by both spectrographs. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. But ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so if HIRES can't see it, neither can we for both.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So a star must satisfy the apparent V magnitude for both. So the apparent V must be <=16, because HIRES can't see beyond that. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so any star that's V <=16 can be seen by both. Because if V is <=16, then both can observe it. If V is between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it.

But wait, the other thing is that some stars have extinction (dust and gas), which affects the apparent magnitude. The question mentions that for Star3 and Star4, there's E(B-V), the color excess, which relates to the total absorption in the V band. The note says that the total absorption is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So the formula is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). Oh right, because extinction in V is Av = 3.1 * (B-V) color excess.

So for those stars, their apparent V magnitude is actually brighter than their intrinsic (absolute) V magnitude plus extinction. Let me think: the formula is apparent V = absolute V + distance modulus + extinction.

Wait, no. Wait, the distance modulus is 5 log10 (d/10 pc), where d is distance in pc. And extinction (Av) is the amount by which the star is dimmed. So the observed apparent magnitude is the intrinsic apparent magnitude (which would be absolute mag + distance modulus) plus extinction. Wait, no: actually, the formula is:

apparent magnitude = absolute magnitude + distance modulus + extinction (Av)

Yes. Because the absolute magnitude is what the star's apparent magnitude would be at 10 pc distance, without any extinction. So when it's at a distance d, the distance modulus adds 5 log(d/10) to the absolute magnitude, making it fainter. But extinction makes it even fainter, so we add the extinction (which is positive) to the apparent magnitude.

Wait, but wait: if a star is behind dust, it looks dimmer, so its apparent magnitude increases. So when we calculate the apparent magnitude, we have to correct for extinction. So apparent magnitude observed is equal to the apparent magnitude without extinction plus the extinction Av.

So the observed V (m_obs) = m_intrinsic + Av.

Alternatively, the formula is:

m_obs = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av

So for each star, I need to compute its apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction, and then see if it's <=16 (since both can only detect stars brighter than 17 and 16 respectively; but wait, no, they can detect up to 17 and 16. So if a star's m_obs is <=16, both can detect it. If m_obs is <=17 but >16, only ESPRESSO can detect it. But the question is which stars can be detected by both, so only the ones with m_obs <=16.

So for each star, calculate m_obs = M_abs + 5 log(d/10) + Av.

But first, let's go through each star.

Star1: Given that it has absolute V magnitude of 15.5, located at 10 pc. So distance modulus is 5 log(10/10) = 0. So m_intrinsic = 15.5 + 0 =15.5. Any extinction? No, because Star1's info doesn't mention E(B-V), so E(B-V)=0. Therefore, Av=3.1 * 0=0. So m_obs =15.5. Both spectrographs can see this? Because 15.5 <=16 (HIRES limit) and <=17 (ESPRESSO). So yes, Star1 can be seen by both.

Wait, wait, but wait: the question says, "apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO", which means that if a star's apparent V is <=17, it's observable. So for Star1, m_obs=15.5, which is <=17 and <=16, so both can see it.

Star2: Apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5. So m_obs =16.5. Now, we have to consider if this is corrected for extinction. Wait, the question says for Star2, the apparent V is 16.5. But Star2's parameters don't mention E(B-V), so I think it's safe to assume E(B-V)=0, so Av=0. So m_obs is 16.5.

But wait, if the apparent V is already given as 16.5, then that's the observed magnitude. So can HIRES detect it? HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, meaning m_obs <=16. So 16.5 is larger than 16, so it's not detectable by HIRES. So Star2 can't be detected by both. But wait, Star2's apparent V is 16.5. So ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 <=17), but HIRES can't (since 16.5>16). So Star2 can't be seen by both. So Star2 is out.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=3.1 * 0.6 =1.86. So the intrinsic apparent mag would be m_intrinsic = M_abs + distance modulus.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the apparent magnitude given is the observed one? Or the intrinsic one?

Wait, the problem says for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but we have to account for extinction. Because E(B-V) is given. Wait, let me read the note again. It says, "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So the apparent magnitude is the observed one, which is the intrinsic (what it would be without extinction) plus the extinction.

Wait, no, wait. When a star is observed, the apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av. So m_intrinsic is the apparent magnitude without extinction. So if a star's observed magnitude is m_obs, then m_intrinsic = m_obs - Av.

But wait, the problem says for Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5. That's the observed value, so to find the intrinsic apparent mag, we subtract Av. But wait, that doesn't make sense. No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no: the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = M + 5 log(d/10) + Av.

So M is the absolute magnitude, d is in parsecs.

For Star3, the parameters given are apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but that's the observed (m_obs) value. The E(B-V) is 0.6, so Av=3.1 * 0.6=1.86. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m_intrinsic = m_obs - Av = 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But wait, that's not needed for this calculation. Because when considering whether a star can be observed, the observed magnitude (including extinction) is what matters.

Wait, correction: The question is about what can be observed with the spectrographs, which is based on the apparent V magnitude as observed, including extinction.

So Star3's m_obs is 15.5. So, can both spectrographs detect it? HIRES can detect up to 16, so 15.5 is less than 16, so yes. ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so yes. Therefore, Star3 can be seen by both.

Wait, but wait: the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed value. So both can see it.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me recap: for each star, calculate the apparent V magnitude (including any extinction), then check if it is <=16 (for HIRES) and <=17 (for ESPRESSO). So for both, m_obs must be <=16.

So for Star3, m_obs=15.5, so yes.

Star4: absolute V=15.5, located at 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4. So Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So compute the apparent V mag.

M_abs is 15.5, distance modulus=5 log(10/10)=0. So m_intrinsic =15.5 +0=15.5. Then, m_obs = m_intrinsic + Av? Wait no, m_obs = m_intrinsic + Av? Wait, no, wait: no, m_obs is the apparent magnitude as observed (including extinction). So m_obs = M + 5 log(d/10) + Av.

So for Star4:

M=15.5, d=10 pc. So distance modulus is 0. Av=1.24.

So m_obs =15.5 +0 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, that's 16.74. So m_obs=16.74. So for HIRES, which can only go up to 16, this is 16.74 which is above 16. So HIRES can't detect it. ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 <=17. So Star4 can't be detected by both, only ESPRESSO.

Star5: absolute V=16.5, located at 5 pc. So compute m_obs.

First, M_abs=16.5, distance d=5 pc.

Distance modulus =5 log(5/10) =5 log(0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m_intrinsic = M_abs + distance modulus =16.5 -1.505=14.995. Approximately 15.0.

Does Star5 have any extinction? The question says for Star5, absolute V mag is 16.5, located at 5 pc. No mention of E(B-V), so I think E(B-V)=0, so Av=0.

So m_obs=15.0.

So m_obs=15.0.

So HIRES can detect it (15<=16), and ESPRESSO can as well (15<=17). So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, let me check all calculations again.

Let me re-calculate each star's m_obs:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So distance modulus 0. E(B-V)=0, so Av=0. So m_obs=15.5. So both can detect.

Star2: m_obs=16.5, E(B-V)=0. Av=0. So m_obs=16.5. HIRES can't (since 16.5>16). So Star2 only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m_obs=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=1.86. So m_obs = M_abs (which is from the problem statement—wait, wait, no. Wait, Star3's parameters are given as apparent V magnitude of 15.5. So that's already the observed value, including extinction. Wait, no. The problem states: Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So that apparent V is the observed, so m_obs=15.5.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if the star is at 15 pc, and has absolute magnitude M, then m_obs = M + 5 log(15/10) + Av. But the problem says Star3's apparent V is 15.5. So perhaps I should compute whether that's including extinction.

Wait, the problem says, for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So I think that the 15.5 is the observed magnitude (so m_obs=15.5), which already includes extinction. So no, that's not correct. Because m_obs is already what it's observed as, so you don't add more extinction.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's clarify the parameters:

Each star's parameters:

- Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0. So m_obs =15.5.

- Star2: m_obs=16.5, E(B-V)=0. So m_obs=16.5.

- Star3: m_obs=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So m_obs=15.5, but E(B-V) is given. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which affects the observed magnitude. So perhaps the given apparent V is the intrinsic (without extinction) and we have to compute the observed.

Wait, the problem states: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". So that's confusing. Because if the apparent magnitude is given, then what's the point of E(B-V)? Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which affects the observed magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's absolute magnitude is given, but for Star3, the apparent V is given, but without considering extinction? Or perhaps the apparent V is the observed one, which includes extinction.

Wait, the problem states for Star3 and Star4: the apparent V magnitude is given, and E(B-V) is provided. So perhaps, for Star3, the apparent V magnitude of 15.5 is the observed (including extinction) value, so we don't need to adjust it further.

Wait, but that's not correct because the E(B-V) is given, implying that the extinction (Av) is 3.1 * E(B-V), so that's 1.86. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude is m_intrinsic = m_obs - Av =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But why would the problem give us both the observed magnitude and the E(B-V)? That seems redundant unless I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent V magnitude given is the intrinsic (without extinction) and we need to calculate the observed. But that would complicate the matter. Let me re-express the problem.

Looking back: the problem says that Star3 and Star4 have E(B-V) given, but for Star1, 2, and 5, E(B-V) is not given, so E(B-V)=0 for them.

So for Star3:

- M_abs = (unknown, because the problem gives apparent V as 15.5, but that's confusing. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5, located at 15 pc, E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps I should compute the absolute magnitude and then go from there.

Wait, no. The problem gives for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Wait, that's the apparent V. So m_obs =15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

But wait, if the apparent V is 15.5, which is the observed, then the intrinsic apparent V would be m_intrinsic = m_obs - Av =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, why would the problem give you the apparent V with extinction already applied? Because then E(B-V) doesn't affect the apparent magnitude anymore. That seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent V is given as the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction), and we need to compute the observed, which is m_obs = m_intrinsic + Av.

But then, for Star3, the parameters would be:

- M_abs is not given. Wait, no, no. Because the problem doesn't give M_abs for Star3. Wait, the problem says for Star3: apparent V =15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, located at 15 pc.

So perhaps it's better to think that the apparent V is the observed one, so m_obs=15.5. So no need to adjust it.

Wait, but that can't be right because the question gives E(B-V), which is used to compute Av. So perhaps the given apparent V is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we have to compute the observed.

But how? Because if the apparent V is 15.5 without extinction, then the observed would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So m_obs=17.36.

Wait, but that would make the apparent V magnitude higher. So let me proceed with that approach.

So for Star3:

- m_intrinsic =15.5 (apparent V without extinction)
- Av=1.86
- m_obs =15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So m_obs=17.36.

Now, can the spectrographs detect this? HIRES can only go up to 16, so no. ESPRESSO goes up to 17, so yes. So Star3 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not both.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So this is confusing. Which approach is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent V given in the problem is already the observed one, including extinction. So for Star3, m_obs=15.5, so both spectrographs can see it.

But then why is the E(B-V) given? Because the apparent V is already given as 15.5. So perhaps the E(B-V) is irrelevant for the calculation, unless the star's absolute magnitude is needed for some other purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is structured differently. Let's think about each star's observable status.

Let me list each star with their m_obs:

Star1: m_obs=15.5, can be seen by both.

Star2: m_obs=16.5, can be seen by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: m_obs=15.5 (assuming that's the observed), but considering the E(B-V), perhaps the star's absolute magnitude is different. Wait, no, because the problem gives apparent V, so perhaps that's all.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me take a different approach.

For each star:

Calculate the apparent V magnitude, considering extinction if necessary.

Then, check if m_obs <=16 (for both) and <=17.

So:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10. So m_intrinsic=15.5. E(B-V)=0. So m_obs=15.5. Can be seen by both.

Star2: m_obs=16.5, E(B-V)=0. So m_obs=16.5. For HIRES, 16.5>16 => no. So can't be detected by both.

Star3: m_obs=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=1.86. Wait, but if the apparent V is given as 15.5, which is the observed, then it's already including extinction. So m_obs=15.5. So can be seen by both.

Wait, but that's inconsistent because the E(B-V) would imply that the star is more distant. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent V given is without considering extinction. So we have to compute the observed m_obs.

For Star3:

M_abs is not given. Wait, no, the problem doesn't provide the absolute magnitude for Star3. Oh wait, the problem only gives the apparent V and the distance. Wait, no: Star3's data is: apparent V of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, located at 15 pc.

So to compute the absolute magnitude, M = m - distance modulus.

Wait, but the apparent V given is 15.5. So M =15.5 - (5 log(15/10)).

Compute distance modulus: 5 log(15/10) =5 * log(1.5) ≈5 *0.1761≈0.8805.

So M =15.5 -0.8805≈14.6195.

But then, with M=14.62, located at 15 pc, and E(B-V)=0.6, so Av=1.86.

So the observed m_obs = M +5 log(d/10) + Av =14.62 +0.8805 +1.86 ≈17.36.

So m_obs≈17.36.

Which is above both 16 and 17, so can't be detected by either.

Wait, that can't be right because Star3 is a star with apparent V=15.5, which is bright.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's make a table.

Let me list each star, their given parameters, compute m_obs.

Star1:

- M_abs =15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.

m_intrinsic = M_abs + distance modulus.

Distance modulus: 5 log(10/10)=0.

m_intrinsic =15.5.

Av =3.1 * E(B-V) =0.

m_obs=15.5.

So both can see it.

Star2:

- m_obs=16.5, E(B-V)=0.

Av=0.

So m_obs=16.5. HIRES can't (needs <=16), so only ESPRESSO can.

Star3:

- m_obs (intrinsic)=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, d=15 pc.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: Star3's apparent V is 15.5. But if we want to compute the intrinsic magnitude, we have to subtract Av.

But wait, the given m_obs is 15.5, which already includes Av. So m_obs =15.5.

Alternatively, if m_obs is the intrinsic (without extinction), then m_obs (intrinsic) =15.5, and then m_obs (observed)=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

But that would make the star much fainter, so m_obs=17.36>17, not detectable by either.

But the problem states that Star3 has an apparent V of 15.5. So I think m_obs is 15.5, which is already observed (so includes extinction). So Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is within both spectrographs' limits.

Star4:

- M_abs=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

m_obs= M_abs + distance modulus + Av =15.5 +0 +1.24=16.74.

So m_obs=16.74>16. So HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can.

Star5:

- M_abs=16.5, d=5 pc, E(B-V)=0.

Distance modulus:5 log(5/10)=5 log(0.5)=~ -1.505.

m_obs =16.5 + (-1.505) +0 =14.995 ≈15.0.

So m_obs=15.0, which is within both.

So, which stars are detectable by both?

Star1: yes.

Star3: yes (if m_obs=15.5).

Star5: yes.

Wait, but earlier confusion arises because for Star3, the m_obs could be 15.5 or 17.36, depending on whether the given m_obs is intrinsic or observed. The problem says that Star3's apparent V is 15.5, so I think m_obs is 15.5.

So, stars detectable by both:

Star1: yes.

Star3: yes.

Star5: yes.

Wait, but the options in the problem are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, according to our calculation, Star1, Star3, and Star5 can be detected by both. But the options don't include any of these combinations. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine.

Star1: m_obs=15.5. Both can detect.

Star3: if m_obs=15.5, both can detect.

Star5: m_obs=15.0, both can detect.

But the options don't include any option that includes all three. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for Star3.

Wait, perhaps for Star3, the given apparent V is 15.5, but this is the intrinsic (without extinction). So I need to compute m_obs.

So for Star3:

- M_abs = m_obs_intrinsic - distance modulus.

Wait, no, the problem says Star3 has apparent V of 15.5, which is the observed (including extinction). So no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent V is the apparent magnitude without extinction. So the observed (m_obs) would be higher.

Wait, but the problem states that Star3 has apparent V of 15.5. So I think it's the observed.

So back to the stars:

Stars that can be detected by both (m_obs<=16):

Star1: 15.5 → yes.

Star3:15.5 → yes.

Star5:15.0 → yes.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes two of these is B: Star3 and Star5.

But option B says Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both. But wait, according to our calculations, Star1 can also be detected by both.

But the options don't have a choice that includes Star1,3,5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star1.

Star1 has absolute magnitude M=15.5, located at 10 pc.

m_obs = M + distance modulus + Av.

M=15.5, distance modulus=0, Av=0.

So m_obs=15.5.

So both can detect it.

But according to the options, option D is Star1 and Star4. Let's check Star4.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10, E(B-V)=0.4.

Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

m_obs=15.5 +0 +1.24=16.74>16.

So Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So option D is incorrect.

Hmm, so if Star1,3,5 can be detected by both, but the options don't have an option that includes any of these, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 m_obs=16.74, can't be detected by HIRES. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both have m_obs<=16 → correct.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 m_obs=16.5>16 → no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct answer should be B: Star3 and Star5.

But wait, earlier I thought Star3's m_obs is 15.5, so why is Star5 also in the option?

Wait, let's recheck Star5.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

Distance modulus:5 log(5/10)=5 log(0.5)=~ -1.505.

m_obs= M + distance modulus + Av.

Av=0 because E(B-V)=0.

So m_obs=16.5 + (-1.505) +0 =15. So m_obs=15. So yes, both can detect.

So in the options, the only pair that satisfies is Star3 and Star5, which is option B.

Wait, but Star1 can also be detected by both. So why isn't option B including Star1 as well? Oh, perhaps because I'm miscalculating Star3.

Wait, let me reevaluate Star3.

Star3: Apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

If the apparent V is the observed m_obs, then m_obs=15.5, which is <=16 and <=17. So both can detect.

But if the apparent V is the intrinsic (without extinction), then:

m_obs = m_intrinsic + Av =15.5 +1.86=17.36>17 → can't be detected by either.

But the problem says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5. So perhaps that's the observed.

But then why is E(B-V) given?

Wait, perhaps the given apparent V is the absolute magnitude? No, the absolute magnitude is M, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc.

Wait, perhaps the problem is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent V is the absolute magnitude, but no, that doesn't make sense. Because apparent magnitude depends on distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'apparent V magnitude' given is the absolute magnitude, but that would be incorrect terminology.

Another approach: perhaps the 'apparent V magnitude' given for Star3 and Star4 is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we have to compute the observed.

So for Star3:

- M_abs = m_obs (intrinsic) =15.5? No, no. Wait, no, M_abs is the absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude when at 10 pc.

Wait, perhaps the given 'apparent V magnitude' is the apparent magnitude at Earth, including extinction.

So Star3's m_obs=15.5.

So it can be detected by both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But the options don't include any option with all three. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should only consider stars that can be detected by both, which are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps for the question, the apparent V magnitude refers to the absolute magnitude? No, that can't be right. Absolute magnitude is M.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

From our analysis, the correct pair is Star3 (m_obs=15.5) and Star5 (m_obs=15.0), both can be detected by both spectrographs.

So the answer is option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering any extinction effects. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can observe stars up to 16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude \( m_{\text{obs}} \leq 16 \) to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)
- Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)
- Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0 = 0 \)
- Apparent V magnitude:  
  \[
  m_{\text{obs}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 0 + 0 = 15.5
  \]
- \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star1 can be detected by both spectrographs.

#### **Star2**
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.5 \)
- Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0 \), so \( A_V = 0 \)
- \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO.

#### **Star3**
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 \)
- Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \)
- Since the apparent V magnitude is already given as \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 \), it is interpreted as the observed magnitude, which includes extinction.  
- \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star3 can be detected by both spectrographs.

#### **Star4**
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)
- Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)
- Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \)
- Apparent V magnitude:  
  \[
  m_{\text{obs}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]
- \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO.

#### **Star5**
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \)
- Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)
- Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0 \), so \( A_V = 0 \)
- Apparent V magnitude:  
  \[
  m_{\text{obs}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) + A_V = 16.5 + (-1.505) + 0 = 15.0
  \]
- \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.

### Conclusion:
Stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** (\( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 \)) and **Star5** (\( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.0 \)). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
