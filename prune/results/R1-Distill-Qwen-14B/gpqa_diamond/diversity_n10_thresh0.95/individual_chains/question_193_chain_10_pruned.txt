Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance d is approximately 1 divided by the parallax plx in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

Wait, so plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. That means d = 1/plx.

Now, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that: N ∝ 1/plx^5. I can substitute plx with 1/d. So plx = 1/d, so plx^5 would be (1/d)^5 = 1/(d^5).

Substituting that into N: N ∝ 1/(1/d^5) ) => N ∝ d^5. Because 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, like per unit range. So maybe it's about the density or the rate of change. Oh, wait, the number per unit volume or per unit distance?

Wait, no. Because when you look at a region of the sky, the number of stars you can see depends on how far away they are. If the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5, then as distance increases, the number of stars increases with d^5. But that seems counterintuitive because stars are more distant, so maybe fewer should be visible? Or wait, perhaps the question is considering that within a certain volume, so the number increases with a higher density as you look further? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think again. Let's get back to the relation. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d, so 1/plx^
