Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, you're neutralizing the acid. 

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 = 40. 

Wait, I should calculate the concentration after dilution. Oh yeah, using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. So M2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. 

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. I think that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. 

Wait, no, actually, when they say 25% titration, I think they mean 25% of the volume added to reach the equivalence point. Oh wait, no, I'm not sure. Or maybe it's 25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted. Hmm. Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe it's 25% in terms of the volume of NaOH added relative to the equivalence point volume. So I need to find the equivalence point first. 

Let's find the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid initially are M * V. The diluted solution is 0.025 M in 0.04 L, so moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1 between acetic acid and NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence would be 0.001 mol. 

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume (V) = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. 

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. So 25% titration would mean using 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

But wait, 25% of the equivalence point volume is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, only 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. 

So the acetic acid initially is 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 mol. 

The total volume now is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³), which is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). 

So the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M. 

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). 

The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.732. Wait, wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). Oh right, so pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. 

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Approximately 4.26, which looks like option A's first number. 

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. 

Alternatively, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me recalculate the ratio: 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 1/3, so log(1/3) is -0.477. So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So the pH at 25% is around 4.26. 

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, the solution will be basic. 

The concentration of acetate ions: moles are 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid is converted). The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. 

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. 

The concentration is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], which is small compared to 0.02, so:

5.405e-10 ≈ x^2 / 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. 

So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. 

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02 as the equivalence point. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A)4.26; 8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, none of these have 9.02 as the equivalence point. Did I make a mistake? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate. 

Wait, the Kb is Kw over Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct. 

Concentration is 0.02 M for acetate. So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02. So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH] is 1.04e-5. pOH is log(1/(1.04e-5)) → log(9.615e4) ≈ 4.98, so pH is 14 -4.98 ≈ 9.02. Hmm, but the options don't have anything near 9.02. 

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial moles. Let me recheck. 

Original acetic acid: 20 cm³ * 0.05 M = 1 mmol. Wait, no, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Correct. Then diluted with 20 cm³, making 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct. 

At equivalence, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH: 0.01 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Correct. So yes, acetate is 0.001 mol in 50 cm³. So 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct. 

Wait, perhaps the Kb is higher than I thought. Let me recompute Kb. 

Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct. 

Hmm, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(1.081e-11). 

What's 1.081e-11? Let me take the square root. 

The square root of 1.081 is approximately 1.04. Since 1.04^2 is 1.0816. So yes, 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98. pH is 9.02. 

But none of the options have that. So I must have done something wrong. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume when adding NaOH. Let me think. No, the equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of NaOH, which brings the total volume to 40 +10=50 cm³. 

Wait, another thought. Maybe the problem doesn't use the exact Ka but an approximate one. Let me check the pKa again. 

Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa is around 4.73. Correct. 

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution at equivalence is acetate, which is a weak base, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately using the exact expression. 

Let me set up the equation again:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial concentrations: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M, [CH3COOH] = 0, [OH^-]=0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 - x, x, x.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = x^2/(0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is ~1.04e-5. 

So pOH is log(1.04e5) → no, wait, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) = 4.98 (since log(1.04) is ~0.017, so 5-0.017=4.983). pH=14-4.983=9.017, so about 9.02. 

But none of the options have pH near 9. So I must have messed up somewhere. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the question is not asking for the equivalence point but the pH? Hmm, no, the question says, what's the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, looking at the options, option D has 4.57 and 6.92. Option A has 4.26 and 8.52. But our equivalence point is way higher, 9.02, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait another possibility: Maybe the total volume at equivalence is not 50 cm³? Let me check. 

The initial solution is 40 cm³. Then, adding 10 cm³ NaOH, total is 50 cm³. Correct. 

Wait, perhaps the problem actually asks for the pH when 25% of the solution is neutralized, not 25% of the equivalence point. Wait, 25% of the equivalence point in terms of NaOH volume. Hmm, but that's how I did it.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recheck. 

Original acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Diluted with 20 cm³ water, so 40 cm³ total. So 0.001 mol in 0.04 L → 0.025 M. Correct. 

At equivalence, 0.001 mol NaOH is added. So the moles of acetate are 0.001. 

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution at equivalence is sodium acetate, which is a salt, and its pH can be found by considering hydrolysis. So the pH should be higher than 7. But the options have some equivalence points around 8.52, 6.73, 7, or 6.92. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Kb. Let me recalculate it.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct. 

Wait, maybe the initial assumption that x is small is incorrect? Let me check x. 

x is 1.04e-5, which is much smaller than 0.02. So the assumption holds. 

Hmm, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Maybe the problem is considering that the equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. But perhaps I messed up the calculation of moles. 

Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 0.001 mol, correct. So 0.001 mol of NaOH at 0.1 M would require 0.01 L or 10 cm³, correct. 

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH at equivalence point again. 

Another approach: At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate. The pH can be found using the formula for a weak base:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - log C)

Wait, pKa is 4.73, pKw is 14. So ½ (4.73 +14 - log(0.02)). 

Log(0.02) is log(2e-2) = log(2) + log(1e-2) → 0.301 -2 = -1.699. 

So ½ (18.73 - (-1.699)) → ½ (20.429) )= 10.2145. But wait, that's not matching either, because that would give a pH of around 10.21, which is even higher. 

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for pH when you have a salt of a weak acid and strong base is pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - log C) ). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. 

Alternatively, for acetate, which is a weak base, the pH can be found using:

pOH = pKa_acid + log ( [A^- ] / [HA] )

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for a weak base is pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - log C). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the exact expression for Kb. Let's try that.

The Kb expression is Kb = x^2/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10. 

Assume x is small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → [OH-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH ≈ 4.98 → pH ≈9.02.

But that's not matching any option. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the volume calculations. Let me check. 

The initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Then, the equivalence requires 10 cm³ of NaOH, making total 50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct. 

Wait, maybe the Ka was given as 1.85e-5, but I should compute the pKa precisely. Let me compute pKa more accurately. 

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = - log(1.85e-5) → log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733 → pKa=4.733. Correct. 

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should consider the solution at equivalence point as a buffer? No, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so it's just the acetate ion in solution. 

Another thought: Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration. Let me see. At 25% of the equivalence point, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So the moles of acetic acid reacted would be 0.00025 mol. 

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. So remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 mol, and acetate is 0.00025 mol. The total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are [HA]=0.00075/0.0425= ~0.017647 M; [A-] = 0.00025/0.0425= ~0.005882 M. 

So pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) → 4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647) → log(0.333) → -0.477. So pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So the first part is 4.26, which matches option A's first value. 

But the equivalence point is giving me a pH around 9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. 

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the Kb. Let me do it again. 

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Yes, correct. 

Wait, what if the concentration is not 0.02 M? Let me check again. 

Moles of acetate at equivalence: 0.001 mol. Volume is 50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct. 

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact expression without the approximation. Let me set up the equation:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Let me compute x with the exact equation. 

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. Then x^2 =5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5. So pOH is about 4.98, pH≈9.02. 

But the options don't have this. Hmm. 

Wait, let me look at the options again. The options for equivalence point are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B),7 (C), 6.92 (D). So none of them are near 9. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the dilution part was done incorrectly. Let me recheck that. 

We diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is being diluted with 20 cm³ of water, but perhaps the NaOH is added to this solution. So when I add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³. Correct. 

Wait, maybe I should calculate the exact pH at equivalence using the formula for a weak base. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is being considered as a buffer even at equivalence, but that's not the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH at the equivalence point using the formula for sodium acetate. Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact method, without approximation.

So Kb =5.405e-10, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M. 

The equation is x^2 / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10. Let me assume x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02 → x≈sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 → pH is 9.02. 

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the initial problem is to find the pH at 25% of the acid's neutralization, but not 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: The equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. 25% titration may refer to 25% of the acid's moles neutralized. So, if the acid is 0.001 mol, 25% is 0.00025 mol. So same as before, 25% of the moles neutralized. So same calculation, pH is 4.26. 

But the equivalence point is 9.02, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the mistake is that I used the initial moles of acetic acid wrong. 

Wait, let me recalculate the initial moles of acetic acid. 

20 cm³ is 0.02 L, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L → 0.02 *0.05=0.001 mol. Correct. 

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. 

The options are:

A)4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, perhaps the pH at equivalence point is 8.52, which is option A's second value. So how do I get 8.52?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider the solution at equivalence point as a buffer of acetate and acetic acid, but that's not the case. 

Wait, another possibility: I might have the initial concentration wrong. Let me double-check the initial concentration after dilution. 

Original acetic acid volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ water, volume is 40 cm³. So M = (0.05 *20) /40 = (1)/40 = 0.025 M. Correct. 

Wait, maybe I should do the equivalence point calculation using the exact formula without the assumption that x is negligible. Let me try that.

Set up Kb equation: x^2 / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is not negligible. Let's solve the quadratic equation.

x^2 =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x) → x^2 =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to one side: x^2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 +4ac)]/(2a). Here a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 + 4 *1*1.081e-11 → (2.92e-19) +4.324e-11 → approx 4.324e-11. 

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= ~6.575e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±6.575e-6 ] /2. 

We take the positive root, so x≈(6.575e-6)/2 ≈3.287e-6. 

So [OH-]=3.287e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514. Which is approximately 8.51, close to 8.52. So the equivalence point is about 8.52, matching option A's second value. 

Ah! So earlier, I assumed x was small, but perhaps it's not entirely negligible, leading to a higher pH. So at equivalence, pH is approximately 8.52. 

So, combining the two results, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence point it's approximately 8.52. So the correct option would be A. 

But wait, earlier when I assumed x was negligible, I got x=~1.04e-5, leading to pH ~9.02. But when I do the quadratic, I get pH ~8.52. So perhaps the assumption that x is small was incorrect, and the quadratic method gives a better approximation. 

So now, the pH at equivalence is 8.52, matching option A. 

So, putting it all together:

At 25% titration: pH ≈4.26.

At equivalence: pH≈8.52.

So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the dilution of acetic acid and then determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid
The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.02}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M \cdot V = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of NaOH required at equivalence are also 0.001 mol. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:

\[
V = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

At equivalence, the total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The solution at equivalence point is basic because acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. The pH is calculated using the hydrolysis of acetate:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies [OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH at equivalence is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, none of the options match this value. To resolve this, we solve the quadratic equation for \( [OH^-] \) without approximations:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02 - x} = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 5.405 \times 10^{-10}x - 1.081 \times 10^{-11} = 0 \), we find:

\[
x \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.486 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

### Step 3: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \cdot 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \)) are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.50 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52. Thus, the correct option is:
