Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and think through what I know.

The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. So, the star's properties change when spots are present, and that affects the temperature, which in turn affects the population of these energy levels.

First, the star's parameters: when there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait—does the presence of spots lower the effective temperature? I think that's because the spots are cooler regions. So the observed Teff is an average of the spotted and unspotted areas, weighted by their coverage.

But how does that affect the photosphere? Oh, right, the photosphere's temperature changes, which affects the ionization and excitation of atoms. The problem is about the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels. So we're dealing with the Saha equation and Boltzmann equation, probably.

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, E_i and E_j are the energies of levels i and j, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), this holds. So when the temperature changes, the ratio changes exponentially with T. But wait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall T decreases. So let's think.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Hmm, that's in the ultraviolet range. Wait, but whether the transition is allowed or forbidden isn't directly relevant here, perhaps. The important part is that the energy difference between the two levels is such that the transition wavelength is 1448 Å. So we can compute the energy difference (ΔE) from the wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ. So, let's compute ΔE for the transition. But do we need the exact value, or can we use ratios?

Wait, the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio (n1/n2) changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. So we need (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Each ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1 (assuming level 2 is higher, since the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so E2 > E1). Or wait, actually, if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 > E1. So when you go from level 1 to 2, it's an absorption line. But the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ), because the Boltzmann distribution is n_i proportional to g_i exp( -E_i/(kT) ). So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(kT) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

Wait, let me clarify. The energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. So ΔE = E2 - E1.

Boltzmann factor for level i: exp( -E_i/(k T) ). So the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio (n1/n2) decreases because we're taking exp of a more negative number, making it smaller. But wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Because the Teff is lower, so T is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, the problem states that when spots are present, the observed ratio decreases. So, without spots, ratio is higher. The factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots).

So the factor is [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) ) ]

The g1 and g2 terms cancel out, so the factor is exp[ (ΔE/k)(1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots) ]

Wait wait, let me re-derive that. The ratio without spots is (n1/n2)_no = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_no) )

The ratio with spots is (n1/n2)_spots = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) )

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_spots = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_no) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) ) ]

= exp [ (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no) ) ]

Wait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract. So it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_spots) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no) ) )

Wait, T_spots is 5500 K, T_no is 6000 K.

So (1/T_spots) is approximately 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1, and (1/T_no) is 1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4 K^-1.

So 1/T_spots - 1/T_no = (1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4) = (approx) 0.151e-4 K^-1.

So the exponent is (ΔE / k) * (0.151e-4 )

But wait, what is ΔE? Let me compute that.

ΔE = hc / λ, where λ is 1448 Å. Let's compute in ergs. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-27 erg s. Speed of light c is 3e10 cm/s. Wavelength λ is 1448 Å = 1448e-8 cm.

So ΔE = (6.626e-27 erg s)(3e10 cm/s) / (1448e-8 cm )

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-27 *3e10 = 1.9878e-16 erg cm

Denominator: 1448e-8 cm = 1.448e-5 cm

So ΔE = 1.9878e-16 / 1.448e-5 = approx 1.373e-11 erg per photon.

But wait, 1 erg is 1e-7 joules. But perhaps it's easier to work in terms of eV because k is known in eV.

Wait, k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K. And 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So let me compute ΔE in eV.

E_photon = hc / λ. Let me use cgs units to compute E in erg.

h=6.626e-27 erg s, c=3e10 cm/s. λ=1448 A = 1448e-8 cm.

So E_photon = (6.626e-27 erg s * 3e10 cm/s) / (1448e-8 cm) = (1.9878e-16 erg cm) / (1.448e-5 cm) = 1.9878e-16 / 1.448e-5 = approx 1.373e-11 erg.

Convert erg to eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-12 erg. So E_photon = 1.373e-11 erg / 1.602e-12 erg/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's a big number. Hmm. Because 1448 Å is in the near UV, so the energy is around 8.5 eV. I think that's correct because visible light is about 1.5-3 eV.

So ΔE is about 8.57 eV per photon. Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, we have ΔE/(k T), where k is in eV/K.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the units. ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, which is the same as the photon's energy. So I can use that as the value for ΔE.

So, for T_no = 6000 K and T_spots =5500 K.

So, the exponent is (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no)

Compute (1/T_spots - 1/T_no) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(3.3e7) ) = approx 1.515e-5 1/K.

Wait, let me calculate that exactly.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000≈0.000166667.

Subtracting, 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151.

Which is 1.5151e-5 1/K.

So (1/T_spots - 1/T_no) = 1.515e-5 1/K.

Now, ΔE is 8.57 eV. k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/k = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99,400 K.

So ΔE/k ≈ 99,400 K.

Multiply this by (1.515e-5 1/K):

99,400 * 1.515e-5 = 99,400 * 0.00001515 ≈ let's compute that.

99,400 * 0.000015 = 99,400 * 1.5e-5 = (approx 99,400 * 1.5) *1e-5.

99,400 *1.5= 149,100.

149,100 *1e-5 = 1.491.

But wait, that's 0.000015. The actual value is 0.00001515, so 0.000015 is 1.5e-5, and 0.00001515 is 1.515e-5.

So 99,400 * 1.515e-5 = 99,400 * 0.00001515.

Compute 99,400 * 0.00001515.

First, 99,400 * 0.00001 = 0.994.

Then, 99,400 * 0.00000515 = ?

99,400 * 5.15e-6 = (99,400 *5.15) *1e-6.

99,400 *5 is 497,000.

99,400 *0.15 = 14,910.

So 497,000 +14,910 = 511,910.

Multiply by 1e-6: 511,910 *1e-6 = 0.51191.

So 0.994 + 0.51191 = 1.50591.

Approximately 1.506.

So the exponent is approximately 1.506.

So the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

What's e^1.5? e^1 is 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.6487.

So e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^1.506 is a bit higher. Let's compute 1.506-1.5=0.006.

e^0.006 ≈ 1.00603.

So 4.4817 * 1.00603 ≈ 4.51.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, the calculation gives about 4.5, which matches option C.

So the ratio without spots is about 4.5 times higher than when spots are present. So the factor is 4.5.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots to having spots. The key is to use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels to temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations is:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into the factor expression and canceling \(g_1/g_2\), we get:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the photon energy for a transition with wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{erg·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s}\), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-27})(3 \times 10^{10})}{1448 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{erg}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-11}}{1.602 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\)
The temperatures are \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\). Calculating:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
Using \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\), the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

First, compute \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now multiply by \(1.515 \times 10^{-5}\):

\[
99,400 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.506.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
