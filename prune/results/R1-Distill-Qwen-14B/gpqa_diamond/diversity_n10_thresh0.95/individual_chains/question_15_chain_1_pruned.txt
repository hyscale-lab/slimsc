Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things because eccentricity isn't a factor here.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But despite that, both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. Usually, more massive stars are larger, but maybe Planet_2's host is a subgiant or something, so it's slightly evolved but same size as Planet_1's host.

We're to determine which planet has a higher transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. But wait, another factor is the inclination of the orbit. For a transit to occur, the orbit must be edge-on relative to us. The probability is higher if the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned with our line of sight.

Wait, another thing: the transit probability also depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, and the distance of the planet's orbit. The formula for the probability of transit is something like (R_planet / R_star) squared multiplied by something else. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Oh right, the transit probability (P) can be approximated as (R_p / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just R_p / a. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

The transit probability formula I recall is P = (R_p / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)), but since e=0 for both, it's just R_p / a. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. No, that can't be right. Wait, the transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. So the probability is the area of the star's disk relative to the area of the planet's orbit. So the probability is (R_star / a)^2, but considering that the planet's orbit is a circle, and we're looking for the chance that the line of sight intersects the disk.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The transit probability is the fraction of the orbit where the planet is in front of the star. For a circular orbit, this is (R_star / a), because the planet must be within the star's apparent size in the sky. So the probability P is approximately (R_star / a), assuming that the orbital plane is edge-on. But wait, the actual probability depends on the inclination of the orbit. For a random inclination, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, multiplied by some geometric factor.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is P = (R_s / a) * (1 / (1 + (m_p / M_s)^(1/3)) ) ), but that might be for Doppler shifts. Hmm, perhaps I should get back to basics.

The transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, that's the formula for the probability of detecting a planet via the transit method, considering the Doppler method has already found the planet. Oh wait, I'm getting confused between the transit method and the radial velocity method.

Wait, in this case, both planets have already been detected via the RV method, meaning that their masses are known. But for transiting, the probability depends on the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the general transit probability for a planet is: P = (R_star / a) * (R_star / a) * (something). No, perhaps it's more about the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by (something about the inclination). Or maybe it's the area of the star divided by the area of the planet's orbit, but that would be (π R_star²) / (π a²) ) = (R_s / a)^2. But that's for the area, but the probability is a line of sight effect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis (a) of the planet's orbit. Because for a circular orbit, the planet must be within the star's apparent size in the sky for a transit to happen. So the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability (for a circular orbit) is given by:

P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_star / a))⁻¹ ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look up the formula. Oh wait, in the context of the question, the probability of transit is the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)))

Wait,
