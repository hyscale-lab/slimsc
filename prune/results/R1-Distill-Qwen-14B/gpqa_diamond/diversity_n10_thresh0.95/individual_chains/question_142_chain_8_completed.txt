Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (i.e., a statistical mixture of pure states) rather than pure. 

First, I need to figure out what this matrix looks like. Let's break it down. The |0><0| term is a projector onto the state |0>, which, in matrix form, is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the first position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 1 in the second position. So when I add these two matrices, I get a 2x2 matrix with both diagonal elements as 1. Multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 0.5, and the off-diagonal elements remain zero. So the density matrix ρ is:

[ [0.5, 0],
  [0, 0.5] ]

Wait, but how does this relate to the geometrical position in qubit space? Hmm, I think I need to represent this density matrix as a point in some space. Oh right, for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. But wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, and density matrices represent mixed states. How does that work?

I remember that any density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector), and σ represents the Pauli matrices. So let's write that out.

The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Which is (I)/2 because |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2. 

Comparing this to the general form, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. Because when you subtract I/2 from both sides, you get (r·σ)/2 = 0, so r·σ = 0. 

What does r·σ equal to zero mean? The Pauli matrices σ are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So the dot product would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this sum to be zero matrix, each coefficient must be zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z all have to be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). 

So the geometrical position is at the origin in the Bloch sphere. But wait, how does that make sense? The Bloch sphere includes the origin? No, wait, the origin is the completely mixed state. Because the identity matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state for a qubit, which is the maximally uncertain state. So in this case, since ρ is (I/2), it's the maximally mixed state, which is represented by r=0. 

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a single qubit, the Bloch representation of a density matrix is given by 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), we see that the term \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) must vanish, which implies \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). 

This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is 

\[
r = (0, 0, 0).
\]

Answer: C
