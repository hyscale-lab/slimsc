Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the value of 'a' given the wave function of a particle in a tube. 

Hmm, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second—wave functions in quantum mechanics usually have to satisfy certain conditions, right? Like, they need to be normalizable. Oh right, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But wait, the problem says that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function is zero outside this region, and only exists between x=1 and x=3. But wait, the given wave function doesn't look like a function that's zero outside a certain region. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. No, the wave function here is given for the region where the particles exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside of that, the wave function is zero. So the given expression is valid for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere.

But the wave function needs to be normalized. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because outside that range, the wave function is zero, so it doesn't contribute to the integral.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3. Wait, but wait, the square of the absolute value is [ψ*(x) * ψ(x)]. Since ψ(x) is a complex function, the absolute square is ψ*(x) multiplied by ψ(x), right?

Let me write ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So ψ*(x) * ψ(x) would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5i)^2 + cross terms. Wait, no, because (a + b)(a - b) would be a² - b² when b is imaginary. But wait, when you multiply (a - ib)(a + ib), it's a² + b², because the imaginary parts cancel out. So in this case, the absolute square would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

Wait, because (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) multiplied by (a/sqrt(1+x) +0.5i) equals (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because the cross terms (the i terms) would cancel out. So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx equals 1. Because the wave function is zero outside and the probability is normalized.

So let's compute this integral. The integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3 is equal to a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus 0.25 times the integral of 1 dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C. So from 1 to 3, it's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). 

The integral of 1 dx from 1 to 3 is 2, since 3-1=2.

So putting it together, the integral becomes a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2. This must equal 1.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

I can calculate that. Ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is about 0.7204.

Then a squared is approximately 0.7204, so a is the square root of that, which is around 0.8485. Now, looking at the options, option B is 0.85. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

So 0.85 is option B. Hmm, but wait, I thought the result was approximately 0.8485, which rounds to 0.85. So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I make any mistake?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So its absolute square is [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2, because when you multiply (a - ib)(a + ib), it's a² + b². So that part is correct.

Integral from 1 to3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to3. As before, that's a² ln(2) = a² * 0.6931.

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(2) = 0.5.

So the sum is a² * 0.6931 + 0.5 =1.

So a² = (1-0.5)/0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7204.

a = sqrt(0.7204) ≈ 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is correct.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by ensuring the wave function is normalized. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3,
\]

and it is zero outside this range. Normalization requires that the total probability is 1, so:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral splits into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx\).  
   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Evaluating from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

   Therefore, the first term becomes:

   \[
   a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx\).  
   The integral of \(0.25\) over \(x=1\) to \(x=3\) is:

   \[
   0.25 \times (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7204.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7204} \approx 0.8485.
\]

This value rounds to \(a \approx 0.85\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**B) 0.85.**
