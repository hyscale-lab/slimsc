Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, Li is lithium, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 since it has 3 neutrons (Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6).

Wait, the problem says "X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons." Oh, so that's Li-6. Got it. So I need to calculate the total energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light.

I remember from my physics classes that the total energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First, I should find the velocity v, which is 0.96c. So plugging that in, let's compute gamma.

Let me calculate v squared over c squared first. (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c², so v²/c² = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think, sqrt(0.0784) is approximately 0.28. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Right. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1. So yes, that's right.

Wait, but wait, more accurately, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28 because 28^2 is 784, so 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Or maybe exactly 3.5714286? Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let me think, 0.28 * 3.5714 = 1.000000. So yes, 3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy, but for rough calculations, sometimes people approximate it as the sum of the individual nucleons.

Wait, but wait, the exact mass might be easier to get from the periodic table. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0160 g/mol. But wait, I need the rest mass energy in GeV.

Wait, the atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c². So to find the rest mass energy, I'll take the mass in u, multiply by 931.5 MeV/u, then convert to GeV.

Li-6 has a molar mass of about 6.0160 g/mol. Wait, no, that's atomic mass. So 1 mole has 6.0160 grams. So the mass of a single nucleus is 6.0160 / Avogadro's number grams. But since I'm using the atomic mass unit, which is 1 g/mol approximately, wait, no. The atomic mass unit is defined such that 1 u = 1 g/mol / (Avogadro's number * 1000), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) times the number of nucleons.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So let me calculate the total rest mass.

So protons: 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV. Neutrons: 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV. Sum is 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. So 5.633511 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's the sum of individual nucleons. However, the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum because of binding energy. So the mass defect is the energy released when the nucleus forms. But wait, in this case, the rest mass of the nucleus would be (sum of individual masses) minus the mass defect. Hmm, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the question expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses as the rest mass. Or maybe I should use the exact atomic mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is given by the atomic mass in u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u. So let's check. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0160 u. So 6.0160 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Wait, 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.0160 * 931.5 = approximately 14.904 MeV. So total is 5589 +14.904 = 5603.904 MeV, which is 5.603904 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I summed each nucleon, I got about 5.6335 GeV, so there's a discrepancy. That's because the actual mass of Li-6 is less than the sum due to binding energy. So using the atomic mass is more accurate.

So I think using the atomic mass is better here. So Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.0160 u. So 6.0160 * 931.5 = let's compute that.

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.0160 * 931.5 = 14.904 MeV. So adding them gives 5603.904 MeV, which is 5.603904 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.6039 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is about 3.5714.

So E = gamma * m_rest c² = 3.5714 * 5.6039 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.6039.

Hmm, 3 times 5.6039 is 16.8117. 0.5714 *5.6039.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.6039 is 2.801
