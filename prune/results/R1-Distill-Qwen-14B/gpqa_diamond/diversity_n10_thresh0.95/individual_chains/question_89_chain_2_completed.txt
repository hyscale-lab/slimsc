Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's give it a shot.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is around where esters or maybe ketones show up. Wait, but if it's KOH and dibromide, probably elimination is happening. So maybe it's a double elimination. Oh wait, dibromide with strong base—could be dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But IR at 1720, that's more likely an ester or a carbonyl group. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation? Or perhaps it's an epoxide? No, wait, KOH isn't typical for epoxidation. Alternatively, maybe it's eliminating to form a diene or a ketone? Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH could lead to elimination, forming a double bond. But 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl, so maybe it's an E2 elimination forming a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the reaction is more of a ring-opening. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane is like having two Brs across from each other in the diamond structure.

Heating with KOH might lead to a ring-opening. Oh, wait, maybe it's a base-induced elimination to form an alkene. But then, the product's IR shows a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. No, KOH as a base is more for elimination. Wait, but KOH could also act as a nucleophile. Let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH—maybe two elimination steps? So each Br is removed, forming two new bonds. Wait, but where would the hydroxide attack?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is similar to the formation of an epoxide. Wait, no, that's done with peracids. Hmm. Wait, another thought: if you have two bromides, perhaps in a vicinal dihalide. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would be a 1,3-dihalide. Heating with KOH would likely cause elimination of HBr twice, forming a diene. But wait, that doesn't explain the IR at 1720. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe it's a neighboring group participation? Or perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening to form a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, the product is a solid, and the IR shows a carbonyl. Let me think about the structure. If two eliminations happen, maybe each elimination forms a double bond, but that would lead to a diene. But where would the carbonyl come from? Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution of Br with OH, but then the product would have hydroxyl groups, and the IR would show O-H stretches around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹. But the given IR is 1720, which is more like an ester or a ketone.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a two-step elimination, where each Br is removed, but in a way that forms a carbonyl. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by another, but in a way that forms a ketone. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the Corey–Bakshi–Shibata reduction? No, that's for ketones to alkanes. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more of a ring-opening elimination, forming a carbonyl group. If the adamantane structure is opened, maybe the product is a diketone or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, but KOH wouldn't typically make an epoxide. Epoxides form via peracids or other oxidizing agents. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the 1H NMR of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm peak is probably a CH₂ group. The 2.41-2.23 region is likely CH₂ groups in a rigid structure, perhaps the adamantane carbons. The 1.94 could be another CH₂ group. Wait, but how does this fit with elimination?

Wait, another approach: maybe the product is an ester. If KOH is the base, but in excess, perhaps it's a saponification reaction, but that would produce a carboxylate. Hmm, but the IR at 1720 might be an ester (C=O stretch). But then why would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form an ester upon heating with KOH? That seems unclear.

Wait, perhaps it's a Grignard reaction. But KOH isn't a Grignard reagent. Alternatively, maybe the dibromide is undergoing a coupling reaction, but I don't see how KOH would facilitate that.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form an alkene. Let's say the product is 1,3-adamantadiene or something. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the product's structure more carefully. The IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group, so maybe it's an ester or ketone. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where Br is replaced by OH, but that would produce a diol. But then, the IR should have O-H stretches, which are usually strong and broad. The problem states the IR has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, so maybe it's not a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide. Wait, but I thought KOH doesn't make epoxides. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product isn't an epoxide but a ketone. How? Maybe the elimination forms a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's a case of oxidative elimination. If each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH₂ group, perhaps elimination would form a double bond, but wait, how would that lead to a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening epoxidation, but that doesn't seem right with KOH.

Hmm, perhaps I should move to the next step and see if that gives me any clues. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, maybe for Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl group. If product 1 is an ester, then heating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some kind of acylation reaction. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of aldol condensation, but that usually requires a base.

Wait, product 2 is then subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That sounds like ozonolysis. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would be the result of cleaving a double bond in product 2.

Putting it all together: Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heated with KOH to form product 1 (which has a carbonyl), then product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2, which has a double bond (so that ozonolysis can act on it), leading to product 3, which would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

Wait, so perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let me think again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps a double elimination occurs, forming a double bond and maybe a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused. The 1 and 3 positions are across from each other. So when KOH is used, perhaps it's causing a ring-opening elimination. If two HBr molecules are eliminated, what would that form?

Wait, if you have two adjacent Br atoms, elimination would form a double bond. But in adamantane, the structure is rigid, so if two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. But then product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But then the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm⁻¹ for the double bond, not 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. If each Br is replaced by OH, you get a diol. But then the IR would have O-H stretches, which are broad and strong. The given IR is at 1720, which isn't matching. So substitution doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with a different leaving group. But the starting material has Br as leaving groups. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination where each Br leaves, but that seems like two eliminations would be needed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a double elimination to form an epoxide. But that would require a peracid, not KOH. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. But how? 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH... unless it's a nucleophilic substitution with OH- but esterification usually needs an acid catalyst.

Wait, maybe the product is a gem-diol, but that's when two OH groups are on the same carbon. But then the IR would show O-H. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Let me think: if each Br is on a carbon that is next to a CH2 group, elimination could form a carbonyl group. So, for example, each Br is on a CH2Br, and elimination would form a CO group. So two eliminations would form two carbonyls. But that would make a diepoxide or a diketone?

Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl, but that's a bit unclear. If product 1 is a diketone, maybe something like cyclohexanedione. But the NMR would have different peaks.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm is a doublet (2H) which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. The 2.41-2.23 ppm is a multiplet integrating for 10H, which could be the adamantane carbons. The 1.94 ppm is a doublet (2H), perhaps another CH2 group. If product 1 is an ester, the structure might be something like an adamantyl group attached to an ester oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diether, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a Dieckmann condensation, which forms a cyclic ester. But that requires an intramolecular esterification, which would need a β-keto ester or similar. I don't see how 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form that.

Wait, maybe the first step is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. But how would that lead to a carbonyl in the IR? Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, there's some oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester formed via a substitution reaction where each Br is replaced by an O-R group, but again, I'm not sure how that would happen with KOH.

Wait, maybe I should move to the next step. Product 1 is reacted with Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Al isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions, which introduce acyl groups into aromatic rings. But wait, product 1 doesn't seem to be an aromatic compound. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps Al isopropoxide helps in some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is an ester, then Al isopropoxide can act as a catalyst for esterification or transesterification. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide is used in some kind of elimination reaction to form an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene. Then, when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, it would break into carbonyl groups.

So putting it all together: 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH to form a diol (product 1), which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide undergoes elimination to form an alkene (product 2). Then, ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups in product 3.

But wait, the IR of product 1 would show O-H if it's a diol, but the IR given is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. How? If the reaction forms a ketone via elimination, maybe a cyclic ketone. But then, how?

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. Let's imagine that each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br. Eliminating both HBr molecules could form a carbonyl group. For example, if you have CH2Br-CH2Br, eliminating both HBr would give O=C=O, but that's not applicable here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure after elimination is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the first step. Maybe I should think about the ozonolysis part. Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2, which is treated with O3 at -78°C and then dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 1 must have some functional group that, when reacted with Al isopropoxide, forms a double bond.

Wait, Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. But if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps Al isopropoxide helps in forming an enol, which can undergo some alkylation or similar. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester, and Al isopropoxide is used to form an acylium ion, which can then react.

Wait, let me think about product 2. If product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 after ozonolysis would have carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 would show signals corresponding to these carbonyl-adjacent hydrogens.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding those that exchange. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would be near an electronegative group, perhaps a carbonyl. In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved into two carbonyl groups. Depending on the structure of product 2, the resulting product 3 could have different coupling patterns.

Wait, let's reconstruct:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl, IR 1720) → product 2 (with double bond, formed via Al isopropoxide) → product 3 (after ozonolysis, cleaving double bond into two carbonyls).

So product 2 must have a double bond. How does product 1 become product 2 with a double bond?

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps Al isopropoxide is used to form an enol, which then can undergo some elimination to form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester, and Al isopropoxide induces a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, but earlier steps don't seem to support that.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide induces elimination to form a double bond. So product 2 would be an alkene, and product 3 would be two carbonyls.

But earlier, I thought product 1's IR doesn't match a diol. But wait, maybe the diol is an acetal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, which is less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Let's say product 1 is an ester, like adamantyl acetate. Then, Al isopropoxide could act as a catalyst for some reaction, perhaps forming an acylium ion, which could then undergo elimination to form a double bond. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is either an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe a carboxylic acid (but that would have a broad O-H stretch as well, which isn't mentioned). So carboxylic acid is less likely. Aldehyde would have a peak around 2820 (stretching) and 2720 (the aldehyde proton), which isn't mentioned. So product 1 is probably an ester or ketone.

If product 1 is a ketone, then Al isopropoxide could help in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but product 1 doesn't seem to be aromatic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and Al isopropoxide induces some kind of ring-opening to form a double bond. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is an enol ether, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide undergoes some elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is a conjugated diene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the diene into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the possible structures.

1. Starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

2. Reaction with KOH gives product 1, which has a carbonyl group (IR 1720). So product 1 is likely an ester or ketone.

3. Product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2 (which has a double bond, as product 3 is from ozonolysis).

4. Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3, which has carbonyl groups.

So, product 2 must be an alkene. How does product 1 (carbonyl) become product 2 (alkene)?

One possibility is that product 1 is a ketone, and Al isopropoxide is used in a elimination reaction to form an alkene. For example, if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, perhaps Al isopropoxide helps in a ring-opening elimination to form a double bond.

Alternatively, product 1 is an ester, and Al isopropoxide is used to form an acylium ion, which can then undergo elimination.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is an ester with a structure that allows for the formation of an enol, which can then eliminate to form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide induces elimination to form an alkene. But again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ester, an epoxide, but earlier that didn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a nucleophilic substitution where two OH groups are added, but that gives a diol, which as discussed earlier, doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a double elimination, forming a ketone. So, each Br is on a CH2 group, and elimination forms a carbonyl group. So, product 1 is a ketone.

Then, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide. Maybe Al isopropoxide helps in a rearrangement or elimination to form a double bond. For example, if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, perhaps it undergoes ring-opening to form an alkene. Or perhaps it's a non-cyclic ketone that undergoes some elimination.

Wait, another angle: the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen (as in an ether or ester). The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably the adamantane's CH2 groups, and 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group. So perhaps product 1 is an ester with a structure where an adamantyl group is attached to an ester oxygen.

If product 1 is an ester, then Al isopropoxide, being a Lewis acid, could facilitate the formation of an acylium ion, which could undergo some reaction, perhaps elimination, to form a double bond. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 (an alkene) would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded would be near the carbonyl group. In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each side becomes a carbonyl. So, if the original double bond is in a symmetric position, the resulting product would have two identical carbonyl groups. But considering the adamantane structure, it's possible that the ozonolysis produces a pair of carbonyl groups that are each attached to two CH2 groups.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is an alkene in the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl would be attached to two CH2 groups, perhaps.

Looking at product 3's NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to the carbonyl group. These hydrogens would be on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens.

If each CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each hydrogen would be split by two neighboring hydrogens (like a triplet). Wait, but each CH2 could be adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to splitting into a triplet.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the cleavage is between the two carbons of the double bond. So each carbonyl would be attached to the original carbons that were part of the double bond. So, if the original structure was a trans double bond, for example, the resulting carbonyl groups would each have adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, considering that the original product 2 is an alkene within the adamantane structure, the ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Each of these would have neighboring CH2 groups, and perhaps each CH2 is next to another CH2 group.

So, the hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl would be on CH2 groups. Each of these CH2 groups would have two neighboring hydrogens (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

Wait, but if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each H would be coupled with two Hs on each neighboring group. Wait, no, each H on a CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on the same CH2 and maybe another two on the adjacent CH2. Hmm, no, wait.

Wait, each H on a CH2 next to a carbonyl would be next to another CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and possibly one or more Hs on the neighboring CH2. Wait, but the splitting would be a triplet for each neighboring group.

Wait, in vicinal coupling, each H on a CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighbors, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent group is another CH2, then each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, each of which has two Hs. So that would make each H split into a triplet of triplets. Or perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Wait, no, let me think again. Coupling between two adjacent CH2 groups: each H on the first CH2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the same CH2 (so that's a triplet from this), and also couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have a total of 2 (same CH2) + 2 (adjacent CH2) neighbors, but in reality, the coupling is only through the adjacent CH2, so each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, each H on CH2A would couple with the two Hs on CH2B. So each H on CH2A would see two neighboring Hs (from CH2B), each of which has a coupling constant J. So each H would split into a triplet. But wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps each H on CH2A is coupled with each H on CH2B, which are two in number. So each H on CH2A would split into a triplet (from CH2B), and each H on CH2B would split into a triplet from CH2A.

But wait, in reality, each H on CH2A is coupled with two Hs on CH2B, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, and each of those is adjacent to another CH2, leading to more coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, and each has two neighboring Hs. So the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each be split by two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (so a triplet), but they might also be split by another set of Hs, leading to a more complex pattern.

Wait, but in the context of the options, the choices are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, and pentet. So the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Let's say each of these Hs is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet. But if there's another coupling, perhaps with another CH2 group further away, it could lead to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and one H on the other, it could lead to a triplet, or perhaps more.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a situation where each CH2 group is adjacent to two others, leading to more splitting. For example, if the CH2 is between two other CH2 groups, each H could be coupled with four Hs (two on each neighbor), but that would make a quintet (pentet). But that doesn't fit the options given. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me think of a simple example. If a hydrogen is next to two Hs on one CH2 and another two Hs on another CH2, it would be coupled with two groups of two Hs each. So the splitting would first split into a triplet (from the first two Hs), and each of those would split again into a triplet (from the second two Hs), leading to a triplet of triplets. So that would be option B.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs and also another two Hs, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a doublet of triplets. Let's consider: each H is coupled with two Hs from one direction (triplet) and two from another, but perhaps the coupling constants are different, leading to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H is coupled with two Hs (from the same CH2, giving a triplet) and also with two Hs from the next CH2, but that would again be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is next to another CH2, which is next to another CH2. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet), and also with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, the coupling constants between different groups vary. If the two couplings (from adjacent groups) have similar J values, the splitting could be more complex. But in the options, B is triplet of triplets, which would fit this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is a doublet of triplets, but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, maybe it's a pentet. If each H is coupled with four Hs, like two on each side, that would give a quintet (five peaks). But I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of a similar problem. Ozonolysis of a diene leads to two carbonyl groups. The Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be on CH2 groups. If these CH2 groups are each adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on both adjacent groups. So each H would have two couplings, each causing a triplet split. That would lead to a triplet of triplets.

So the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would have a triplet of triplets coupling pattern.

So looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets. So I would think the answer is B.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH produces a light yellow solid (product 1). The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction involves elimination of HBr, forming a carbonyl-containing compound. Based on the NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H), product 1 is likely a ketone or ester with a rigid adamantane framework.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of a double bond (product 2). Al isopropoxide can promote elimination reactions, converting the carbonyl group in product 1 into a double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis of product 2**:  
   Ozonolysis at -78°C followed by dimethyl sulfide cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. Therefore, product 3 contains carbonyl groups at the sites where the double bond was cleaved.

4. **NMR analysis of product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is on a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl. The CH₂ group is also adjacent to another CH₂ group, which introduces coupling. Each hydrogen on the CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern. Additionally, the same hydrogen may couple with another set of hydrogens, leading to a triplet of triplets coupling pattern.

5. **Coupling pattern**:
