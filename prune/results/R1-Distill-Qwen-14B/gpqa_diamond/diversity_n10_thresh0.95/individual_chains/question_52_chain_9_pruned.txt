Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that there's a star with certain characteristics: 1.5 solar radii, 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

So, the main thing happening here is that when spots cover part of the star's surface, the overall effective temperature decreases. Now, the part about the Ti atoms is interesting. When the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. Okay, so the ratio is N1/N2. Without spots, this ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So, the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So, (N1/N2)_no_spots is higher than (N1/N2)_with_spots. So the factor would be the ratio when there are no spots divided by the ratio when there are spots.

But how do we calculate this ratio? I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, wait, let me get that right. The ratio of the number of atoms in the upper level (N2) to the lower level (N1) is (g2/g1) multiplied by exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So, the ratio N2/N1 depends exponentially on temperature and the energy difference.

But wait, the question gives us the wavelength of the transition, which is 1448 Å. So, that's the wavelength emitted when an electron moves from level 2 to level 1. So, the energy difference can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

Alternatively, I can think of the energy as being quantized between the two levels. So, the energy difference ΔE is hc/λ. Let me compute that value.

Wait, but maybe I don't need the exact value. Let's think about how the ratio changes when the temperature changes. Because the star's temperature is lower when spots are present, the ratio N2/N1 would decrease, because the exponential term becomes smaller as T decreases.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio N1/N2. Oh, right. So, N1/N2 is the inverse of N2/N1. So, if N2/N1 decreases when T decreases, then N1/N2 increases. But wait, the question states that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. That's confusing.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me restate: When the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K) than when it doesn't (6000 K). Then, the observed ratio of N1/N2 (lower level to upper level) decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, that can't be right because if the temperature is lower, the Boltzmann factor would mean that the population in the higher energy level (level 2) would decrease more, so N2 would be lower. So, N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would increase. But the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That seems contradictory.

Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.

"The ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) ... decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, so without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1 when there are spots, which is lower than when there are no spots. So, the ratio N2/N1 goes down, and N1/N2 goes up.

Wait, but the question says that the ratio (N1/N2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases. Thus, N1/N2 increases. So the opposite of what's observed.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps the transition corresponds to a different selection. Or maybe I'm getting the levels confused.

Wait, perhaps the transition from level 2 to level 1 emits a photon of wavelength 1448 Å. So, when an electron moves from level 2 to level 1, it emits this photon. So, the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So, the energy of level 2 is higher than level 1. So, level 2 is the upper level, level 1 is the lower level.

So, the Boltzmann factor is about the probability of being in level 2 vs level 1.

The ratio N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

So, as T decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio N2/N1 decreases. Therefore, N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) increases.

But according to the problem, when T is lower (with spots), the ratio N1/N2 is observed to decrease. That's conflicting.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm misapplying the equation. Perhaps the ratio is N1/(N2), and the factor is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). No, wait, no. The Boltzmann distribution is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, if the temperature decreases, the exponential term (exp(-ΔE/(k T))) becomes smaller because the denominator is smaller. So N2/N1 decreases, so N1/N2 increases.

But the problem says when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 decreases. That's contradictory. So perhaps I've got the ratio the wrong way.

Wait, maybe the problem defines the ratio as N2/N1. Because if the ratio N2/N1 decreases, then when spots are present, the ratio is lower, and the factor would be (N2/N1)_no_spots divided by (N2/N1)_with_spots. So that would be a higher factor. But the question says the ratio (of N1/N2) decreases. So maybe the problem is using the inverse of what I'm thinking.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's compute the ratio for both cases.

Let me denote:

R = N1 / N2

We have to find R_no_spots / R_with_spots.

Because it's stated that R decreases when spots are present, so R_no_spots is larger than R_with_spots.

So, R_no_spots = (N1_1)/(N2_1)

R_with_spots = (N1_2)/(N2_2)

We can write R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, because N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) )

So, R is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, for each case, at T1 = 6000 K and T2 = 5500 K.

E2 - E1 = hc / λ

Compute E2 - E1:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So, E = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) )

Compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divided by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

But that's in Joules. To get it in terms of eV (electron volts), since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. Wait, 1448 Å is in the near UV or visible? Hmm, 1448 Å is about 144 nm, which is in the UV range. So a transition of about 8.56 eV. That's a big jump. Wait, but typically, for Ti I (neutral Titanium) lines, I think the energy differences are smaller, but perhaps for this problem, that's the given value.

But perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute again.

Wait, h*c = 12400 eV·Å. So, E in eV is 12400 / λ (Å).

So, λ = 1448 Å.

E = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.56 eV. Yeah, that's correct. That's a high energy transition, but okay.

So, E = 8.56 eV.

Now, the ratio R is proportional to exp( E/(k T) ), since R = (g1/g2) * exp( E/(k T) )

Wait, no. Because E is E2 - E1, which is positive. So, R = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But wait, wait, the Boltzmann distribution is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, R = (g1/g2) * exp( E/(k T) ), where E is E2-E1.

Assuming that g1 and g2 are known or perhaps considered constant, but the problem doesn't give them. So, perhaps the statistical weights cancel out when taking the ratio of R_no_spots to R_with_spots.

So, R_no_spots / R_with_spots = [ exp( E/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( E/(k T_with_spots) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( E/(k) [ 1/(T_no_spots) - 1/(T_with_spots) ] )

So, the factor is exp( E/(k) ( 1/T1 - 1/T2 ) )

Wait, because R is proportional to exp(E/(k T)), so when T decreases, R increases.

Wait, no, when T increases, E/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is smaller. So R is proportional to exp( E/(k T) ), which would be larger when T is lower.

Because when T is lower, E/(k T) is larger. So, exponent is larger, R is larger. So, R_no_spots is at T1=6000 K, R_with_spots at T2=5500 K.

So, the factor R_no_spots/R_with_spots = exp( E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Compute this.

E = 8.56 eV.

But k is in J/(K), so I need to convert E into J.

E = 8.56 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.371e-18 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, E/(k) = 1.371e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 9.93e4 K.

So, E/(k) ≈ 99,300 K.

Now, 1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4 K^-1.

So, (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4) = (-0.1515e-4) K^-1.

Wait, that's a negative number. So, E/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = 99300 * (-0.1515e-4) 

Compute that:

Multiply 99300 by 0.1515e-4.

99300 * 0.1515e-4 = 99300 * 1.515e-5 = ?

Let me compute 99300 * 1.515e-5:

99300 = 9.93e4.

1.515e-5 is 0.00001515.

Multiply 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.93 * 1.515 * 1e-1.

Compute 9.93 * 1.515 ≈ 15.06.

So, 15.06 * 0.1 = 1.506.

But since it's multiplied by a negative, it's -1.506.

So, the exponent is approx -1.506.

So, the factor is exp(-1.506) ≈ ?

Compute exp(-1.506): exp(1.506) is about 4.51, so exp(-1.506) is 1/4.51 ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but the factor is R_no_spots / R_with_spots = exp( E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = exp( -1.506 ) ≈ 0.221.

So, the ratio R_no_spots is 0.221 times R_with_spots. Wait, but that can't be right because when T decreases, R (N1/N2) increases, so R_no_spots (at higher T) should be lower than R_with_spots (lower T).

Wait, wait. I think I messed up the exponent. Let me re-express the factor:

Factor = exp( [E/(k)] * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Given that 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative (since T2 > T1), the exponent is negative, so the factor is less than 1.

Which would mean R_no_spots = factor * R_with_spots.

But, given that when T decreases (T2 < T1), R increases, so R_with_spots is higher than R_no_spots. So, R_no_spots / R_with_spots would be less than 1, which matches what we calculated: approximately 0.221.

Wait, but the question states that when the star has spots (at T2=5500 K), the ratio R (N1/N2) decreases. But our calculation shows that R increases when T decreases, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Let me re-examine the setup.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is E1 - E2, not E2 - E1. Let's think about this again.

If the transition corresponds to a photon emitted when moving from level 2 to level 1, then E2 > E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. So the equation is correct.

Wait, but if the ratio R is N1/N2, and when T decreases, R increases. So when the star has spots (lower T), R is larger, which is the opposite of what the problem says.

The problem says when spots are present, the ratio R (N1/N2) decreases. So, this would mean that R_with_spots < R_no_spots, which would only happen if the factor is greater than 1, which isn't what our calculation shows.

Hmm. Maybe I'm miscalculating the energy.

Wait, let's compute E = hc/λ again. Wait, earlier I computed it using 12400 eV·Å/λ(Å) to get E in eV. Let me make sure that is correct.

Yes, because hc = 12400 eV·Å. So E in eV is 12400 / λ (in Å). For λ = 1448 Å, E = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.56 eV. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should check the calculation of (1/T1 - 1/T2).

T1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

So, 1/6000 - 1/5500 = 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151.

So, (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative, so the entire exponent is negative.

Thus, exp( negative ) is a small number, less than 1. So, the factor R_no_spots/R_with_spots is 0.221.

But according to the problem, R decreases when the star has spots, meaning R_with_spots < R_no_spots. So 0.221 = R_no_spots / R_with_spots.

So, R_with_spots = R_no_spots * (1/0.221) ≈ 4.527 R_no_spots.

But that's the opposite of what the problem states. Hmm, that's a problem because in the problem, when the star has spots, R (N1/N2) decreases. So, R_with_spots < R_no_spots, which would require R_no_spots/R_with_spots > 1.

Wait, but according to our calculation, the ratio is 0.221, which is less than 1, implying R_no_spots < R_with_spots, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, the ratio R is N1/N2. The Boltzmann equation says that N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when T increases, the exponent (E/(k T)) decreases, so R decreases.

So, higher T leads to lower R (N1/N2), and lower T leads to higher R.

So, when the star has spots, T is lower, so R is higher (N1/N2 increases).

But the problem says that when the star has spots, R decreases. That's conflicting.

So, perhaps the problem is actually referring to the ratio N2/N1. Let me assume that the ratio given is N2/N1, which would be the opposite.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So, if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases, which aligns with the Boltzmann equation.

Because, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k T) )

So, lower T makes the exponential term smaller, so N2/N1 decreases. So the ratio (N2/N1)_with_spots < (N2/N1)_no_spots.

If that's the case, then the factor would be (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_with_spots = exp( E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed things up. Let me recompute.

If the ratio being considered is N2/N1, then:

R = N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k T) )

So, when T decreases, R decreases.

So, in our case, when the star has spots, T is 5500 K, so R_with_spots = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k * 5500) )

And when no spots, T is 6000 K, R_no_spots = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k * 6000) )

So, the factor is:

Factor = R_no_spots / R_with_spots = [ exp( -E/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( -E/(k *5500) ) ]

Which is exp( E/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000 ) )

Compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000 )= 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 1/(66,000) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So, E/(k) is about 99,300 K.

So, E/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000 ) = 99,300 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.506.

So, the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ 4.51.

So, the factor is approximately 4.5, which would be option C.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio (I think it's N1/N2) decreases when spots are present.

But according to this calculation, if the ratio is N2/N1, the factor is 4.5, which is option C.

But the problem states that the ratio (N1/N2) decreases when spots are present. So, perhaps the problem is using N1/N2, which would be the inverse of what I just calculated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is about N1/N2. Let me see.

If the ratio is N1/N2, then R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( E/(k T) )

So, R_no_spots = (g1/g2) exp( E/(k *6000) )

R_with_spots = (g1/g2) exp( E/(k *5500) )

So, the factor is R_no_spots / R_with_spots = exp( E/(k) ( 1/6000 - 1/5500 ) )

Which is exp( E/(k) * ( -1.515e-5 ) )

Which is exp( -1.506 ) ≈ 0.221.

So, the factor is 0.221, implying that R_no_spots is about 0.221 times R_with_spots, meaning R_no_spots < R_with_spots. But the problem says that when spots are present, R (N1/N2) is lower. So, this would mean R_with_spots < R_no_spots, which contradicts because 0.221 < 1, so R_no_spots = 0.221 * R_with_spots. So, R_with_spots = R_no_spots / 0.221 ≈ 4.52 R_no_spots.

But that's the opposite of what the problem states. So, this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference was calculated incorrectly. Let me check that again.

E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Wait, hc in eV·Å is 12400, so E = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Yes. So, that's correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's luminosity and how spots affect the observed spectrum.

Wait, when spots are present, the overall effective temperature is lower, so the star emits less flux. But how does that affect the line ratios?

Alternatively, maybe the equivalent width or the strength of the spectral lines would change, but the problem is specifically about the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels.

Wait, another thought: the star's surface isn't isothermal. When spots are present, parts of the surface are cooler, perhaps leading to a different excitation temperature in those regions.

But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE. So, each region is in local thermodynamic equilibrium, but with varying temperatures.

But the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, but the effective temperature is an average, but the actual surface has regions at 6000 K (unspotted) and cooler regions (spots) at a lower temperature.

But the problem says to treat the photosphere as being in LTE. So, perhaps the effective temperature isn't the same as the local temperature.

Wait, no, the effective temperature is the overall, but the local temperature varies. But when calculating the line ratios, it's based on the local temperature in each region.

But the problem is asking about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels. If parts of the photosphere are cooler (spots), then in those regions, the Boltzmann factor would be different, leading to a different ratio in those regions.

But the question says that when the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. But for the purpose of the ratio, are we considering the average over all regions, or the ratio in each region?

Wait, the problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So, perhaps the average ratio across the entire surface has decreased.

But how does that average work? Because some parts are cooler (spots) and others are hotter (unspotted regions).

Wait, but the problem states that when the surface is covered by spots (40% coverage), the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So, perhaps the entire star is now at 5500 K, which would be a bit odd, but maybe it's a simplified model.

No, that doesn't make sense because spots are cooler regions. So, the star's overall luminosity would be lower, but the effective temperature is given as 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the average temperature of the photosphere as 5500 K when 40% of the surface is spotted. That would imply that the star's overall effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, but the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature.

But that complicates the calculation because the ratio would then be a weighted average of the ratios from the different regions.

But the problem says to assume LTE in the photosphere. So perhaps each region (spot and unspot) is in LTE, and their contributions to the observed ratio are combined.

But the problem is phrased as the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels, which would be an average over the entire photosphere.

Hmm, maybe the approach is to consider the average.

Wait, when the entire photosphere has an effective temperature of 6000 K, the ratio R is R1.

When 40% of the surface is cooler (spots) at T_spot, and 60% is at 6000 K, what is the overall R?

But the problem states that when 40% is covered, the overall effective T is 5500 K. So, perhaps the effective temperature is given by:

L = 4π R^2 σ Teff^4

But the star's luminosity would be the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions.

Let me compute the effective temperature when 40% of the surface is at T_spot, and 60% at 6000 K.

But wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But perhaps this isn't necessary for the ratio calculation, as the problem gives us the effective temperatures for both cases.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying the situation by saying that the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise. So, we can treat the entire photosphere as being at T_eff without spots and T_eff with spots.

But that would be a simplification because the spots are cooler regions, but perhaps it's how the problem is structured.

In that case, the ratio R (N1/N2) is determined by the effective temperature of the entire photosphere.

So, for R_no_spots: T1 = 6000 K.

R_with_spots: T2 = 5500 K.

So, R = (g1/g2) exp(E/(k T)).

The factor is R_no_spots / R_with_spots = exp( E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is exp( (8.56 eV) / (k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, but as earlier, that would give a factor of exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.221, which is less than 1, meaning R_no_spots is smaller than R_with_spots. Which contradicts the problem statement that R decreases when spots are present.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if the ratio is N2/N1, then the factor would be exp(1.506) ≈4.5, which is option C.

But the problem states that the ratio (N1/N2) decreases when spots are present, meaning R_with_spots < R_no_spots. Which would require that R_no_spots = factor * R_with_spots, where factor >1.

But according to the calculation, when the ratio is N1/N2, the factor is 0.221, which is less than 1. So, if the ratio is N2/N1, then the factor is 4.5, which is option C.

But the problem says that the ratio (N1/N2) decreases when spots are present. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the factor as N2/N1.

So, let's proceed with that.

So, R = N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k T) )

So, factor = R_no_spots / R_with_spots = exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because:

R_no_spots = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k T1) )

R_with_spots = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k T2) )

So, factor = exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) 

Which is exp( (E/(k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/ (5500*6000 )= 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 /66,000 ≈ 1.515e-5.

E/(k) is 99300 K.

So, 99300 * 1.515e-5 = approximately 1.506.

So, exp(1.506) ≈4.506.

So, the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

So, the ratio N2/N1 increases by a factor of 4.5 when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. But the problem states that the ratio N1/N2 decreases, which would imply that N2/N1 increases, which aligns with this.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the ratio N1/N2. So, if N2/N1 increases by a factor of 4.5, then N1/N2 decreases by a factor of 4.5.

Ah, wait, because N1/N2 is the inverse of N2/N1. So, if N2/N1 increases by 4.5, then N1/N2 decreases by 1/4.5 ≈0.222. But the problem says the ratio N1/N2 decreases when spots are present, which would imply that the factor is (N1/N2 without spots) / (N1/N2 with spots) = 4.5. Because when you have spots, the ratio is lower, so without spots, it's higher.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Let R_no = N1/N2 without spots.

R_sp = N1/N2 with spots.

The problem says R_sp < R_no.

So, factor = R_no / R_sp.

Earlier, we found that when considering N2/N1, the factor is 4.5. Because N2/N1_no / N2/N1_sp =4.5.

Thus, N2/N1_no =4.5 * N2/N1_sp.

But R_no = N1/N2_no = 1/(N2/N1_no) = 1/(4.5 * (N2/N1_sp) ) = (1/4.5) (N1/N2_sp ) = (1/4.5) R_sp.

So, R_no = R_sp /4.5.

Which means R_no / R_sp = 1/4.5 ≈ 0.222.

But the problem states that R decreases when spots are present, meaning R_sp < R_no, so R_no/R_sp >1, but according to this, it's 0.222, which is less than 1. So, that's a contradiction.

Hmm. I think I'm getting myself confused here. Let me think differently.

Perhaps the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So, if the ratio is lower when spots are present, the factor is (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots), which would be greater than 1.

In that case, the factor is 4.5. Because when the star has spots, the ratio N2/N1 is lower, but the factor we computed is 4.5.

Wait, perhaps I should avoid getting stuck and look for the answer based on the calculation.

We computed that the factor (R_no_spots / R_with_spots) is 4.5 if the ratio being considered is N2/N1. But the problem is about N1/N2, which would invert this, giving a factor of 1/4.5≈0.222.

But the problem says that the ratio (N1/N2) decreases when spots are present, implying that R_no > R_sp, so the factor would be R_no/R_sp >1. But our calculation gives 0.222, which is less than 1.

This suggests that perhaps the ratio is N2/N1, and the factor is 4.5. So, the ratio increases by a factor of 4.5 when the star doesn't have spots.

In that case, the factor would be 4.5, which is option C.

But the problem states that the ratio (N1/N2) decreases when spots are present. So, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the way the factor is presented is the reciprocal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio as N2/N1, and the factor is 4.5, which would align with the problem statement.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio (N1/N2) decreases, so if the ratio is N1/N2, the factor is less than 1. But the options don't have 0.22, only option A is ~1.1, which is close to 1.

Wait, but I'm getting a factor of 4.5 for N2/N1. But the problem is about N1/N2, so perhaps the factor is 1/4.5, which is about 0.222. But that's not among the options.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement.

"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) ... decreases when the star has spots."

So, the ratio is N1/N2. Without spots, ratio is higher; with spots, ratio is lower.

So, the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots = ?

Which, based on our calculation, R_no/R_sp = exp( E/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) = exp( -1.506 ) ≈0.221.

But that would mean the factor is about 0.22, which isn't an option. The options are A: ~1.1, B: ~7.8, C: ~4.5, D: ~2.9.

Wait, but the option C is 4.5, which is the factor we calculated for N2/N1. So perhaps the problem is considering the ratio N2/N1, and the factor is 4.5.

But the problem states that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when spots are present. So, perhaps the answer is 4.5, but I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the ratio is N2/N1, which increases when Teff decreases, and the factor would be 4.5.

But the problem says the ratio N1/N2 decreases, which is the inverse.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of N1/N2, and the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots = exp( E/(k) (1/6000 -1/5500) ) = exp( -1.506 ) ≈0.221. But none
