Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions and NMR coupling patterns.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's pretty rigid. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C—I think that's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, an E2 elimination. Since there are two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3, when KOH is used in excess, it should abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe dehydrobrominated. Wait, no, when you eliminate two equivalents of HBr, you form a double bond. So from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, eliminating two HBr molecules would form a diene, but wait, the structure of adamantane has four equivalent positions. Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound with a double bond.

The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a high chemical shift, maybe an epoxide or an ether. Oh wait, but the IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Hmm, but the initial reaction is elimination, which forms a double bond. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, KOH is a strong base, but heating with excess KOH could lead to elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, no, substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is. But with KOH, elimination is more likely, especially if heated. So product 1 is likely an alkene.

Wait, but if the product's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, that's maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Or perhaps an epoxide. Wait, the IR at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's a ketone. If the elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion, perhaps forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but oxidation? No, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario? Or perhaps more likely, it's an elimination forming a double bond. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Maybe the product isn't just a diene. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, causing an elimination to form a ketone. How? Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Oh, right! Because when a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent X groups) is treated with a strong base, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a ketone. So, two HBr eliminations would lead to a carbonyl.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two molecules of HBr, forming a ketone. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone or something similar. But let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so making a ketone would put a carbonyl in a specific position. Then, the NMR would show a carbonyl peak (but the given IR is 1720, which fits a ketone). The 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That might be a methylene group next to the carbonyl, perhaps. Or maybe it's an epoxide, but the IR doesn't fit that.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is the formation of an epoxide. Wait, but if that were the case, the IR would show an epoxide peak around 1250-1050 cm^-1. The given IR is at 1720, which is more like a ketone. So probably, product 1 is a ketone.

So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanone. Then, what about the NMR? The 4.79 ppm is a singlet integrating for 2H. Hmm, but a ketone adjacent group would typically be a CH2 group. Wait, no—if the carbonyl is in a bridge position, maybe the adjacent carbons have CH2 groups that are deshielded.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, if KOH is in excess, maybe it's a double substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would require two substitutions to form a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a double elimination forming a conjugated diene, and the IR's 1720 cm^-1 is due to another functional group introduced during the reaction. No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, creating a ring contraction. So, the dihalide becomes a ketone. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-adamantanone. Then, moving to the next step.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Hmm. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone (like 1,3-adamantanone), heating with Al isopropoxide might be a Friedel-Crafts catalyst. But 1,3-adamantanone is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of enol ether formation or something else.

Wait, wait. Another thought: perhaps product 1 is a diene. Oh, because the initial reaction is elimination of two HBr's, creating a conjugated diene. Then, when product 1 (diene) is heated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction. But without a dienophile, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene that undergoes some cycloaddition or ring formation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form an epoxide? No, that usually requires peracids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide undergoes some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. But product 1's NMR doesn't suggest an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is a diol from a substitution. But earlier I thought that would not explain the IR. Let me reevaluate that. If product 1 is a diol, then the IR wouldn't show 1720 cm-1. So probably not.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-adamantanone via double elimination. Then, product 1 has a ketone group. Then, when heated with excess Al isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3), perhaps it undergoes some enol formation or another reaction.

Wait, another thought: Friedel-Crafts acylation uses a ketone as the acylating agent. But for Friedel-Crafts, the substrate needs to be an aromatic ring. But adamantane is a diamondoid, not aromatic. So maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is used to induce some kind of carbonyl addition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a dienol. No, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a Claisen rearrangement. The Claisen rearrangement involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But for that, you need an allyl vinyl ether, which I don't think is the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene which, when treated with Al isopropoxide, undergoes some kind of Diels-Alder reaction. But again, without a dienophile, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should think about product 2. Then, product 2 is ozonolyzed. So, let's think about that. Ozonolysis of a diene would break the double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has conjugated double bonds, ozonolysis would cleave them. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Let me try to structure this:

1. Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH → elimination forms a carbonyl group, so product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone.

2. Product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide → perhaps some kind of enol formation or cyclization.

Wait, but Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, and when heated, it can cause certain reactions. Maybe it's used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes, but product 1 is a ketone, not an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and in the second step, it's epoxidized. But then, why would Al isopropoxide be used for that? Typically, epoxidation uses peracids.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the first step wrong. Let's go back.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → ?

Alternative possibility: It's a double elimination, forming an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-adamantadiene. The NMR then would have peaks corresponding to the alkene protons.

But product 1's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Alkene protons usually appear between 4.5-6.5 ppm. So, maybe those are the alkene protons. But then, why the IR at 1720 cm^-1? That's a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is the formation of a cyclopropane via a Simmons-Smith reaction, but that uses a different catalyst (like Zn(Cu)) and isn't with KOH.

Wait, another approach: The IR of product 1 shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So, product 1 must have a carbonyl group.

So the first reaction must produce a ketone or an ester. But starting from a dihalide, the most likely is a ketone via double elimination (two dehydrohalogenations). So, product 1 is a ketone.

Now, the NMR: 4.79 (2H, singlet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, multiplet), 1.94 (2H, triplet or something). So, the 4.79 peak is likely a CH2 group next to an electronegative group. Since it's a singlet, perhaps it's adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, in a ketone, the alpha protons (next to carbonyl) are usually split. For example, in acetone, the CH3 is a singlet. But if it's a CH2 next to the ketone, perhaps it's a singlet if there's symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, the 4.79 is 2H. Let's say that's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, perhaps the structure is something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(...)

But the integration is 2H, so maybe it's a geminal di-substitution? Or perhaps it's a bridgehead structure.

Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be an oxygen-bearing CH2, like in an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone? No, probably not. Or maybe a cyclic ketone.

Wait, if product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, the structure would have a bridge. The NMR's 4.79 ppm could be a bridgehead CH2 group.

Wait, in adamantane derivatives, bridgehead protons are often downfield. But 4.79 is a bit high; maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 is a methylene group in a ring structure, perhaps in a bridge.

Let's move on for a moment. So product 1 is a ketone. Next, it's heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. What does that do?

Wait, I'm thinking that perhaps product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form a hemiacetal or acetal, but that's for carbonyl protection. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but adamantane isn't aromatic.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diene, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a Diels-Alder-type reaction with the Lewis acid as a catalyst. But without a dienophile, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and the Al isopropoxide induces some kind of cyclization. But I'm not fully getting this step.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when heated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement typically involves a 1,2-diol losing water to form a carbonyl group. But product 1 is a ketone, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol and then undergoes some elimination, but earlier I thought the IR would show a different peak.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is an epoxide formed via some reaction catalyzed by Al isopropoxide. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a dienol ether. If product 1 is a diene, then Al isopropoxide could help generate an enol ether. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a tricyclic compound, such as adamantane with an additional ring formed via some cycloaddition.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed, then worked up with dimethyl sulfide to form product 3. Ozonolysis of a diene typically cleaves it into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But wait, product 3's NMR is the focus. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding exchangeable ones.

So, let's try to imagine the structure. Product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would break the double bonds into carbonyls. So the resulting product would have carbonyl groups. The NMR would then show any remaining hydrogens, especially those near the carbonyls.

But product 3 is the ozonolysis product. So, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated diene, which upon ozonolysis becomes two carbonyl groups. Then, the product 3 would have carbonyl groups and perhaps some CH2 groups next to them.

Wait, but the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. Deshielded hydrogens are typically those in electronegative environments, like near oxygen or carbonyl groups. So, perhaps these are the protons adjacent to the carbonyl.

In the ozonolysis product, if the original diene was symmetric, then the carbonyl groups would be in symmetric positions, and the adjacent protons would be equivalent. But if the diene was part of a ring, perhaps the resulting structure has different environments.

Wait, let's think about the initial structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines in specific positions. Upon elimination, the product is a diene (product 1), which is then treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 is ozonolyzed.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a dienol ether or another diene derivative.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction. But without a dienophile, maybe it undergoes a thermal electrocyclic ring closure, forming a cyclopropane or another ring.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic diene, which upon ozonolysis forms a diketone or similar.

But let's get back. Let's imagine product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would yield a single molecule with two carbonyls.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a conjugated diene (like 1,3-butadiene) would produce two carbonyls. For example, 1,3-butadiene would give two formaldehyde molecules. But in a cyclic diene, the ozonolysis would break the ring and form a dicarbonyl compound.

Alternatively, if the diene is part of a bridge structure, the ozonolysis might lead to a more complex structure, perhaps with multiple rings.

Wait, but perhaps product 2 is a substituted cyclohexene or something similar. Ozonolysis would then form a diketone or dialdehyde.

But the product 3's NMR is what's in question. If product 3 is a diketone, then the protons near the carbonyl groups would be deshielded.

So, what's the coupling pattern for such protons? Let's think about the structure. If the carbonyl is next to a CH2 group, then each proton on CH2 would be split by neighboring protons.

Assuming the structure is something like CH2-CO, the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl. The protons on the CH2 would be a triplet if each is split by two neighboring CH2 groups. Wait, no. Each proton on the CH2 would be adjacent to two others on the same group, but in reality, the splitting comes from neighboring groups.

Wait, let's model it. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. So each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. The central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups on either side. Wait, no, if it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 is attached to a carbonyl on one end and another CH2 on the other.

Wait, but in this scenario, each CH2 group would be next to another CH2 group. So the protons on the middle CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups. So for each CH2, the protons would be coupled to the adjacent CH2.

In such a situation, each proton on the CH2 would be a quartet (n+1, where n=3, because each proton is split by three neighboring protons? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Each CH2 has two neighboring protons on the same carbon and two on the adjacent. Wait, no. Let me think about a simple ethylene glycol type structure. If you have O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, each CH2 is connected to another CH2. Each proton on the CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each CH2 group would be a triplet.

Wait, no. Each CH2 group has two neighboring CH2 groups. For example, consider a structure like A-CH2-CH2-B, where A and B are carbonyl groups. Each CH2 is between the two carbonyls. The central CH2 (if any) would have adjacent CH2 groups on both sides. But in this structure, it's a four-carbon chain: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, no, that's a three-carbon chain. O=C-CH2-CH2-CO would be four carbons, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, but that's a four-carbon chain. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group next to each carbonyl. So, the structure could be something like (CH2)2(CO)2. But in that case, each CH2 would be between two CO groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane ring with ketone groups. No, ozonolysis doesn't form cyclopropane.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks a six-membered ring into a four-membered diketone. For example, if product 2 is a bicyclic diene, ozonolysis might break it into a smaller ring with ketone groups.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's think differently. Let's think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which is likely near a carbonyl.

In the ozonolysis product, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. So, these are likely to be CH2 groups next to ketones.

Each of these protons would couple with neighboring protons. So, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the middle CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Each proton on the middle CH2 would couple with two protons on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, but the central CH2 would have two neighboring groups: the CH2 on the left and the CH2 on the right. Each of the four protons (two on each side) would couple with each other. But in reality, the coupling would be between the two CH2 groups. So, each CH2 would be split into a triplet.

Wait, here's an example. Suppose you have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. The central CH2 (if any) would have two adjacent groups. But in this case, it's a four-carbon chain. So, each CH2 next to a carbonyl (O=C-CH2- and -CH2-CO) would have their protons coupled with the adjacent CH2 groups.

Each CH2 would be a triplet because each has two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2. For example, the CH2 next to O=C would have two protons on the adjacent CH2. Each proton in this CH2 would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. Similarly, the CH2 next to CO would also be a triplet.

But wait, in a four-carbon chain, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, there are two CH2 groups. The first CH2 (attached to CO) would be split by the adjacent CH2's two protons, so each of its protons would be a triplet. The same for the second CH2.

But if the two CH2 groups are equivalent (due to symmetry), then their NMR signals would overlap. So, in the NMR, the triplet would appear as a triplet integrating for four protons (two CH2 groups × two protons each).

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So, each of these CH2 protons would be a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex. Suppose the ozonolysis creates a diketone with each ketone adjacent to a CH2 group that is next to another CH2. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Now, each CH2 has two neighboring CH2 groups (the other CH2 on each side). No, in this case, each CH2 has only one neighboring CH2 group (the next one in the chain).

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, a five-carbon chain. Each internal CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups. So, the middle CH2 groups would have four neighboring protons (two on each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet (n=4, so n+1=5 → pentet). But the question is about the most deshielded, which would be the end CH2 groups, each attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, no, the end CH2 groups would be attached to the carbonyl, so their chemical shift would be more downfield. Each end CH2 would have only one neighboring CH2 group (the middle one). So, each end CH2's protons would be split by two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, let's model this. Structure: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. Each end CH2 (O=C-CH2- and -CH2-CO) has one neighboring CH2. Each of their protons would see two protons on the adjacent CH2, so each would be a triplet.

But wait, the structure might not be a straight chain. It could be a ring. If product 2 is a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would break the ring and form a diketone. For example, a cyclohexene derivative would become a diketone upon ozonolysis.

Suppose product 2 is cyclohexene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, but in a ring, that would form a diketone. Wait, no. Ozonolysis of cyclohexene would actually give a diketone if the diene is conjugated and in a ring. Wait, cyclohexene isn't a diene, though. Suppose product 2 is 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Ozonolysis would break the ring and form a diketone, perhaps a four-carbon chain with two ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bridgehead diene, which upon ozonolysis would form a tricyclic compound with ketone groups.

But regardless of the exact structure, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be deshielded. These would be the most downfield protons in the NMR.

So, each of these protons would be adjacent to a carbonyl and perhaps have neighboring CH2 groups. The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring non-equivalent protons.

If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, each CH2 would have two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2. So each CH2 proton would be a triplet.

Wait, but in a four-carbon chain, the end CH2 groups would have only one neighboring CH2. So each end CH2 would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CO, then each CH2 has no neighboring CH2 groups beyond the carbonyl. But that would leave only one CH2 group, which would be a singlet, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the structure is a diketone with two adjacent CH2 groups. So, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Each CH2 is between the two carbonyls. So, each CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups (the other CH2 on each side). No, each CH2 has only one neighboring CH2 group (the adjacent one), so each would be split into a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is next to another CH2 group, leading to more complex splitting. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. The middle CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two protons. So, the middle CH2's protons would be split into a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks). But the end CH2 groups would each have one neighboring CH2, leading to triplet.

But the question is about the most deshielded, which are the end CH2 groups (adjacent to carbonyl). So their protons would be triplets.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet. Option D is pentet.

Wait, but what if the structure is a bridge, leading to each CH2 being adjacent to two different sets of protons?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic compound where each CH2 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to more splitting.

Wait, another possibility: if the CH2 groups are in a chain where each is adjacent to two others, perhaps each CH2 is between two other CH2 groups. For example, in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, each internal CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to a quintet. But the end CH2 would have only one neighboring group, leading to a triplet.

But in this case, the end CH2 (most deshielded) would have a triplet coupling pattern.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 has one neighboring group. So each CH2 would be a triplet.

Wait, but what about the possibility of coupling with more than two protons? For example, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which has two protons, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group which itself is adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two protons. That would lead to a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, let's think. If a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different coupling constant, the splitting would be more complex. For example, if a CH2 proton is next to two different CH2 groups (each with two protons), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, leading to 3×3=9 peaks, but that's a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets if the couplings are different.

Wait, the splitting pattern depends on how many neighboring non-equivalent protons there are. If a hydrogen is adjacent to two different sets of two protons each, each with a different coupling constant, the splitting would be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the hydrogen is coupled to two equivalent sets, the splitting would be a triplet.

But in the case where a CH2 group is adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons, then each proton on the central CH2 would have coupling with four protons (two from each adjacent CH2). But because the two adjacent CH2 groups are equivalent, would this lead to a single quartet (n=3 → quartet) or a more complex pattern?

Wait, n in the n+1 rule is the number of neighboring equivalent protons. So, if a proton has two neighboring groups, each with two protons, but the two groups are equivalent, then n=4 (each group contributes two protons, but they're equivalent), leading to a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks). So, a pentet.

But wait, no. The n+1 rule applies when all the neighboring protons are equivalent. If the two adjacent CH2 groups are equivalent, then each CH2 has two protons. So, each proton on the central CH2 would be split by four equivalent protons, leading to a quintet.

But wait, the neighboring groups may not be equivalent. Suppose the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Each CH2 has one adjacent CH2. So, each CH2 is a triplet.

Wait, but if the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two protons, then each proton is split by two groups of two, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think of a specific example.

Imagine a structure where each CH2 is connected to two other CH2 groups. For example, a structure like CH2-CH2-CH2, but with each CH2 connected to two others. Wait, that's not possible for a straight chain, but perhaps in a ring?

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is part of a bridge, leading to each having two adjacent CH2 groups. So, each CH2 would be a triplet of triplets because it's coupled with two separate groups of two protons each.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet of triplets, making option B the correct answer.

Wait, the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, if the most deshielded hydrogen (adjacent to carbonyl) is coupled to two different sets of two protons each, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets (each coupling splits into a triplet, so overall 3×3=9 peaks, but it's usually observed as a triplet of triplets).

Alternatively, if the coupling is with three equivalent protons, it would be a quartet.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the ozonolysis product. If product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Suppose product 2 is a 1,3-diene in a ring structure, which upon ozonolysis forms a diketone.

The resulting product 3 would have two ketone groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group. Each CH2 group would have two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to each CH2 proton being split by four protons (two on each adjacent CH2). But if the two adjacent CH2 groups are equivalent, then n=4 (as each has two equivalent protons), so the splitting would be a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks, a pentet).

So in that case, the coupling pattern would be a pentet, which is option D.

Alternatively, if the adjacent groups are not equivalent, the splitting would be more complex, perhaps a triplet of triplets.

But in the case of a symmetric molecule, the adjacent groups would be equivalent, leading to a quintet.

Wait, but the most deshielded hydrogen would be the one next to the carbonyl. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, each CH2 has one adjacent CH2 group. So each CH2's protons would be split into a triplet.

But wait, if the two CH2 groups are adjacent and each has two protons, then each CH2 would be a triplet. So the end CH2 groups would show a triplet in their NMR.

But then, the middle CH2 (if any) would be a quintet. But in the case of O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, there are no middle CH2 groups; it's a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, a five-carbon chain. Then, the middle CH2 would have two adjacent CH2 groups, each with two protons. So each of its protons would be a quintet. The end CH2 groups would each have one adjacent CH2, so their protons would be triplets.

But the question is about the most deshielded, which are the end CH2 groups. So their coupling would be triplet.

But earlier I thought the most deshielded would be the end CH2 groups. So their NMR would be triplet.

But the options include triplet as option A. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but what if the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to two other CH2 groups (like in a ring), leading to each CH2 being a quintet. But that's more likely if it's a bridge structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone with each ketone next to a CH2 group, which in turn is next to another CH2 group that's part of a bridge. So each CH2 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Given the options, I'm leaning towards the most deshielded hydrogen being a triplet. So the answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves analyzing a multi-step organic reaction sequence to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the final product (product 3). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C is a double dehydrohalogenation (elimination), forming a ketone. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl group. The product is likely **1,3-adamantanone**.  
   - The NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al isopropoxide**  
   Heating 1,3-adamantanone with aluminum isopropoxide likely induces a reaction, but the exact transformation is unclear. A plausible outcome is the formation of a diene (product 2), which sets up the molecule for ozonolysis in the next step.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. If product 2 is a diene, product 3 will contain carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogens in product 3 are adjacent to these carbonyls.

4. **Analysis of product 3's NMR**  
   The most deshielded hydrogens are likely CH₂ groups adjacent to carbonyl groups. These protons are split by neighboring protons.  
   - If each CH₂ is adjacent to one other CH₂ group, the splitting pattern is a **triplet** (n = 2, where n is the number of equivalent neighboring protons).  
   - If the CH₂ groups are adjacent to two different sets of protons, the splitting could be more complex, such as a triplet of triplets. However, the simplest and most likely scenario is that each CH₂ is adjacent to one CH₂ group, leading to a **triplet**.

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
