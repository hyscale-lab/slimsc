Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about starspots and how they can mimic the light curve of an exoplanet. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will come into and go out of view, causing brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transiting the star.

Wait, so the problem is asking, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness change (signal), what would be the planet's radius relative to the star. So the key is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the transit depth is the same as the spot-induced variation.

First, I remember that the transit method measures the drop in brightness when a planet passes in front of the star. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the areas of the planet and star. The formula is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area of a circle is πr², so the ratio squared.

But wait, in this case, the brightness variation isn't due to a planet blocking the light but due to cooler spots rotating into and out of view. So the star's brightness changes as the spotted area comes into view. Since spots are cooler, the star appears dimmer when spots are facing us and brighter when they're on the far side.

The star's brightness variation would then depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference. Oh right, the flux from a star is proportional to the area and the temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4). But when part of the star is cooler, the total flux drops.

So let's model this. The star's normal flux is F = σTeff^4. The spots have a temperature of Teff - 1000K, so T_spot = 5000K. The filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of the hemisphere is spots. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π R_star²) * 0.5, because it's a hemisphere. Or wait, no: the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the total surface area of the star. Because a hemisphere would be half the area, but the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Oh wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (4π Rstar² / 2) )? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4π Rstar². If one hemisphere (so 2π Rstar²) has spots covering 20% of that. So area of spots is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

So when the star rotates, the spotted area will come into view. The brightness variation will be the difference between when the spots are on the dayside (facing us) and when they aren't.

So the normal flux (without spots) is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π d²) ) → but maybe I don't need to get into the distance since we're looking for relative changes.

The flux when spots are facing us would be F_spots = F0 - (Flux from spots). The spots are cooler, so they contribute less. The spot's flux per unit area is σ T_spot^4. So the total flux from the spots when they're facing us is (area of spots) * σ T_spot^4.

But the rest of the star (non-spots) contributes σ Teff^4 * (Area without spots). Wait, the rest of the area is (2π R²) - (0.2 * 2π R²) ) = (0.8 * 2π R²) ) = 1.6 π R². So the flux when spots are visible is F = (1.6 π R² * σ Teff^4 ) + (0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4 ).

Wait, no, the area of the star is 4π R². When the spots are on the front hemisphere, the area not covered by spots is (2π R² - 0.2 * 2π R² ) = 1.6 π R².

So the flux when spots are visible is:

F_visible = [ (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 ] / (4π R²) )

Wait why? Because the star's total area is 4π R². When the spots are on the front, the front hemisphere (2π R²) has 0.4 π R² spots and 1.6 π R² non-spots. The back hemisphere (2π R²) is all non-spots. So the total flux is:

F_visible = [ (1.6 π R² (6000^4) + 2π R² (6000^4) ) ) + (0.4 π R² (5000^4) ) ] / (4π R² )

Wait, no, perhaps I should model the total flux as the sum of the flux from all parts of the star visible. So the front hemisphere has (0.8 * 2π R²) normal area (since 20% is spots) and the back hemisphere is all normal (2π R²).

Wait, the star's total surface is 4π R², so the front hemisphere is 2π R², and the back is 2π. The front has 20% spots: area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the front's non-spot area is 2π R² - 0.4π R² = 1.6 π R².

So F_visible = [ (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 ) ] / (4π R²) )

Wait no, that can't be right. Because when the star rotates, the spots on the front face contribute less flux. The back face is not visible, so it's the front face's flux that varies.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the average flux when the spots are visible and when they are not.

The star's total flux is the sum of the flux from the front and the back, but when the spots are on the front, the front's flux is from spots and non-spots. Wait, maybe I should think about this differently.

Alternatively, the maximum flux is when the entire unspotted surface is visible. The minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. So the difference between max and min flux is the amplitude of the variation.

No, wait. When the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower because some of the area is cooler. So the flux when the spots are visible is F_min = F0 * ( ( (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio of flux when spots are visible to when they're not.

The total flux when the star is unspotted on the face is F_normal = 4π R² * σ * Teff^4 / (4π d²) ) → simplifies to R² σ Teff^4 / d².

Wait, no, perhaps considering the star's total luminosity is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. So when the spots are on the front, the flux we receive is L * ( (Area_unspotted_front + Area_back) / (4π R²) ) * σ T^4 ?

Wait, maybe I should think of the fraction of the star's surface that's emitting at each temperature.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F = [ (1-fraction_spots) * Teff^4 + (fraction_spots) * T_spot^4 ] * (Area of front hemisphere) / (4π R²) ) * σ.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The total flux when the spots are in front is:

F = [ (1 - f) * (front hemisphere area) * Teff^4 + f * (front hemisphere area) * T_spot^4 ] / (4π R²).

Because the front hemisphere is (2π R²) area. So,

F = [ (1 - f) * 2π R² * Teff^4 + f * 2π R² * T_spot^4 ] / (4π R²) )

Simplify:

F = [ 2π R² ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ] / (4π R² )

The R² and π cancel out.

F = [ ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) * 2 ] / 4

Which simplifies to:

F = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ] * (1/2 )

So F = ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) / 2.

The normal flux (without spots) would be when the spots are on the back, so F0 = Teff^4 / 4 * 4π R² → wait, no. Wait, without any spots, F0 is Teff^4 because the entire star is at Teff. Alternatively, F0 is (4π R² σ Teff^4) / (4π d²) ) → which simplifies to (R² σ Teff^4)/d². But in terms of the flux when the spots are on the front, F is:

F = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (T_spot)^4 ] / 2 * (4π R² σ) / (4π d²) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it too much. Let's think in terms of the fractional change in flux.

The fractional change (ΔF/F0) is the difference between F when the spots are visible and when they're not. Wait no, when the spots are on the front, F is lower than when they're on the back. So the variation in brightness is F_max - F_min, where F_max is when the unspotted area is visible (when the spots are on the back) and F_min is when spots are on the front.

Wait, when the spots are on the back, the front is all unspotted. So in that case, the flux is F0 = (Teff^4), because the entire front (2π R²) is at Teff, and the back (2π R²) is also at Teff, but we can't see the back. Wait, no. Because the star's total flux is the sum of all its surface. So when the spots are on the back, the front is unspotted, so the flux is the same as the star without any spots. Oh wait, no. Because the star is emitting equally from all parts, but when the spots are on the back, they're not blocking our view. So the total flux when the spots are on the back is the same as when they're on the front? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's model the star as a sphere with two regions: the front and the back. When the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots (cooler) and the rest of the front. When it's the other side, the spots are on the back, and we see the entire front as unspotted.

No, wait, one hemisphere (say, the front) is covered with spots. So when the star is at a certain rotation angle, the front is spotted, and the back is unspotted. When it rotates 180 degrees, the back becomes the front, which is unspotted. So the maximum flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing.

So F_max is when front is all unspotted: so front (2π R²) is Teff^4, back is 2π R² also Teff^4. So the total flux is (4π R² σ Teff^4 )/(4π d²) ) → but more correctly, the flux when the entire star is at Teff is F0 = σ Teff^4. But when part is cooler, the flux is lower.

Wait, maybe I should model the situation as when the star is in the state where the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_min, and when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, it's F_max.

Wait, no. The star's total flux is the sum of all the surface areas, each contributing their own flux. So when the spots are on the front, part of the front is cooler. So the flux when the spots are on the front (F_front) is:

F_front = [ (1-f)* (front hemisphere without spots) + f*(front hemisphere with spots) ] / (Total surface area) * σ Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the flux when the spots are on the front and when they're on the back.

Let me define f as the filling factor, which is 0.2. The area of spots is f * (front hemisphere area) = f * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

When the front is spotted, the flux is:

F_front = [ (front hemisphere area without spots) * Teff^4 + (spotted area) * T_spot^4 ] / (Total surface area) * 4π R².

Wait, no, because the flux is the sum of all the areas. The front hemisphere is 2π R². The unspotted part of the front is (2π R²) * (1-f). The spotted part is (2π R²) * f. The back hemisphere is 2π R², all at Teff.

Wait, no. When the front is spotted, the back is unspotted. So the entire front is a mix of spotted and unspotted, but the back is all unspotted.

So the total flux when the front is spotted is:

F_front = [ (front unspotted area) * Teff^4 + (front spotted area) * T_spot^4 + (back area) * Teff^4 ] / (Total area)

Total area is 4π R².

So,

F_front = [ (2π R² (1-f)) * Teff^4 + (2π R² f) * T_spot^4 + (2π R²) * Teff^4 ] / (4π R²)

Simplify numerator:

= [ (2π R² (1-f +1 )) Teff^4 + 2π R² f T_spot^4 ]

= [ 2π R² (2 - f) Teff^4 + 2π R² f T_spot^4 ]

Factor out 2π R²:

= 2π R² [ (2 - f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ]

Divide by 4π R²:

F_front = [ 2π R² [ (2-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] ] / (4π R² )

= [ (2-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * (2π R²) / (4π R² )

Simplify:

= [ (2-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * (1/2 )

So F_front = [ (2 - f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] / 2.

Similarly, when the back is facing us (spotted hemisphere is on the back), the front is all unspotted.

So the flux in that case is:

F_back = [ (front area) Teff^4 + (back area) T_spot^4 ] / (Total area)

Wait no, when the back is spotted, the front is unspotted, but the back is spotted.

So,

F_back = [ (front area) Teff^4 + (back unspotted area) Teff^4 + (back spotted area) T_spot^4 ] / (Total area)

Wait, no. When the back is spotted, the front is unspotted, and the back's area is 2π R², with f fraction being spots.

So,

F_back = [ (front 2π R²) Teff^4 + (back 2π R² (1-f)) Teff^4 + (back 2π R² f) T_spot^4 ] / (4π R² )

= [ 2π R² Teff^4 + 2π R² (1-f) Teff^4 + 2π R² f T_spot^4 ] / (4π R² )

= [ 2π R² [ 1 + (1-f) ] Teff^4 + 2π R² f T_spot^4 ] / (4π R² )

= [ 2π R² (2 - f) Teff^4 + 2π R² f T_spot^4 ] / (4π R² )

Which is the same as F_front. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of when the star is viewed with the unspotted hemisphere, the flux is higher than when the spotted hemisphere is viewed.

Wait, perhaps the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted is facing.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the difference between when the star's overall flux is at its maximum and minimum.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the fractional change in flux caused by the spots when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So, the average flux without any spots is F0 = Teff^4, because the entire star is at Teff. When the front is spotted, the flux is F_front as computed above.

Wait, but in reality, the
