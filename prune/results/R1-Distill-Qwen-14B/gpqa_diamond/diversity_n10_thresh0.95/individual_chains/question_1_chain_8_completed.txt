Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty relation. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for this purpose, it's the order of magnitude that matters.

So the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. But wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if I have a certain uncertainty in time, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional. But in this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. So the lifetimes would relate to the uncertainty in time, right? Because the lifetime is the time during which the system is in that state, and the uncertainty in energy would be the minimum resolution needed to distinguish the two states.

Wait, so the problem is about being able to clearly distinguish two energy levels. That means the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states might appear the same due to the uncertainty.

So each state has its own lifetime. Which one do I use? The lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Hmm, the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) would have a larger energy uncertainty because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt. So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 would be about ħ/(1e-9). For E2, Δt is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is about ħ/(1e-8). But wait, since E2 has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller. So to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the actual energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each state's energy is uncertain within a range. For E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and for E2, it's ΔE2. To clearly distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than that sum, the two might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy is uncertain, but the separation between them needs to be bigger than the individual spreads. Hmm. Let me think about it. Suppose ΔE1 and ΔE2 are the uncertainties for E1 and E2. Then, the energy difference ΔE (E2 - E1) must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to be resolvable. Because if the separation is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, the two states won't overlap. But I'm not exactly certain if it's the sum or just one of them. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation to see.

So, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let's plug in the values for each state.

For E1, Δt = 1e-9 s:
ΔE1 = ħ / (2Δt) → Wait, the uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. So let's compute that.

ΔE1 = ħ/(1e-9) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Wait, but the options are given in eV. So I need to convert this to electron volts. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 in eV is (1.05457e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. That can't be right because 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 is 1.05e-25 J. 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 → let me compute that. 1e-25 / 1e-19 is 1e-6. So 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.56e-7 eV. So about 0.658 microeV or 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, Δt is 1e-8 s, so:

ΔE2 = ħ/(1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.56e-8 eV, which is 0.658 nano-eV.

Wait, but wait a second. The energy difference between E2 and E1 has to be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. So ΔE (E2 - E1) > (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

Wait, but let me think again. The energy levels E1 and E2 are each uncertain within their own ranges. So E1 is approximately E1 ± ΔE1, E2 is approximately E2 ± ΔE2. So for them not to overlap, the minimal separation should be at least the sum of the uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than ΔE1 + ΔE2, then the ranges might overlap, making it impossible to distinguish.

So the required energy difference ΔE (E2 - E1) must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Let me compute that sum.

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV.

Sum: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = (6.58 + 0.658) e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.

Wait, so the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 e-6 eV = 1e-9 eV. That's way smaller than 7e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7e-7. So yes, that would be clearly distinguishable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be at least about 7e-7 eV to be distinguishable. The options given are:

A) 1e-9 → too small.

B) 1e-11 → way too small.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV, which is much larger. So it's definitely resolvable.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV, still smaller than 7e-7.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ΔE as ħ/Δt. Or perhaps it's ħ/(2Δt), or something else. Let me double-check the exact form of the uncertainty principle.

The uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So for the minimum uncertainty, ΔE = ħ/(2Δt). So perhaps I should have used 2Δt in the denominator.

Wait, that would make ΔE = ħ/(2Δt).

Let me recalculate with that.

For E1: Δt = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9) = 1.05e-34 / (2e-9) → 5.27e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-26 / 1.6e-19 = approx 3.29e-7 eV → 0.329e-6 eV.

Similarly, E2: Δt = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8) = 1.05e-34/(2e-8) = 5.27e-27 J.

In eV: 5.27e-27 /1.6e-19 = 3.29e-8 eV → 0.0329e-6 eV.

So sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the minimal required ΔE is about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options again:

C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7. So it's definitely resolvable.

But none of the other options are in that range either. The options are A) 1e-9, B) 1e-11, C) 1e-4, D) 1e-8.

Hmm. So 1e-4 is much larger than 3.6e-7, so it's a valid option.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says the two states have a lifetime of 1e-9 and 1e-8. So perhaps each state's energy uncertainty is determined by its own lifetime. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties.

But if the energy difference is larger than each of their individual uncertainties, would that be enough? Or do we need to account for both?

Wait, if the energy difference is larger than each of the individual uncertainties, but less than the sum, could the two states still overlap? Let me think. Suppose E1 is about E1 ± ΔE1, and E2 is E2 ± ΔE2. So if E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2, then the ranges don't overlap, so they are distinguishable. But if E2 - E1 is less than that sum, then the ranges might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So in this case, with the corrected calculations (using 2Δt), the sum is about 3.6e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV.

Now looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7. So that's definitely sufficient. But none of the other options are in that range. So the correct answer must be C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A) 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-6 eV.

B) 1e-11 eV = 0.000000001 eV.

C) 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV.

D) 1e-8 eV = 0.00000001 eV.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than what we need. So it's definitely sufficient.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute ΔE for E1 again with the correct formula.

Using ΔE = ħ/(2Δt):

ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.27286e-26 J.

Convert to eV: J to eV is divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

So 5.27286e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8) = 1.05e-34/(2e-8) = 5.27e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 /1.6e-19 = 3.29e-8 eV.

So sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = (3.29 + 0.329)e-7 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than ~3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, the only option larger than this is C) 1e-4 eV.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For each state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \cdot 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.27286 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.27286 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \cdot 10^{-8}} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.27286 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.27286 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \, \mu\text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.000001 \, \mu\text{eV} \), which is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Final Answer
The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
