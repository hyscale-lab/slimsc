Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it says. The question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed. It's comparing this to the effect of a planet causing similar brightness changes. Hmm.

Alright, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. The problem mentions that one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spots are at 5000K. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness changes that could look like a planet transiting the star.

The question is, what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do. So we're comparing the effect of the planet's transit to the star's spots.

Wait, the problem says that if the star was not covered by spots, what planet radius would produce the same signal. So we need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Let me think about how these brightness variations work. When a planet transits a star, the planet blocks a part of the star's light. The dip in brightness is proportional to the area blocked. But in this case, the spots are causing a variation as the star rotates. So the effect is rotational modulation.

So how do the spots affect the observed brightness? Well, dark spots on the star's surface will cause a dip in brightness when they are on the visible side. The amount of dip depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference from the rest of the star.

Wait, but the problem says the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are at 5000K. So when the spots are on the side facing us, they contribute less light than the rest of the star.

So the variation in brightness when the star rotates is due to the spots coming into view and going out. The net effect is a periodic dip as the spots rotate into and out of our line of sight.

The amplitude of this dip would depend on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

Similarly, when a planet transits the star, the dip is the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star. So the dip amplitude is (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2), assuming the planet is much smaller than the star so limb darkening effects are minor.

Wait, but the star's spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, the star's total flux is less. So the maximum dip when the spots are entirely on the visible side would be the area of the spots times the difference in brightness per unit area.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the change in flux. Let me model this.

The total flux from the star without any spots is F_total = F_star = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi D^2) ), where D is distance. But I think the exact calculation is to compare relative flux changes, so D would cancel out.

But when the star has spots, the flux is F_total = F_unspotted + F_spots. Wait, no, the spots are cooler, so when they are on the day side, they contribute less. So when the spots rotate into view, the total flux from the star decreases.

Alternatively, think of the star as having a spotted and an unspotted hemisphere. Let's say the star is rotating such that one hemisphere is facing us. So when the spots are on that visible hemisphere, the star's flux is lower.

Wait, the star's radius is Rstar. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi Rstar^2) )? Wait, no. A hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 pi Rstar^2 = 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

Each spot's area is 0.4 pi Rstar^2. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, they contribute less flux.

The flux from the unspotted part of the hemisphere is sigma * Teff^4 * (unspotted area) / (4 pi D^2), and the flux from the spots is sigma * (Teff - delta T)^4 * (spot area) / (4 pi D^2).

But wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000K, but the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K. So the flux from the spots is lower.

Wait, but the star is being observed, and when the spots are on the visible side, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The normal flux without any spots would be F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 Rstar^2 / D^2.

But when spots are visible, the flux is F = F_unspotted + F_spotted.

Compute F_unspotted: area is hemisphere area (2 pi R^2) minus spot area (0.2 * 2 pi R^2) = 0.8 * 2 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2. Wait, no, no. Wait the spot area is 20% of a hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2. So the unspotted area on that hemisphere is 2 pi R^2 - 0.4 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2.

So F_unspotted_flux = sigma * Teff^4 * (1.6 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) → simplify: (1.6 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) = (0.4 R^2)/(D^2). So F_unspotted_flux = sigma Teff^4 * 0.4 R^2 / D^2.

F_spotted_flux = sigma * (5000)^4 * (0.4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) → 0.4 pi R^2 /4 pi D^2 = 0.1 R^2/D^2. So F_spotted_flux = sigma * (5000)^4 * 0.1 R^2 / D^2.

So the total F = F_unspotted + F_spotted = sigma R^2 / D^2 [ 0.4 Teff^4 + 0.1 (5000)^4 ].

Wait, but we need the relative change in flux when the spots are present compared to when the spots are not visible. So the maximum dip occurs when the spots are on the visible hemisphere.

Wait, no, the star's other hemisphere is unspotted. So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is maximum. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower.

So the difference between F_max and F_min would be when the spotted hemisphere is visible. Let me compute F_max and F_min.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the average flux when the star rotates.

But to find the amplitude of the brightness variation, we can compute the difference between when the spots are on the visible side and when they are not. Or more accurately, the change in flux as the star rotates.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's model it as follows: the star has two hemispheres, one spotted (A_spots) and one unspotted (A_unspots). The spotted hemisphere has a lower flux per unit area.

When the star is viewed such that the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspots = sigma Teff^4 * (2 pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) → simplifies to (sigma Teff^4 Rstar^2)/(2 D^2) ).

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The entire star's surface area is 4 pi Rstar^2. Each hemisphere is 2 pi Rstar^2.

When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspots = sigma Teff^4 * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) = Teff^4 * (2 pi R^2) * sigma / (4 pi D^2) ) = (Teff^4 R^2 sigma) / (2 D^2) ) * (2 pi)/(4 pi) )? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the entire star's flux is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 Rstar^2 / D^2.

The flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted = F0 * (area of unspotted part in the visible hemisphere + area of spotted part in the visible hemisphere) / (total area of star).

Wait, no. Because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the unspotted part is on the other side, so not visible. Hmm, perhaps I should model the visible flux as the flux from the visible hemisphere.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions on that hemisphere and the spotted regions.

So the area of the unspotted part on the visible hemisphere is 0.8 * 2 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2. The spotted area is 0.4 pi R^2.

So F_spotted_visible = (sigma (6000)^4 * 1.6 pi R^2 ) + (sigma (5000)^4 * 0.4 pi R^2 ) ) / (4 pi D^2).

Simplify: sigma R^2 / (4 pi D^2 ) [ 1.6 pi (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi (5000)^4 ]

Wait, no, wait. The denominator is 4 pi D^2 because the total surface is 4 pi R^2, but in this case, the visible area is 2 pi R^2 (hemisphere). So perhaps I should compute the flux as follows:

The unspotted part on the visible hemisphere contributes sigma Teff^4 * A_unspotted_visible, divided by 4 pi D^2, same for the spotted part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the flux as:

F_visible = (A_unspotted * Teff^4 + A_spotted * T_spot^4) / (4 pi D^2) * sigma.

But wait, the total area is 4 pi R^2, but when you're looking at a hemisphere, the area is 2 pi R^2. So the visible area is 2 pi R^2, but within that, 20% is spotted and 80% is unspotted.

So A_unspotted_visible = 0.8 * 2 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2.

A_spotted_visible = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So F_visible = [ (1.6 pi R^2) * Teff^4 + (0.4 pi R^2) * (Teff - 1000)^4 ] * sigma / (4 pi D^2).

Simplify:

F_visible = sigma R^2 (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff -1000)^4 ) / (4 D^2) )

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F_unspotted_visible = [ (2 pi R^2) Teff^4 ] * sigma / (4 pi D^2 ) = (sigma Teff^4 R^2 * 2 pi ) / (4 pi D^2 ) → simplifies to (sigma Teff^4 R^2 )/(2 D^2).

So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Wait, no, the variation in brightness is the difference between F_max and F_min, which is F_max - F_min.

But perhaps for the purpose of comparing to the planet transit, we need to compute the fractional change in flux, which is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Wait, but the problem says that the amplitude of the photometric variation caused by the spots is the same as that caused by a planet. So we need to find (F_max - F_min)/F_max equals (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which is the dip caused by the planet.

Wait, no, more accurately, when a planet transits, the dip is (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2). So the fractional dip is (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2).

So, in the case of the spots, the fractional dip is (F_max - F_min) / F_max. So let's compute that.

Compute F_max: when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

F_max = (sigma R^2 Teff^4 * 2 pi ) / (4 pi D^2) ) → (sigma R^2 Teff^4 )/(2 D^2).

F_min: when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

F_min = sigma R^2 [ (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff -1000)^4 ) ] / (4 D^2 )

Wait, wait, let me recompute F_min.

F_min is given by:

F_min = [ (1.6 pi R^2) * Teff^4 + (0.4 pi R^2) * (Teff - 1000)^4 ) ] * sigma / (4 pi D^2 )

Simplify:

= sigma R^2 [ 1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff - 1000)^4 ] / (4 D^2 )

= sigma R^2 [ (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff -1000)^4 ) ] / (4 D^2 )

So F_min = (sigma R^2) [ (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4 ) ] / (4 D^2 )

Compute the terms:

Teff = 6000 K

Teff -1000 =5000 K

Compute 1.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4.

Calculate each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

So 1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Add them: 2.0736e15 + 2.5e14 = 2.3236e15.

So F_min = sigma R^2 * 2.3236e15 / (4 D^2 )

F_max: when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

In that case, the entire hemisphere (2 pi R^2) is at Teff.

So F_max = [2 pi R^2 * sigma Teff^4 ] / (4 pi D^2 ) = [2 pi R^2 * sigma (6e3)^4 ] / (4 pi D^2 )

Simplify: 2 pi R^2 sigma (6e3)^4 / (4 pi D^2 ) = R^2 sigma (6e3)^4 / (2 D^2 )

Which is F_max = sigma R^2 * (1.296e15 ) / (2 D^2 ) = sigma R^2 * 6.48e14 / D^2.

Wait, because 1.296e15 /2 =6.48e14.

Now, compute F_max - F_min.

F_max = 6.48e14 * sigma R^2 / D^2.

F_min = 2.3236e15 * sigma R^2 / (4 D^2 ) → 2.3236e15 /4 = 5.809e14.

So F_min =5.809e14 sigma R^2 / D^2.

So F_max - F_min = (6.48e14 - 5.809e14 ) sigma R^2 / D^2 ) → 0.671e14 sigma R^2 / D^2.

The fractional change is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = (0.671e14 / 6.48e14 ) ) = 0.671 / 6.48 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35%.

Wait, but wait, the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is 10% of the star's flux. But this is the total dip when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible. But the star is rotating, so the spots come into view gradually. Wait, but for the purpose of the problem, it's the amplitude of the variation, which is this dip.

Now, when a planet transits, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar )^2. So we set (Rpl/Rstar )^2 = 0.1035.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, that's approximately 0.32, which is option D, 0.32.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So the answer would be D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a minute. Am I sure about the way the flux is calculated?

Wait another thought: The star's total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is F_max. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_min. The amplitude is the difference between F_max and F_min, which is the dip.

So for the planet, the dip is F_planet = (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F_total, where F_total is the star's flux when the planet is not transiting.

Wait, no. The planet blocks a part of the star, so the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, assuming the planet is much smaller than the star, so we can ignore limb darkening.

So the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = amplitude.

In the spot case, the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = 0.1035, so 0.1035 = (Rpl/Rstar )^2 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the flux changes caused by the spots and compare them to the flux dip caused by a planet transiting the star.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\star} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Spots cover 20% of one hemisphere and are cooler by \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is:
     \[
     F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \frac{4 \pi R_{\star}^2}{4 \pi D^2} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \frac{R_{\star}^2}{D^2}.
     \]
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The spotted hemisphere has:
     - Unspotted area: \( 0.8 \times 2 \pi R_{\star}^2 = 1.6 \pi R_{\star}^2 \).
     - Spotted area: \( 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\star}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\star}^2 \).
   - The flux from the spotted hemisphere is:
     \[
     F_{\text{min}} = \sigma \frac{R_{\star}^2}{D^2} \left( 1.6 T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 T_{\text
