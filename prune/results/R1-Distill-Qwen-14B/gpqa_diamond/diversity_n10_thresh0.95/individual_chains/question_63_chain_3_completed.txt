--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the momentum of a photon that causes a transition from the fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. 

First, I need to understand the model they're using. The problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, actually, the non-rigid rotor is another name for the same thing as the rotation-vibration model. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, the rigid rotor model considers only rotational energy, but the non-rigid one includes both rotational and vibrational states. So the molecule's state can be characterized by both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

But wait, when the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, it's the lowest energy state. For diatomic molecules, the fundamental state is when both the vibrational and rotational energies are at their lowest. So the vibrational quantum number v is 0, and the rotational quantum number J is also 0. Oh wait, is that right? Or is the fundamental state just the lowest vibrational state but rotational could be higher? No, I think the fundamental state is the lowest possible energy, which would be v=0 and J=0. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the rotational state can be higher for the fundamental state. Wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the molecule, which would be the first state when considering all possible quantum states.

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. What's the next state? The next state would be the one with the least energy increase. That could be either an increase in the vibrational quantum number or the rotational.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule considering both rotation and vibration are given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. The rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w_vib + h w_vib v, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0,1,2...).

In the fundamental state, the molecule is in the ground state of both rotation and vibration, so v=0 and J=0. If a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either go to the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the states.

Wait, the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is the vibrational energy spacing, which is h w_vib. The rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is (E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0)) = (ħ²/(2I))(2 - 0) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2. Let's compute both to see which is smaller.

But wait, the problem says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which implies that both rotation and vibration are considered. So the molecule's energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. However, when a photon is absorbed, the energy can go into either rotation, vibration, or both. But the question is about the "next state with the lowest possible energy". So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the smallest possible transition.

So I need to find the energy difference between the current state (v=0, J=0) and the next possible state. The next possible state could be either J=1 (same v) or v=1 (same J). So I need to calculate the energy for both transitions and see which is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the first excited state, which could be either rotational or vibrational. But the problem states that the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy must match the smallest possible energy transition.

Wait, the photon's energy will have to match the difference between the initial and final states. So the energy of the photon E_photon = E_final - E_initial.

So to find which transition is possible, we need to compute E_final for both J=1 and v=1, then see which one is the smaller energy difference.

So let's compute the rotational energy difference and the vibrational energy difference.

First, the vibrational energy difference: when v goes from 0 to 1.

E_vib = h w_vib (from v=0 to v=1: 1 * h w).

The rotational energy difference when J goes from 0 to 1.

E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1) - (previous J=0 term, which is 0). So E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2.

Hmm, I need to compute both E_vib and E_rot.

Let me calculate the rotational moment of inertia I. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) 

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.015e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 3.015e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.014, yeah.

So, I = μ r².

r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So r = 2e-10 m.

r squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.015e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy difference for J=0 → J=1 is E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2.

Wait, ħ is h-bar, which is h/(2π). Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So ħ = 6.626e-34 / (2 * π) ≈ 1.054e-34 J s.

So E_rot = ( (1.054e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.206e-46 ) ) * 2.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1.054e-34)^2 ≈ 1.11e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.206e-46 = 2.412e-46.

So (1.11e-68) / (2.412e-46) ) ≈ 4.6e-23.

Multiply by 2: 4.6e-23 * 2 = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2.

Wait, (ħ^2)/(2I) is the term for J=0 (since E_rot = (ħ^2/(2I)) J (J+1)), so for J=1, it's (ħ²/(2I)) * 2. So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is ( ħ²/(2I) )(2 - 0 ) = 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's recalculate.

E_rot difference = (ħ²/(2I)) * [ J(J+1) - J_initial(J_initial+1) ].

Here, J_initial is 0, so J_initial+1=1, but J_initial is 0. So J_initial(J_initial+1)=0.

J_final is 1, so J_final (J_final +1) = 2.

So the difference is (ħ²/(2I)) (2 - 0) )= (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

So E_rot = (ħ^2) / I.

Wait, no:

Wait, E_rot for J=1 is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I). E_rot for J=0 is 0.

So the difference is ħ²/(I). So E_rot = ħ²/(I).

Wait, earlier I thought it was 9.2e-23 J. Let me recalculate that.

I have I =1.206e-46 kg m².

So ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (approx 1.112e-68) J² s².

So ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.206e-46) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the vibrational energy difference when v=0 to v=1 is E_vib = h w (since v increases by 1, so E = (v+1) h w - v h w = h w).

Given w = 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

So comparing E_rot (9.2e-23 J) and E_vib (2.65e-19 J), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition, which is smaller.

Wait, but wait. Are we considering that the molecule can only change either vibration or rotation, or can it change both? Because if the photon's energy is exactly the rotational energy, the transition would be a pure rotation. But I think in the case of the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the least energy increment, which is the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy must be E_photon = E_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the options are given in terms of momentum p, not energy. So the problem is asking for the momentum of the photon, not the energy. So I need to find p such that E_photon = p c, since for a photon, E = pc.

Wait, yes, because the energy of a photon is E = pc, where p is momentum and c is speed of light.

So p = E_photon / c.

E_photon is 9.2e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.067e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, wait, the units given are Ns. Ns is the same as kg m/s, which is the unit for momentum (since p = F*t, and F in N, t in s gives kg m/s). So p is in kg m/s, which is same as Ns.

So my calculation of p is about 3e-31 kg m/s, but the options are much larger.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in calculating E_rot. Because 3e-31 Ns is not among the options. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing I. Let me re-examine that.

I = μ r².

μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 *2 )/(20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

Wait, yes, that's right. Then r is 2 angstroms. 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Wait, that's correct.

Now, E_rot = ħ²/(I). ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s.

So E_rot = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.206e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (1.206e-46) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, that's correct.

So E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

Then p = E_photon / c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = about 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are close to that. So either I'm missing something, or the approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the next state is the first energy level above the fundamental. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy, which could be either J=0 and v=1 (vibrational transition) or J=1 and v=0 (rotational). So which one has a lower energy.

Wait, I computed E_rot ≈9.2e-23 J and E_vib ≈2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy, so it's the lower energy photon.

But the options are all much larger than 3e-31 Ns. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the energy. Let me recalculate E_rot. Let me write down each step.

Compute E_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) * (J=1)(J=1+1) - (J=0)(J=0+1)).

Wait, no, earlier I thought E_rot for J=1 is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2, so the difference from J=0 (which is 0) is 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

Wait, yes, so I did that correctly.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy. Did I get that right?

E_vib = h w (v+½) - h w (v + ½). Wait, no, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + ½) h w, so the difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the question is, the photon's energy is either E_rot or E_vib. Which transition is possible? The photon's energy must match either E_rot or E_vib.

But since E_rot is much smaller, the photon's energy is determined by the rotational transition.

So p_photon = E_photon / c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3e-31 kg m/s = 3e-31 Ns.

But in the options, the smallest is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is about 1e-28, which is larger by a factor of 1e7.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation of E_rot?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the moment of inertia. Let me recheck.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Yes. 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.015e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of w, the angular frequency? Or maybe the vibrational frequency is given as w, but the rotational frequency is different.

Wait, in the problem, w is the angular frequency of vibration. So the rotational frequency isn't given. So my earlier approach is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in E_rot.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the lowest vibrational state (v=0) but has some rotational state. Wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest state, which would be v=0 and J=0.

Wait, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotation and vibration, but in this problem, the photon is causing a transition that affects both.

Wait, but the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, and the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the next state could be either a higher J or higher v, but whichever requires the least energy.

But according to my earlier calcs, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is E_rot = 9.2e-23 J, leading to p_photon = 3e-31 Ns. But none of the options are anywhere near that.

Wait, perhaps I should instead use the reduced mass in a different way. Or maybe the given w is for the rotational frequency?

Wait, the problem states that w is the angular frequency of vibration. So no, that should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the next energy state when considering both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state might involve increasing J by 1 (so J=1, v=0), or increasing v by 1 (v=1, J=0). The energy of each transition is E_rot and E_vib, as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule can only undergo a vibrational transition, not a rotational. But why would that be? Because in some models, rotation is considered as a separate mode, but the problem states it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so both are considered.

Wait, maybe the photon's energy needs to supply both the rotational and vibrational energy. No, that doesn't make sense because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the smallest energy increase is the rotational transition.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me re-calculate that.

Compute E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1) with J=1.

But for J=0, it's 0. So the difference is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

So let's compute ħ²/(I).

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

I = 1.206e-46 kg m².

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Divide that by 1.206e-46 kg m².

1.112e-68 / 1.206e-46 = approx 9.22e-23 J.

Yes, same as before.

So E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are all in the order of 1e-28 Ns or larger, which is about 1e7 times larger than my result.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me check again.

I = μ * r².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 = approx 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.015e-27 kg. Correct.

r is 2e-10 m. So r squared is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m². Correct.

Hmm. Maybe the question is about the next state in terms of energy, considering that the rotational energy for J=1 is higher than the vibrational for v=1? But that contradicts my earlier calculation. Or perhaps the energy levels are such that the vibrational transition is the next state. Let me recheck the energy values.

E_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

E_vib = 2.65e-19 J.

So 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 2.65e-19.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units when calculating E_rot. Let me check the units.

E_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) * J(J+1).

Units: ħ is J s. I is kg m². So (J² s²) / (kg m²) ) * unitless.

J² s² / (kg m²) = (kg² m²/s² s²) ) / (kg m²) ) → kg m²/s² → which is Joules. Correct.

So units are correct.

So why do the options not match?

Wait, perhaps the photon's momentum is being calculated with a different approach. Maybe instead of E = pc, perhaps I should consider the momentum in terms of angular momentum or something else. No, for photons, E = pc holds.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model is such that the energy levels are only vibrational, and the rotation is considered as part of the vibrational model. No, the question says it's a rotation-vibration model, so both are considered.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next energy level, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational transitions. But the problem states the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one with the smallest energy difference, which is the rotational transition.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm missing something about the quantum numbers.

Wait, maybe the rotational transition isn't possible because for a diatomic molecule, the selection rules state that ΔJ = ±1, and for vibrational transitions Δv = ±1. But the question is about the next state, so maybe the molecule can only transition to J=1 and v=0 (rotational transition) or J=0 and v=1 (vibrational transition). And the energy required for rotational is lower.

So the photon's energy is E_rot = 9.2e-23 J, leading to p = 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to see if I can get one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1.1e-27 Ns.

If I compute p = 1.1e-27 Ns, then E = p c = 1.1e-27 * 3e8 = 3.3e-19 J.

Wait, that's close to E_vib which was 2.65e-19 J. But 3.3e-19 is a bit higher.

But perhaps the calculation includes other factors, like the reduced mass, or perhaps the photon's energy isn't just the rotational or vibrational part but a combination. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers a transition to v=1 and J=1, but that would require much higher energy.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the transition is from J=0 to J=1, but in the same vibrational state, which requires the rotational energy, but perhaps the calculation includes the vibrational energy as well. No, the photon's energy should match the energy difference between the states.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the vibrational energy and see if any of the options match.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = E_vib / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, which is about a fifth of my result. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is roughly half.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the Raman transition, which involves two-photon processes, but that's probably beyond what's needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to match the rotational energy, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using the rotational constant B. The rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2I), and the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1). So the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is 2B.

Wait, B = ħ²/(2I) → E_rot = 2B = ħ²/(I).

Which is the same as before.

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.206e-46) ) = (1.112e-68 ) / 2.412e-46 ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

So E_rot = 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

So same result.

Another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first excited vibrational state, which requires E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J, which gives p_photon = 8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both vibration and rotation, but the energy difference is not additive. But I don't think that's the case; the problem states that the next state has the lowest possible energy, which would be the rotational transition.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy to come from the vibrational part, but I have a calculation mistake. Let me compute p_photon for E_vib again.

E_vib = 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = E_vib / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, which is about a fifth of this. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is about half.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I used the correct units for r. Wait, r is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Yes, correct.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is using the bond length in a different way, or perhaps the reduced mass is different. Let me recheck μ.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) =40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the exact value of 1 amu as 1.660539e-27 kg instead of 1.66e-27. Let me see what that gives.

μ =1.818 * 1.660539e-27 kg = let's compute:

1.818 * 1.660539 = approx 3.0148e-27 kg.

Which is same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculated p_photon for the rotational transition is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. But the vibrational transition gives p_photon of 8.8e-28 Ns, which is closer to option A (1.9e-28) or D (1.4e-28).

Wait, maybe the problem is that the photon's energy is E_rot + E_vib for some reason, but that would be even larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=1, but considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), so the photon's energy is just E_rot.

But in that case, the p_photon is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum photon momentum, not the minimum. No, the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, so that would be the minimum photon energy, leading to the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recompute I.

I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = 1.818 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.015e-27 kg.

r² =4e-20 m².

I =3.015e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.206e-46 kg m².

So that's correct. So E_rot = ħ²/(I) = 9.22e-23 J.

Hmm. Maybe the problem uses a different value for h or c. Let me see.

If I use h = 6.626e-34 J s, c=3e8 m/s.

But I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the momentum as hbar * something.

Wait, another approach: The energy of a photon is E = h f = h (w/(2π)), because w = 2πf.

Wait, for the rotational transition, the frequency f_rot is such that E_rot = h f_rot → f_rot = E_rot / h.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Wait, E_rot = 9.22e-23 J.

f_rot = E_rot / h = (9.22e-23 J) / (6.626e-34 J s) ≈ 1.39e11 Hz.

But that's not directly helpful for momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the wavelength lambda = h/(p), but since p = E/c, it's the same as before.

I'm not making progress here. Let me think again.

The only way I can reconcile the calculated p with the options is if the transition is a vibrational one, but the p I calculated is 8.8e-28 Ns, and option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy as the required photon energy, but I'm missing a factor of 4. Let me see: 8.8e-28 *4 = 3.5e-27, which is close to option B (2.3e-27) or C (1.1e-27). No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first excited state in terms of both rotation and vibration, but that would require a much higher energy.

Wait, maybe the problem is mixing the rotational and vibrational frequencies. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the transition to the next available state, which could involve a combination of rotation and vibration, but that's not likely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the rigid rotor, where the moment of inertia is treated as a constant, but even then, the calculation should be similar.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the transition from J=1 to J=2, but that's higher energy, which would not be the next state.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the next state is the first vibrational state, but that would require a much higher photon energy, which again doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing up the rotational and vibrational frequencies. For example, if the angular frequency given (w) is for rotation, then E_rot would be hbar w, but that's not the case here.

Wait, the problem states that w is the angular frequency of vibration, so that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the option that is closest to the vibrational transition's momentum, which is around 8.8e-28 Ns. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

So 8.8e-28 is closest to option A, but it's about 4.6 times larger than option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in E_vib. Let me re-calculate E_vib.

E_vib = h * w.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_vib =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

p_photon = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Which is about 4.6 times option A (1.9e-28), and option D is1.4e-28, which is about a sixth.

So none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects the rotational transition but I made a mistake in the E_rot calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the rotational energy is quantized, but the vibrational is not. Or perhaps the problem expects the use of the vibrational energy, not the rotational.

Wait, perhaps the given options are for the vibrational transition, but I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to match the rotational energy, but with a different calculation. Let me try to compute E_rot again.

E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2.

Because J goes from 0 to 1, so J=1 gives 2 units.

Wait, no, the formula is E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) * J (J+1).

So for J=1, E = (ħ²/(2I)) *2.

So difference from J=0 (0) is 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational transition, but that would lead to a higher momentum than any of the options. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula E = (1/2) h w for the vibrational energy, but no, the vibrational energy is E_vib = h w (v+1/2) - h w (v +1/2) when v increases by 1. But the energy difference is h w.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition for the rigid rotor model, which neglects vibration. But the question says it's the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) but in some rotational state, but the question says it's in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to compute which option would give E_rot.

For example, let's compute what E would be for option C: p=1.1e-27 Ns.

E = p c =1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J.

Which is more than E_vib=2.65e-19 J.

But the rotational transition is much lower. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy again using different constants.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of ħ. Let me compute E_rot with more precise numbers.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

I=1.206e-46 kg m².

E_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.206e-46) = let's calculate exactly.

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112019e-68.

Divide by 1.206e-46: 1.112019e-68 / 1.206e-46 = 9.22e-23 J.

Same as before.

So p_photon = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match.

Hmm. Maybe the question is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is about the dissociation energy or something else. Or maybe I've confused the selection rules.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum in terms of the rotational energy. But I don't see how that would change anything.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a diatomic molecule where the reduced mass is calculated differently. Let me see: For a diatomic molecule, the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=1 to J=0, but that's emission, not absorption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the photon's momentum is zero. No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition to J=2, but that would require higher energy.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the options, the only one that's in the same ballpark as the vibrational transition is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). But I'm not seeing how to get those.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using the vibrational angular frequency, which would be a mistake, but perhaps that's what the question expects.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The rotational and vibrational frequencies are different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula E_rot = h c / lambda, but that's the same as E=pc.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy in terms of wavelength. But I don't see how that would help.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is assuming that the photon's momentum is the same as the change in angular momentum of the molecule. But for a photon, momentum p is related to angular momentum J by J = r × p. But I'm not sure.

Wait, for a photon, angular momentum L = r × p. So L = r × p.

In this case, r is the bond length, 2e-10 m.

So p = E_photon / c.

So L = (2e-10 m) × (E_photon/c) ).

But I don't know if that helps.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the photon's momentum in terms of the molecule's moment of inertia. But I don't see a direct relation.

I'm running out of ideas. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns, which is close to the vibrational transition's p_photon if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, if the vibrational transition's p is 8.8e-28 Ns, and option C is 1.1e-27, which is about 12.5 times larger. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the rotational energy divided by c, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next vibrational state, which would require p_photon = E_vib/c = 8.83e-28 Ns. But none of the options are close. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to be the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy. But that would be much higher.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in terms of J, not in terms of energy. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is talking about the next state with the next higher J, regardless of energy. But that would make the photon's energy E_rot, but again, the options don't match.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = h / lambda, but also considering the energy difference as E = h w_rot, where w_rot is the rotational angular frequency. But I don't have w_rot provided.

Wait, the given w is the vibrational frequency. So unless I can compute the rotational frequency from other parameters, perhaps I can't proceed. But how?

The rotational frequency is related to the moment of inertia and the rotational constant B. The rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I).

The rotational frequency w_rot would be related to B. For a rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and the spacing between J and J+1 is 2B (J+1), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the rotational frequency can be found from B = h/(8 π² c I), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the rotational frequency is w_rot = sqrt(k / μ), but that's the vibrational frequency. No, the vibrational frequency is given by w_vib = sqrt(k/μ), where k is the force constant.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the photon's energy must match the difference between the first excited state (v=1, J=0) and the fundamental state (v=0, J=0). So E_photon = E_vib = h w.

Which would give p_photon = h w / c = (6.626e-34 *4e14) /3e8 = (2.65e-19)/3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

But again, this doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first state where both v and J increase, but that would be a higher energy.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the options, I think the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns, which is 1.1e-27 kg m/s. But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ. Let me double-check.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is in picometers? 2 angstroms is 200 pm. No, the question says 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure how to arrive at that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is using the formula for the photon's energy as E = (1/2) h w_rot, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition as ΔJ=2, but that's not likely.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = (hbar * k), where k is the wavevector. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, E = pc = ħ k c. So p = E /c = ħ k.

But again, without knowing k, I can't proceed.

Hmm. I think I'll have to go with the calculation that the photon's energy is E_rot =9.2e-23 J, leading to p_photon =3e-31 Ns. But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns, which corresponds to E_photon =5.7e-20 J. Which is higher than E_rot but lower than E_vib.

Wait, 5.7e-20 J is between E_rot and E_vib. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes, but that would require more energy than either.

Hmm. I'm really not sure. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not confident.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the molecule from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Parameters:
- **Mass of atom X (Mx):** 20 amu  
- **Mass of atom Y (My):** 2 amu  
- **Bond length (r):** 2 Å = \(2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)  
- **Vibrational angular frequency (\(w\)):** \(4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\)  

### Step 1: Reduced Mass (\(\mu\))
The reduced mass is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
\]
Converting to kilograms:
\[
\mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.015 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]

### Step 2: Moment of Inertia (\(I\))
The moment of inertia for the diatomic molecule is:
\[
I = \mu r^2 = (3.015 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Rotational Energy Transition
The rotational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1),
\]
where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). The energy difference for the transition from \(J=0\) to \(J=1\) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) - E_{\text{rot}}(J=0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.206 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Vibrational Energy Transition
The vibrational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{1}{2} h \omega + h \omega v,
\]
where the energy difference for the transition from \(v=0\) to \(v=1\) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 5: Photon Momentum
The energy of the photon must match the energy difference of the transition. Since the rotational transition (\(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)) requires less energy than the vibrational transition (\(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)), the photon's energy corresponds to the rotational transition.

The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:
\[
p = \frac{E}{c},
\]
where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}}\):
\[
p = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
\]

### Step 6: Comparison with Options
The calculated momentum (\(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}\)) does not match any of the provided options. However, the vibrational transition corresponds to a momentum:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
\]
This value is closest to **Option A (\(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\))**, though it is approximately 4.6 times smaller. Given the discrepancy, the most reasonable choice is **Option C (\(1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s}\))**, which aligns with the vibrational transition when accounting for potential approximations or errors in the problem setup.

ANSWER: C
