Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal too, so it's a special case of a hexagonal system or maybe a cubic system? Wait, no, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. Right, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles α, β, γ are all the same. So in this case, they're giving that all angles are 30 degrees each.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance (d) is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - hk( (cos α)/(cos β) ) - ... wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think there's a better formula for this.

Wait, another approach. Oh, right, for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is found using the formula derived from the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. But for non-cubic systems, it's more complicated because the angles between the axes matter.

The general formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is:

d = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - a² (hk (cos γ) + hl (cos β) + kl (cos α)) ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I think the formula is d = (1/√( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk (cos α + cos β + cos γ) ) )) ) multiplied by something involving the lattice constant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, right, for a rhombohedral system, since all angles are equal (α=β=γ=θ), the formula simplifies.

I remember that the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Because in a cubic system, the formula is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but rhombohedral must involve the angles. So, when the angles are 90 degrees, cosθ is zero, and it reduces to the cubic case. So that makes sense.

In this problem, the angles are all 30 degrees, so cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. The Miller indices are (111), so h=k=l=1.

Plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*cos30)

Wait, let's compute the denominator step by step.

First, compute h² + k² + l²: 1 + 1 + 1 =3.

Then compute 2*(hk + hl + kl): 2*(1+1+1)=6.

Multiply by cosθ: 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) )= 6*(0.8660) ≈5.196.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 -5.196). Wait, that's 3 -5.196= -2.196. Oh wait, that can't be right because square root of a negative number is not real. That must mean I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. Maybe I mixed up the signs. Let me double-check the formula.

Ah, yes! I think I got the formula wrong. The correct formula involves a sum where the angles are subtracted. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh yeah, the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angles are all equal, so the formula simplifies. So plugging in h=1, k=1, l=1, a=10 Angstrom, θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2 ≈ 0.866.

Compute the denominator:

h² + k² + l² = 3.

2(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1 +1 +1) =6.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 -6 * cosθ.

Which is 3 -6*(0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196.

Wait, negative. That can't be. So that would mean no real solution, but that can't be right because the (111) plane must exist. So I must have the formula wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I should have a different approach. I think I should look at the structure factor or maybe the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the general formula for interplanar distance.

The general formula for any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h a* )² + (k b* )² + (l c* )² )

Where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal lattice parameters.

But for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0 (let's say a0 is 10 Angstrom), and the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors might be the same as the crystal angles but with a certain relation.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

a* = (1/a) (sinβγ, sinαγ, sinαβ) / (sinα sinβ sinγ)

Wait that's getting complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vectors in a rhombohedral system can be written in terms of the original lattice vectors, but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe another way. The interplanar distance can be found using:

d = a / |n|,

where |n| is the magnitude of the vector in the reciprocal space for the given plane.

But for a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

n = h a* + k b* + l c*.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral crystal is:

G = [ a² (1, cosγ, cosγ),
       cosγ, a² (1, cosγ, cosγ),
       cosγ, cosγ, a² (1, cosγ, cosγ) ]

Wait, no, maybe the metric tensor G is a 3x3 matrix where each element is:

G_ij = a² δ_ij + a² cosθ for i≠j.

In this case, since all angles are 30 degrees, cosθ is √3/2.

So for rhombohedral, G matrix is:

[ a²      a² cosθ      a² cosθ ]
[ a² cosθ  a²          a² cosθ ]
[ a² cosθ a² cosθ      a²       ]

Because all angles are the same.

The reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by G*, so the reciprocal basis vectors are determined by inverting G.

The reciprocal metric determinant is |G| = a^6 (1 - 3 cosθ² + 2 cos^3θ )

Wait, but maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Ah, wait a second. Maybe the correct formula is:

d = (a ) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But wait, with θ being the angle between the axes, which in this case is 30 degrees. So plugging in h=1, k=1, l=1:

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2*(1+1+1) * cos(30)).

So cos(30)=√3/2 ≈0.866.

Compute inside the sqrt:

3 - 6 * 0.866 = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. That can't be possible. So that suggests I made a mistake in the formula. Because the interplanar distance can't be imaginary.

Hmm, maybe the formula is actually:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But in this scenario, the denominator is negative, which can't be. So perhaps I have the formula backward.

Wait, maybe the formula should be:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Because that way, for θ=90 degrees, it becomes a/sqrt(h^2 +k^2 +l^2), which is correct.

Wait, let's test that. If I plug in θ=90, then cosθ=0, and formula is a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct for cubic systems. So that makes sense.

But the problem is, in our case, θ=30°, so cosθ is positive. So let's try that.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6 cosθ).

Wait, 3 + 6*(√3/2) = 3 + 3√3 ≈ 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d = 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10 / 2.863 ≈3.492 Angstroms. But wait, none of the options are around 3.5. The options are around 8-10 Angstroms. So that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Another approach: perhaps using the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters.

In a rhombohedral system, the volume V = a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos²θ + 2 cos^3θ). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, another formula I found elsewhere: the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system (hkl) is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But earlier that gave a negative denominator. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe I should use the general formula for interplanar distance, which is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2) ) + (k^2 (1/b^2) ) + (l^2 (1/c^2)
