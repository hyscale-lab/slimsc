Okay, I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let's break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to become 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones via some kind of nucleophilic substitution. Oh wait, the reaction of ketones with CN- is likely a nucleophilic addition. In the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

So for the first reaction: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which provides CN- ions, and some acid A, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed addition. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but I thought when a ketone reacts with CN- under acid conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. Oh right! The cyanohydrin formation. The ketone attacks CN- in an acid environment, leading to the addition of a -OH and a -CN group on the same carbon.

So the reagent A must be an acid, like H3O+ (which is a common acid catalyst, like in the formation of cyanohydrins). So in the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now for the second reaction: the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And the reagent B is H2O, but looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid. So, nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? Oh, right, you hydrolyze the nitrile. The typical way to do that is to first convert the nitrile to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under strong acidic or basic conditions. Alternatively, under reflux with H2O and acid or base.

Wait, but the reagent here is just B (H2O). Wait, the question says the reagent is B, and it's H2O. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, but using H2O as the reagent. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, but the reagents we're choosing are options. The options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So when it's hydrolyzed, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. The hydroxyl group might be involved in some way, perhaps in the mechanism.

Let me think about the reaction conditions. The nitrile group (CN) can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under certain conditions. The typical conditions are either strong acid or strong base. For example, in acidic conditions, with H2SO4 and H2O, maybe with heat. Or in basic conditions, like with aqueous NaOH and heat.

Wait, but the product here is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must proceed all the way to the acid. So the conditions should be strong enough. Acidic or basic.

Wait, but in the second part of the problem, the reagents are B, which is H2O and another reagent. Oh wait, no, looking again: in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O, but I think the question says 'B (H2O)' meaning that B is part of the reagent. Oh, wait no, I think the question says 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to produce the acid. So the reagent is H2O, but I might have misread it. Wait, no, the second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) --> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me check the question again.

The second reaction: reagent B is H2O. So the reagent used is H2O, but perhaps in combination with something else. Oh wait, no. The question says the reagent is B, which is H2O. So the reaction is treated with H2O as a reagent, but probably in a specific condition.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me parse the question again.

The first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

The second reaction: the product from the first reaction (but wait, no, the second reaction's starting material is a different compound, which is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)... butanenitrile. So the second reaction is with reagent B, which is H2O. But wait, that can't be right because H2O as a reagent alone might not be enough for nitrile hydrolysis. So perhaps B is something else, and the reagent is H2O and B? Wait, no, the way the question is written is a bit unclear. Let me look again.

The question says:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Ah, right, so B is the reagent, and the reagent is H2O. Wait, no, the way the equation is written is that the reagent is B and the solvent is H2O. Or perhaps B is in addition to H2O? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reagent is B, which is H2O, but that's not likely because H2O is a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is another reagent, and the reaction is conducted in H2O.

Wait, I'm a bit confused by the way the question is written. Let me reread the setup.

The first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

So A is a reagent.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, the way it's written seems to indicate that the reagent is B, and the reaction is done in H2O. So B is the reagent, and the solvent is H2O. Or perhaps the reagent is B, which is H2O? Not sure, but perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

In any case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis.

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acid or strong base, often with heat.

So for the second reaction, we need a condition that facilitates the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, the options for B are either HCl, CH3COOH, NaHSO3, etc.

Wait, the options give for B either HCl, CH3COOH, or HCl with other reagents.

Wait, the options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Wait, in the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl or another acid.

Wait, but let's think about the possible reagents for nitrile hydrolysis.

One method is using H2O with HCl, perhaps under reflux. Another is using H2O with NaOH (strong base), but that would give a carboxylate, which would then need acid workup to get the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the product is the carboxylic acid, so maybe the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl, which would provide the acidic environment for hydrolysis.

So looking at the options, for the second reaction, B is either HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D).

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, while CH3COOH is a weak acid.

In the first reaction, A is H3O+ (from HCl, H2SO4, etc.), which is an acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+; looking at options, A is either H3O+ in options A and B, or NaHSO3 in C and D.

So right now, I think A is H3O+ because the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which requires an acid catalyst.

So A is H3O+, which is in options A and B.

Now, for the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So which acid would facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid?

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under strongly acidic conditions, like with concentrated sulfuric acid and heat, or in the presence of HCl with water and heat.

Alternatively, under basic conditions, like with aqueous NaOH and then acid workup.

But given the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Which is more likely? I think HCl would be a stronger acid, making the reaction proceed more effectively. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so perhaps it's not strong enough for efficient hydrolysis.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group adjacent. So maybe the conditions need to be such that the hydroxyl group doesn't interfere.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis is taking place via the hydroxyl group. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure.

The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is:

CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-...

Wait, more accurately, it's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure would be:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? Or something along those lines.

But when hydrolyzed, the nitrile (CN) becomes a COOH group. So the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the hydroxyl group is on the same carbon as the COOH.

Wait, but in that case, perhaps the hydrolysis is happening via a ketone intermediate. Wait, no, because the starting material is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, maybe the hydroxyl group is part of a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: what reagents are used in the cyanohydrin formation and the subsequent hydrolysis.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN and acid → cyanohydrin. So A is the acid, likely H3O+ (so options A and B). So options C and D are ruled out because their A is NaHSO3, which may not be the right catalyst for that reaction.

Now, for the second reaction, the reagent is B. It's either HCl or CH3COOH (options A and B, respectively).

Which acid is suitable for hydrolyzing the nitrile to the acid? Let's think about the reaction conditions.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done using concentrated HCl with water and heat. For example, the Stephen reduction uses HCl for certain reactions, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done in HCl, often under reflux.

Alternatively, using H2O with HCl as the acid catalyst.

So if B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed under acidic conditions, leading to the carboxylic acid.

If B were CH3COOH, a weak acid, it might not provide enough acidity, and the reaction might not proceed as effectively.

Therefore, for the second reaction, we need a strong acid, which is HCl. So B is HCl, which is option A or C. But since we've determined that A is H3O+, which is option A or B. Wait, no: looking back, the options are:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

So if B is HCl, then the correct option is A.

But wait, why would the second reagent be HCl? Because the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be in an acidic aqueous solution.

So for the second reaction, the reagent is B = HCl. So the correct option is option A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

If I take the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → forms the cyanohydrin. That makes sense because the acid (H3O+) would protonate the ketone, making it a better electrophile for the CN- attack. So yes, A is H3O+.

In the second reaction, the nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So in that case, the reagent would be HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B). Which is more suitable?

I recall that HCl is a strong acid and can provide the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis. CH3COOH is a weaker acid and might not be sufficient. So for efficient hydrolysis, especially in cases where the nitrile is less reactive, a strong acid like HCl would be better.

Therefore, the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl. Looking at the options, that's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about the second reaction: if the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, would the reaction proceed differently? Like, perhaps the hydroxyl group could form a hemiacetal or something that affects the reactivity.

Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl is part of a protecting group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the presence of the hydroxyl group might make the molecule more polar, but it shouldn't affect the acid strength needed for the hydrolysis.

So I think my initial conclusion stands: the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.


The question involves determining the suitable reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the ketone, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. The most common acid catalyst for this reaction is **H₃O⁺**. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction is likely carried out under acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** provides the strong acidic environment needed for efficient hydrolysis. **CH₃COOH**, being a weak acid, is less effective for this transformation. Therefore, **B = HCl**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions.  
- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While A is correct, B is not suitable as CH₃COOH is a weak acid and less effective for nitrile hydrolysis.  
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is not a suitable catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.  
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Neither A nor B is suitable for the respective reactions.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
