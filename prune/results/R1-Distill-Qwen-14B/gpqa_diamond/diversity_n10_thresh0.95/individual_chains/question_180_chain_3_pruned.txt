Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy has to do with the arrangement of charges. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So I guess point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from it. But wait, the other 12 are fixed at 2 meters from P, but are they arranged in a particular way? Maybe it's a sphere or something, but perhaps I don't need to know the exact arrangement because the potential energy for each depends on their distance from the fixed charge.

Wait, no, the system is isolated, so all the charges are either at P or at 2m from P. But the 12 charges are each at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th, plus the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem asks for the minimum energy. So I need to consider the configuration that gives the lowest possible potential energy. Since potential energy for like charges is positive when they are close, the minimum energy would probably involve arranging the charges as close as possible, but in this case, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. Oh, so their positions relative to each other aren't being changed. So the 12 are fixed at 2 meters from P, but what about their arrangement among themselves?

Ah, but the problem says the system is isolated, so perhaps the charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are as small as possible, but given that they're each fixed at 2 meters from P. Wait, no—maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point 2 meters away from P, but that's not possible because they're identical and would repel each other. So perhaps they are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are as large as possible, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed at a distance of 2m from P. So their mutual distances might vary, but perhaps the problem is only considering their distance from P, not from each other.

Wait, but for the potential energy of the system, we have to consider all pairs. So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So for each of the 12 charges, their contribution to the potential energy comes from their interaction with the fixed charge at P, and also from their interactions with each other.

But wait, the fixed charge is at P, so each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P. So the potential energy between each 12th charge and the fixed one is (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m). But how many such pairs are there? There are 12 charges each interacting with the fixed one, so 12 pairs.

Then, for the interactions between the 12 charges themselves, each pair contributes (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * d_ij), where d_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j. But since the 12 are arranged at 2m from P, their mutual distances depend on how they're positioned around P. To minimize the total potential energy, I think we need the mutual distances to be as large as possible because potential energy for like charges is positive and increases as they get closer. So arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the total mutual potential energy.

Wait, but wait. No—wait, since all the 12 charges are positive (since each is 2e and e is positive), placing them as far apart as possible would result in the least mutual repulsion, which would minimize the potential energy (since each pair would have the least possible potential energy, which is the lowest possible for the system). So the configuration of the 12 charges would be such that each is as far as possible from the others, but since they're all at a fixed distance from P, perhaps the optimal arrangement is that they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, spaced as far apart as possible. That would probably be in a regular icosahedron arrangement or something similar, but maybe for simplicity, the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is equally spaced around P, perhaps forming a regular polyhedron.

But wait, calculating the exact potential energy between all pairs of the 12 charges would be complicated because I'd have to know each d_ij. However, maybe the problem is simplifying the situation by considering the potential energy only between the 12th charge and the fixed one, and not considering the mutual interactions between the 12th charges. Or perhaps the distances between the 12 charges are much smaller than 2m, making their mutual potential energies significant. But without more information, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed one, not the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.

Wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the system's potential energy is being minimized when the mutual potential energies are as small as possible, which would happen when the charges are as far apart as possible. But given that the 12 charges are all fixed at 2m from P, perhaps the mutual potential energy can't be zero; it's fixed by their arrangement. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge at P, and not the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So their arrangement is fixed in terms of distance from P, but their mutual distances are not given. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge, and not the mutual potential energies between the 12. But that seems unlikely because the system's potential energy must include all pairs. Hmm, but maybe the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges are negligible or perhaps it's a trick question.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all located at the same point 2 meters away from P, but that's impossible because they would repel each other and can't be in the same point. So that can't be the case. So the problem must require considering all possible pairs.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps each of the 12 is located on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But how many points can you place on a sphere with each point at least some minimal distance apart? Well, 12 points would form a regular icosahedron, but I'm not sure. However, calculating the exact potential energy for each pair would be complicated, so perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are such that each pair is separated by a distance that is much larger than 2m, making their contributions negligible. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to model the problem.

Total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs of (q_i q_j)/(4πε₀ r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between i and j.

In this case, the 13 charges are:

- Charge 1: at P (fixed)
- Charges 2-13: each at distance 2m from P.

So for each of the charges 2-13, their distance to charge 1 is 2m.

For the pairs between charges 2-13, their distance varies depending on their arrangement around P.

But the problem says "the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So perhaps each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. For the minimum energy, we need to arrange them in a way that minimizes the total potential energy. Since all charges are positive (2e each), the potential energy between any two is positive. So to minimize the total U, we need to arrange the 12 charges such that their mutual potential energies are as small as possible, which would be when they are as far apart as possible.

But arranging 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2m, spaced as far apart as possible from each other. What configuration would that be? I think it's the vertices of a regular icosahedron, which is a polyhedron with 12 vertices. So each of the 12 charges would be at the vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius 2m.

But wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying and just considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, and not considering the mutual interactions. Or perhaps the mutual interactions are not significant, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point 2m from P. But wait, that's impossible because like charges can't be at the same point; they would repel each other infinitely, which isn't feasible. So that can't be the case. So I must consider all mutual interactions.

But the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the mutual interactions are arranged in a way that their potential energies are as small as possible, which would mean arranging them as far apart as possible.

But calculating the exact potential energy for each pair in such a configuration would be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, and not the mutual potential energies between the 12. Let's see what the options are.

Wait, looking at the options, they are all very small numbers except D, which is about 122.330. So D is way larger. The other options are on the order of 1e-26 or 1e-27.

Wait, let me think about the potential energy between two point charges. The formula is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r.

Here, each charge is 2e, so q1 = q2 =
