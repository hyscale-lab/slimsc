Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet is more likely to transit based on the given information. Hmm, transiting probability—I remember that it depends on the size of the planet relative to its star and the orientation of the orbit. 

Wait, the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But I think there's a formula for that. Oh right, the probability P is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, but wait, wait, no. Maybe it's more about the planet's orbital distance and star's size. Oh right, I think the transit probability formula is (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis, but wait, actually, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) squared? Or is it (R_star / a) multiplied by something else?

Wait, let me think again. The probability that a planet transits is given by the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit. So, the probability is (R_star / a) * (something else?) No, maybe it's more precise. The formula I remember is P = (R*/a) where R* is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, isn't there a factor involving the inclination? Oh wait, the transit probability is approximately (R*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (m_p^2)/(M_s^2)))) but since m_p is much smaller than M_s, that term is almost 1. So the main factor is (R*/a).

Wait, but in this case, both planets have the same mass, so that term is the same for both. So the main difference comes from R*/a.

Wait, but in the problem, the two stars have the same radii. So R* is the same for both. So the key is the semi-major axis a. Because a is orbital period dependent, I think. Using Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G(M_s + m_p) * P^2)/(4π²). Since m_p is much smaller than M_s, a is proportional to ( (M_s * P^2) )^(1/3). 

Wait, let me get into that. Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G(M_s + m_p) * P^2) / (4π²). Since m_p is negligible compared to M_s, a^3 ≈ (G M_s P^2) / (4 π²), so a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).

So for each planet, a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3). 

Given that, let's compute the ratio of a for Planet_1 to Planet_2.

Planet_1's M_s is twice that of Planet_2. Let me denote M1 = 2 M2. Also, Planet_1's period is P1 = P2 / 3, since Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So P1 = P2/3.

So a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1^2)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3) = [2 M2 * (P2²)/(9) ]^(1/3) = [ (2/9) * M2 P2² ]^(1/3).

a2 is proportional to (M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3) = [M2 P2²]^(1/3).

So the ratio a1/a2 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3) / [1]^(1/3) ) = (2/9)^(1/3). Let me calculate that. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216. So approximately 0.6.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait cube of 0.6 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So a2 is larger than a1.

Wait, but wait, because a1 is the semi-major axis for Planet_1, and a2 for Planet_2. So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

But the transit probability is (R*/a), and since R* is same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So P_prob1 = R*/a1.

P_prob2 = R*/a2.

So the ratio P_prob1 / P_prob2 = (a2) / (a1) ) = (a2)/(0.6 a2) ) = 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.666.

Which is approximately 1.65 times higher for Planet_1's probability.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the transit probability is P = (R*/a) * ( (R*/a) ) / ( (something else) )? Or is it (R*/a) multiplied by 2?

Wait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the transit probability formula. 

The probability of a planet transiting is approximately (R*/a) * ( (R*/a) )? Or is it (R*/a) multiplied by something else. Wait, I think the actual formula for the probability is (R*/a)^2 * (something else). Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the area of the star's disk is π (R*)², and the area that the planet can block (the cross-section) is the same, but the probability depends on the alignment.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to think geometrically. The probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits is given by (R*/a)^2 divided by the solid angle, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R*/R_p) * ( (R* + R_p)/a ) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (m_p^2)/(M_s^2)) )) )

But since R_p is much smaller than R*, and m_p << M_s, this approximates to P ≈ (R* / a) * (something else). Or perhaps it's just (R*/a) times something.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the probability is the area where the planet's path would cross the star's disk divided by the area of the celestial sphere in that direction. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R*/a)^2 multiplied by (something). Wait, I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, I found a source in my notes (if I were taking a class) that the probability of a transit is P = (R*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (m_p^2)/(M_s^2)) )) ), but since m_p << M_s, that simplifies to P ≈ R*/(a) * 1, so P ≈ R*/a.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another source might say it's (R*/a) * (2 R*/a) / (something). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think of the transit probability as the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis—so P = R*/a. Because the planet must pass in front of the star, which depends on how large the star is relative to the planet's orbital distance.

If that's the case, then since R* is the same for both stars, the probability is inversely proportional to a. So the planet with a smaller a has a higher transit probability.

So earlier, we found that a1 is about 0.6 a2, so a2 is larger. So for Planet_1, a is smaller, so R*/a is larger. So P1 = R*/a1 = R* / (0.6 a2) = (R*/a2) * (1/0.6) ≈ 1.666 times (R*/a2) which is P2.

So P1 is about 1.666 times P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That's close to 1.666.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, as it's more likely to transit.

So the correct answer is C or D? Let me check the options.

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to 2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to 1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

Hmm, according to my calculation, Planet_1 has about 1.66 times higher probability. So option C is the correct one.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_* \)), the key factor is the semi-major axis \( a \).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_s P^2 \), where \( M_s \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet, we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2. Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)), and Planet_1's orbital period is one-third of Planet_2's (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)).

For Planet_1:
\[
a_1 \propto (M_1 P_1^2)^{1/3} = \left(2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}M_2P_2^2\right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2 \propto (M_2 P_2^2)^{1/3}.
\]

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}}{1} \approx \frac{0.6}{1} \approx 0.6.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{R_* / a_1}{R_* / a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]

This indicates that Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

From the options provided:
- **A** and **B** suggest Planet_2 is preferred, which is incorrect.
- **C** states Planet_1 is preferred with a ~1.65 times higher probability, which matches the calculation.
- **D** states Planet_1 is preferred with a ~2.7 times higher probability, which is too high.

The correct answer is **C**.
