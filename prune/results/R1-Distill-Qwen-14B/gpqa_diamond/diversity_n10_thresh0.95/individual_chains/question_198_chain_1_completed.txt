Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, stability constants, right. So the stability constant, β, is a measure of how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex tends to form. Each β corresponds to a different complex. Wait, I think the complexes here are Co(SCN)n^2-n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands. So β1 would be for the monodentate complex, β2 for the bidentate, and so on? Or maybe each β corresponds to each step in the formation. Wait, no, I think βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So for each n, you have a different β.

Wait, wait. Cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate. The possible complexes are Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4, I think. Wait, but the βs given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but wait, the problem states that the stability constants are for the complex, so each β corresponds to the complex with n thiocyanate ions. So the first complex has one SCN, the second has two, etc.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. For the overall complex, the stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + n SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^2- (or something like that). So each βn represents the accumulation of the steps up to that point. No, wait, wait. No, I think each βn is the equilibrium constant for the nth step. Wait, no, the stability constant β for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So, Co^2+ + SCN- ⇌ CoSCN^+ (β1=9), then CoSCN^+ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)2 (β2=40), and so on. Or wait, maybe each β is the overall constant for the complex. No, that can't be right because the β values vary. So perhaps the βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because for each step, the β would be the step-wise constant. Hmm, but for some cases, like when you have a step-wise formation, the overall β would be the product of the step-wise constants. For example, the overall β for the complex with n ligands would be the product of β1, β2, ..., βn. But in this problem, the β are given as β1=9, β2=40, etc., but I don't know if those are step-wise or overall. Wait, the question says 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16'. So each β is the stability constant for the corresponding complex. So β1 is the constant for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2^+ (if it's + charge), etc. Or perhaps each β is the overall formation constant for the complex. So each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex.

Wait, maybe I should think about each β as the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So, for Co(SCN)^+ (n=1), β1=9, for Co(SCN)_2 (n=2), β2=40, for Co(SCN)_3 (n=3), β3=63, and for Co(SCN)_4 (n=4), β4=16. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the charge might be different. For Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Wait, let me think about the possible complexes.

Co^2+ can form complexes with SCN^- as ligands. Each SCN can act as a monodentate ligand. So the possible complexes would be:

- Co(SCN)^(2+ - 1) = Co(SCN)^+ (n=1). Because Co^2+ plus one SCN^- (charge -1) would make Co(SCN)^+ (charge +1).

Wait, no: Co^2+ plus n SCN^- would have a charge of 2+ - n*(1-) = 2+ - n.

Wait, so for n=1: Co(SCN) → charge is 2+ - 1*(-1) = 2+ - (-1)? Wait, no, wait. Each SCN^- has a charge of -1. So the complex's charge would be Co^2+ plus n times (-1) from each SCN. So 2+ - n*(-1) → no, wait, no, each SCN is -1, so n SCN would contribute -n. So Co^2+ (charge +2) plus n SCN^- (each -1) → total charge is 2+ - n*(1) = 2+ -n.

Wait, that's not correct because each SCN is -1, so n of them would be -n, so total charge is 2+ + (-n) = 2 - n.

Wait, for example:

- Co(SCN) → n=1 → charge is 2 - 1 = +1 → Co(SCN)^+.

- Co(SCN)_2 → n=2 → charge 2 - 2 = 0 → Co(SCN)_2^0.

- Co(SCN)_3 → 2-3= -1 → Co(SCN)_3^-.

Wait, but I'm not sure what the actual charges are, but perhaps that's not crucial for the problem.

The problem is about finding the concentration of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would have two SCN ligands, so that's the n=2 case, so Co(SCN)_2.

Wait, no, wait, dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral. So the β for this complex is β2=40.

Wait, but wait the question says 'blue dithiocyanato'—maybe that refers to a specific complex. Some cobalt complexes are blue, like Co(SCN)_4^2- is blue, but I'm not certain. Wait, the problem says 'dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes'—maybe it refers to the complex with two SCN- ligands. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and 'dithiocyanato' implies four SCN-? Because in some contexts, like potassium hexacyanoferrate(II), the structure has six ligands, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the given β values, assuming that each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

So the possible complexes are:

- Co^2+ → [Co(H2O)6]^2+ or other aqua complexes, but I think the problem is considering only the thiocyanato complexes, so perhaps the free Co^2+ is negligible compared to the complexes?

Wait, the problem is to calculate the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So perhaps the question is about the Co(SCN)_2 complex, which is neutral. So we need to find the fraction of this complex in the solution.

But wait, the question says 'the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes', so maybe the blue one is a different complex, perhaps the tetra-thiocyanato complex, which I've heard is blue. But I'm not certain. Well, perhaps the question refers to the complex with four SCN- ligands, which is called the hexaaqua complex or something else. Hmm, but maybe the blue color comes from a different complex, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the colors, but maybe I should proceed by calculating the fractions based on the given β values.

But first, let's get back to the problem: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but perhaps I should think of these βs as the step-wise formation constants. So β1 is the formation constant for the first ligand, β2 is for the second, etc. So for each step, the stability increases.

Wait, no, but that approach would require the overall β for a complex with n ligands to be the product of the step-wise βs. So for example, the overall β for the complex with two ligands would be β1 * β2. But in this problem, each βn is provided, and perhaps those are the overall constants, not the step-wise.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about this. Let me think: the stability constant (formation constant) βn for the complex with n ligands is given. So for each n, the βn is the formation constant for that specific complex.

So, for the first complex, CoSCN^+, the formation constant is β1 = 9.

The second complex, Co(SCN)_2, has a formation constant β2 = 40.

Wait, but if each βn is the overall constant for that n, then the concentrations of each complex can be calculated using their respective βn and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

But wait, if each βn is the overall constant, then the fraction of each complex would be determined by the relative βn values.

But perhaps it's easier to model this using the formation of each complex step by step, considering that each subsequent βn is the step-wise constant. Let me think again.

Wait, if the step-wise constants are β1, β2, β3, β4, then the overall β for the complex with n ligands would be the product of β1 to βn. So for n=1, β1=9, for n=2, β2=40, so overall β is 9*40=360. Similarly, for n=3, β3=63, so overall β is 9*40*63 = 22680. For n=4, β4=16, so overall β is 9*40*63*16 = 362880.

But wait, the problem says the given βs are the stability constants of the complexes, which suggests that each βn is the overall constant for that complex. So for example, β1=9 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2=40 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

If that's the case, then each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of these βn. So perhaps I can model the distribution of the species using the given βn and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Wait, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species. So:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-]

But wait, wait, perhaps the complexes have different charges. Let me think: Co^2+ plus n SCN^- would have a charge of 2+ - n*(1-) = 2+ - (-n) → wait, no. Because each SCN^- is -1, so n SCN- would contribute -n. So the charge of the complex is 2+ - n*(-1)? No, no. Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. The formula for the complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+ - n*1), because each SCN contributes -1. So:

n=1: [CoSCN]^+ → charge is 2+ - 1 = 1+.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2] → charge 2+ - 2 = 0.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → charge 2+ -3 = -1.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → charge 2+ -4 = -2.

Wait, but how does that affect the formation constants? Well, perhaps each complex's formation constant is given as βn, and each complex is in equilibrium with the previous one.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the method of successive approximations or the formation of each complex step by step.

Alternatively, since we have multiple complexes, perhaps we can use the concept of log β ratios to determine the dominant species.

But given that there are four possible complexes, I think I should set up the equations for each complex's concentration in terms of the free [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

The general approach would be:

For each complex, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] * (SCN^-)^n

But wait, but each formation step may have its own β, so perhaps the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the step-wise βs. Or, if the given βs are the overall βs for each complex, then [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] * (SCN^-)^n.

Wait, but if that's the case, then each complex's concentration is given by that equation, and the total Co is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] plus [Co^2+].

But in reality, the complexes might form in a step-wise manner, so the formation of each complex depends on the previous one. For example, [Co(SCN)_2] is formed by the reaction of CoSCN^+ with another SCN^-.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model each step:

Let me define the formation step-wise:

1. Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+ ; β1 = 9.

2. CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2 ; β2 = 40.

3. Co(SCN)_2 + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_3^- ; β3 = 63.

4. Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_4^2- ; β4 = 16.

In this case, the overall formation constants for each complex would be:

β1 = 9 → [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9.

β2 = 40 → [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-]) = 40.

β3 = 63 → [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-]) =63.

β4 =16 → [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/([Co(SCN)_3^-][SCN^-]) =16.

If I proceed this way, I can express each complex's concentration in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

But let me see. Let's denote the concentrations as follows:

Let [Co^2+] = x.

Then:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = 9 x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [CoSCN^+] * [SCN^-] = 40 * (0.9 x) * 0.1 = 40 * 0.09 x = 3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2] * [SCN^-] =63 * (3.6 x) * 0.1 =63 * 0.36 x =22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3^-] * [SCN^-] =16 * (22.68 x) * 0.1 =16 * 2.268 x =36.288 x.

Wait, but wait, this approach may not be correct because each step's formation depends on the previous concentration. So each step multiplies the previous concentration by βn and [SCN^-].

But the problem is that the total concentration of Co is x (from [Co^2+]) plus all the other complexes.

Wait, the total Co concentration is given as 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all Co species.

So:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x.

Adding these up: x (1 +0.9 +3.6 + 22.68 +36.288) = x * (64.868) )= 6.4868e1 x.

Wait, but wait, x is [Co^2+], and the total Co is 1e-2 M, so 64.868 x = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2)/64.868 ≈ 1.54e-4 M.

Wait, but let's compute the sum:

1 (from x) + 0.9 (from [CoSCN^+}) = 1.9

Plus 3.6 → 5.5

Plus 22.68 → 28.18

Plus 36.288 → 64.468.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; 5.5 +22.68=28.18; 28.18 +36.288=64.468. So total is 64.468 x =1e-2 → x=1e-2/64.468≈ 1.551e-4 M.

So [Co^2+] = x≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Wait, but then the [CoSCN^+] is 0.9x ≈1.396e-4.

[Co(SCN)_2] is 3.6x ≈5.583e-4.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] is 22.68 x ≈3.519e-3.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] is 36.288 x ≈5.62e-3.

Wait, but wait, adding all these up:

x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = (1 +0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288)x =64.468x = 1e-2 → x= 1e-2 /64.468 ≈0.0001551 M.

But wait, I thought the question was about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I'm assuming is [Co(SCN)_2], the neutral one. So the concentration of that would be 3.6 x ≈3.6 * 0.0001551 ≈5.5836e-4 M.

The total concentration of all Co species is 1e-2 M, so the fraction of Co in [Co(SCN)_2] is (5.5836e-4) / (1e-2) = 0.055836, or about 5.58%.

But that's not matching any of the options, which are all way higher than 5%.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the βs given are the overall βn values, not the step-wise. So, for example, β1=9 is the overall β for [CoSCN]^+, β2=40 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

In that case, the concentrations would be calculated as:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So [CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^1 =9 x (0.1) =0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2]= β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 =40 x (0.1)^2=40 x 0.01=0.4 x.

[Co(SCN)_3^-]= β3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3=63 x (0.1)^3=63 x 0.001=0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-]= β4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4=16 x (0.1)^4=16 x 0.0001=0.0016 x.

So the total Co concentration is:

[Co^2+] + 0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = x (1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016 ) =x (2.3646) =1e-2 → x=1e-2/2.3646≈4.225e-3 M.

So [Co^2+] ≈4.225e-3 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN^+] =0.9 x ≈0.9 *4.225e-3 ≈3.8025e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]=0.4 x≈0.4 *4.225e-3≈1.69e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_3^-]=0.063 x≈0.063 *4.225e-3≈2.662e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-]=0.0016 x≈6.76e-6 M.

Now, the total Co is x + 0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = (1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016) x = 2.3646x =1e-2 → x=4.225e-3.

Now, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], is (1.69e-3 / 1e-2)*100% = (0.169) *100% =16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So the answer should be D.

But wait, wait a second. The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I assumed [Co(SCN)_2] is the dithiocyanato complex. But if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, then I would have to calculate its percentage.

Wait, but according to the given β values, [Co(SCN)_4] has β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. So the [Co(SCN)_3^-] would be higher than [Co(SCN)_4^2-].

Wait, but in the calculation above, using the overall βn approach, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 1.69e-3 M, which is 16.9% of the total. So option D.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again about the stability constants.

Another approach is to consider that the stability constants determine the distribution of the complexes. The higher the β, the more the complex tends to form. So for each complex, the fraction is proportional to βn multiplied by [SCN^-]^n, all divided by the sum of all such terms plus 1 (for [Co^2+]).

Wait, perhaps using the formula:

The fraction of each complex is (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, but in the overall approach, the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+] + sum of all [Co(SCN)_k] ).

But maybe a better way is to model the fraction of each species as (βn [SCN^-]^n) divided by the sum of (βk [SCN^-]^k) for k=0 to 4, where β0 is 1 (for [Co^2+]).

So, let's compute each term:

β0 =1 → term is 1*(0.1)^0 =1.

β1=9 →9*(0.1)^1=0.9.

β2=40 →40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

β3=63 →63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

β4=16 →16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all these terms: 1 +0.9=1.9 → +0.4=2.3 → +0.063=2.363 → +0.0016=2.3646.

So the sum is 2.3646.

The fraction of each species is (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / sum.

So for n=2 (dithiocyanato), fraction is 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, or 16.9%. Which is option D.

But wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So perhaps [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the blue one, which would correspond to n=4. But in that case, the fraction would be 0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676, which is 0.0676%, which isn't any of the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, but according to the given β values, that's the least likely to form because β4=16 is lower than β3=63. So the fraction would be low.

But according to the calculation where the βn are the overall constants, the [Co(SCN)_2] has a fraction of 16.9%, which is option D. So that must be the correct answer.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \), along with the concentrations \([ \text{Co}^{2+} ]_{\text{total}} = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}\) and \([ \text{SCN}^- ] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\).

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Stability Constants**: Each \(\beta_n\) represents the overall stability constant for the complex \(\text{Co(SCN)_n}\). The concentration of each complex is proportional to \(\beta_n \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n\).

2. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each cobalt species is given by:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
   \]
   where \(\beta_0 = 1\) corresponds to the free \(\text{Co}^{2+}\) ion.

3. **Total Denominator**: The denominator is the sum of contributions from all species:
   \[
   \sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^k = \beta_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^0 + \beta_1 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^1 + \beta_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]

### Calculations:
1. **Compute Contributions**:
   - For \(\text{Co}^{2+}\): \( \beta_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
   - For \(\text{CoSCN}^+\): \( \beta_1 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
   - For \(\text{Co(SCN)_2}\): \( \beta_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
   - For \(\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-\): \( \beta_3 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
   - For \(\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}\): \( \beta_4 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

2. **Sum of Contributions**:
   \[
   \sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^k = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

3. **Fraction of \(\text{Co(SCN)_2}\)**:
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex \(\text{Co(SCN)_2}\) is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^k} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

4. **Percentage of \(\text{Co(SCN)_2}\)**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = f_2 \cdot 100 = 0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (\(\text{Co(SCN)_2}\)) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
