Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax (in arcseconds) is 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, right, so distance d = 1/plx.

But I'm a bit confused about how the number of stars relates to distance. Let's think about this. If the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5, then substituting plx in terms of d would help, maybe.

Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, that would mean as distance increases, the number of stars increases by d to the fifth power. But wait, that doesn't sound right—intuitively, I thought that more distant stars are fewer in number because they're spread out more. But maybe this specific case is different.

Wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. So perhaps it's about the number density, like the number per unit volume? Or maybe the number per unit distance. Hmm, the question says per unit range of distance r, so perhaps we're talking about the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r, or something like that.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The number of stars as a function of distance. Let's model it.

If N is proportional to d^5, but wait, that would mean that as d increases, N increases, which seems counterintuitive. Because as you go further away, there might be fewer stars in a given volume. But maybe the way the problem is set up, the number of stars is increasing with distance.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the number of stars and the number per unit volume. Let me think about it.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the number of stars in a region of the sky, which is a function of distance. So for each distance, how many stars are there. So perhaps the number of stars at a certain distance is proportional to d^5.

But that's a bit strange because higher distances would have more stars. But maybe in this case, the distribution is such that more stars are present at larger distances. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the number varies.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential number. Like, how many stars are there per unit distance. So, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr. That would be dN = N(r) dr. If N(r) is proportional to r^5, then dN would be proportional to r^5 dr. But the question is about the change with distance, so perhaps the number per unit range is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^5. So the answer would be option B, which is r^5.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me recap.

Given: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d.

So N ∝ (d)^5 → N = k d^5, where k is a constant.

So for each distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So if you move to a distance d, the number of stars increases as d^5.

Wait, but that would imply that as you go further away, you find more stars in that region, which seems odd because typically, the density decreases with distance. But maybe in this specific case, it's the opposite.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number per unit volume. Let's see.

The number density of stars (n) is usually number per unit volume, so n ∝ 1/(d^2), because the volume increases with d^3, and if the number increases with d^5, then n ∝ d^5/(d^3) )= d^2. But that's a different matter.

But the question here is about the number in the region, not the number density. So if N is proportional to d^5, then per unit distance, the number of stars increases as d^5.

Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, per unit range of distance. So perhaps the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr is proportional to r^5. So dN/dr = 5 r^4. But then the number per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4. But that's not matching any options. Wait the options are about how the number changes with distance. So, perhaps the number of stars in a given distance range is proportional to r^5.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it in terms of the relationship between parallax and distance.

Parallax plx = 1/d (if d is in parsecs). So d = 1/plx.

So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → N ∝ (d)^5.

So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases with d^5.

Wait, but wait, the options are about the change with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases as d^5. So per unit distance, the change would be d^5. So the answer would be option B, which is ~ r^5.

Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking of the differential. The number of stars in an infinitesimal distance interval dr would be dN = N dr. Since N = k d^5, then dN = k d^5 dr. So the number per unit distance is proportional to d^5. So the number increases with distance as r^5.

So the correct answer would be option B, ~ r^5.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) in parsecs, such that \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). Substituting this relationship into the given proportionality, \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \) becomes \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance as \( d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). If \( N \propto d^5 \), then the number of stars per unit distance (e.g., in a thin shell of radius \( r \) and thickness \( dr \)) is proportional to \( r^5 \). Therefore, the number of stars in the region of the sky changes with distance as \( r^5 \).

Answer: B
