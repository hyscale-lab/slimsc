Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex at a concentration of 0.02 M. The pH is ideal, which I think means that the EDTA is in its proper form for complexing with calcium. The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius, and the stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. 

Hmm, I remember that the stability constant (K) for a complex ion like Ca-EDTA indicates how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is more stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. But in this case, I'm supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+].

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the total concentration of Ca and EDTA in the solution is based on the dissociation of this complex. But because K is so large, the dissociation should be minimal. So the amount of free Ca²+ ions should be really small.

The formula for the stability constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but sometimes EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Since the pH is ideal, I guess the problem assumes that all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So I don't have to worry about that here.

So, the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let's call this complex [CaY]. So, [CaY] = 0.02 M. Because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the initial assumption is that [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both approximately equal to x, since the stoichiometry is 1:1. But wait, the complex is already formed, so perhaps the dissociation is so small that [Ca²+] is much less than 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA. So, in pure solution, without considering dissociation, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, each molecule gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

But with such a high K (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ will be very small. Let's model this.

Assume that the dissociation is x. So, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaY] = 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate [CaY] ≈ 0.02.

So, K ≈ [CaY]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) => 5e10 ≈ (0.02)/(x^2)

So, solving for x²: x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3 /5e10 = 4e-13.

Wait, let me compute that again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So, x squared is 4e-13, which means x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, that would make x approximately 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is about 6.3e-7 M. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That looks like the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake.

Wait, the calculation: K=5e10 = [CaY]/( [Ca²+][EDTA] )

Assuming [CaY] = 0.02, and [Ca²+] = [EDTA] = x.

So, 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2)

So x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 1e-7, so 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So yes, [Ca²+] is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the setup. The Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, the total concentration is 0.02 M, but how does that relate to the dissociation? Because each CaY dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, so the total concentration of Ca²+ plus the complex is 0.02?

Wait no, the complex is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, it produces x of each ion. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M CaY. At equilibrium, [CaY] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA] = x. But since K is so large, x is very small compared to 0.02, so [CaY] ≈ 0.02.

So, I think the initial approach is correct. So the answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The stability constant is given by:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Since the dissociation is minimal (due to the large \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\)), the concentration of the undissociated complex \([\text{CaY}]\) remains approximately 0.02 M. Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \approx \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
