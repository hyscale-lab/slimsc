Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, known as SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators in SMEFT must obey the same symmetries as the Standard Model itself.

Wait, what are the fundamental symmetries of the Standard Model? I think they're Lorentz symmetry, gauge symmetry (like SU(2) and SU(3)), and also the CPT symmetry because that's a big one in quantum field theory. But wait, Poincare is about spacetime symmetries (like translations and Lorentz), so Poincare includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. But if the operators must respect Poincare, then Lorentz is automatically included because it's part of Poincare. But wait, is that how the SMEFT works?

Wait, SMEFT is written in a way that respects the Standard Model's symmetries. The Standard Model includes Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincare. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. But wait, does SMEFT respect Poincare? Well, Poincare includes translations. The SMEFT is an effective theory, and when you write down effective operators, they are written in the form of local operators, so they should respect Poincare symmetry. Because if they didn't, you'd have non-local terms or something, which isn't how SMEFT is constructed.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Poincare includes both translations and Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect both. So if all SMEFT operators respect Poincare, then Lorentz is automatically a subset. But is that the case?

I think the SMEFT operators are constructed to be Lorentz invariant. So they must respect Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare? Since the operators are local, and the theory is constructed in a way that maintains Poincare, so yes, Poincare symmetry is also respected.

Wait, but I seem to remember that the SMEFT respects all the symmetries of the Standard Model, including Lorentz and gauge symmetries. But Poincare is a bigger symmetry.

Wait, the question is which of these symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the options are 1,2,3,4. Let me go through each.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Do all SMEFT operators respect this? Yes, because they are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. So yes.

2. Poincare symmetry: This includes translations and Lorentz. Since the SMEFT includes terms that are local, and local terms respect Poincare. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare.

Wait but wait, do the SMEFT operators respect Poincare? Because if an operator is a local operator, like (Dμ ϕ)† D^μ ϕ, that's Poincare invariant. So yes. So option 2 is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on whether Poincare is a separate requirement or if it's automatically satisfied because operators are local.

Wait, let's think. Poincare symmetry includes translations (momentum conservation), Lorentz transformations, etc. If an operator is constructed in a way that is invariant under both, then yes. But SMEFT operators are written as local operators, so they should respect Poincare.

So both 1 and 2 are correct. What about 3 and 4?

3. CP symmetry: The Standard Model has CP symmetry (except for the CKM phase, which is a source of CP violation). Wait, no, the Standard Model doesn't have exact CP symmetry. So SMEFT, which includes higher-dimension operators, can violate CP. But are all operators in SMEFT required to respect CP? I don't think so. Because operators can have terms that break CP. For example, operators like (H† H)^2 are CP-even, but others might not be. So 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

4. CPT symmetry: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. Because if they didn't, the theory would not be consistent. So yes, CPT is a must.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect?

1. Lorentz: yes.

2. Poincare: yes.

3. CP: no.

4. CPT: yes.

Wait, but wait: Poincare is a subset that includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz (option 1). So which of the options include both 1 and 2? Let's look at the options.

Options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, options 1, 2, and 4 are the ones that must be respected. So the correct answer would include 1, 2, and 4. But looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

But wait, am I confident that SMEFT operators must respect Poincare? I'm a bit unsure. Because I've heard that SMEFT respects Lorentz, but I'm not so certain about Poincare.

Wait, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because all operators are Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. Poincare includes translations. But, well, if the operators are written as local terms, then yes, they respect Poincare. For example, each term in the Lagrangian is a local operator, so when you integrate over spacetime, the total action is Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but the question is about each operator, not the entire action. Hmm. So each individual operator in the Lagrangian needs to be a Poincare scalar? Well, the Lagrangian is a scalar density, so each term is a scalar under Poincare. Because the Lagrangian is constructed to have Poincare symmetry. Therefore, each operator in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare. So yes, each operator must respect Poincare.

So 1 and 2 are correct. So the correct answer would be option C, which includes 1,2,4. But wait, option C is 1,2,4. But wait, I thought earlier that 3 (CP) is not necessarily required. So 4 (CPT) is a must.

Wait, but the question states which must be respected by all operators. So all operators must respect CPT? Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. I think in the SMEFT, which is an effective theory, the CPT symmetry must be preserved. Because a violation of CPT would imply a non-unitary theory, which is not acceptable. So yes, all operators must respect CPT.

So then, the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Let me check the options again.

Option C: 1,2,4.

So answer C.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, does each operator in SMEFT have to respect Poincare? Because the operator itself is a local scalar, yes. So, yes, each operator must be invariant under Poincare. So 1 and 2 must be respected.

So, the correct options are 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries of the Standard Model and how they extend to SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for consistency with the Standard Model.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT operators are local and constructed to respect spacetime symmetries, they must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincaré symmetry, and both are satisfied.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not strictly respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM sector. SMEFT operators can also violate CP, so CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, ensuring unitarity and consistency. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1, 2, 4.

Answer: C
