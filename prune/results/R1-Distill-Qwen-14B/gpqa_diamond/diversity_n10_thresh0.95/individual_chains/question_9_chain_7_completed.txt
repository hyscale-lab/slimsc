Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me think through this.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. I recall that C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a 120-degree rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have threefold rotational symmetry and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Looking at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
Option C: triisopropyl borate
Option D: quinuclidine

I think triphenyleno... something. Wait, triphenylene is a molecule I've heard about. It's a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings connected in a certain way. Maybe that structure has some symmetry. But I'm not sure about the substituents and their positions.

Option B is benzo attached in a similar way. Benzo has lower symmetry than triphenylene, perhaps? If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe it has C3h.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Structure-wise, triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO. The boron is in the center, bonded to three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are symmetric. So the molecule has three identical groups attached to B. Wait, symmetry-wise, that's C3. But wait, C3h would require a mirror plane. If the molecule is trigonal and has a mirror plane, then yes. But I'm not sure if triisopropyl borate has a mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's just C3v symmetry, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, wait—triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, right? All the isopropyl groups are the same, so it has a threefold axis (C3), and since it's planar, there are mirror planes. Wait, but in a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are each perpendicular to a C2 axis. So maybe it has C3h symmetry because the overall point group is D3h or C3v? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bridge structure. I remember it has an octahedral-like structure but with nitrogen. The structure is kinda like a bridge with three carbons on each side. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a seven-membered ring with three bridges. Wait, it's a bicyclo structure, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative. So the molecule is symmetric. Quinuclidine has a threefold rotation axis because of its structure. Let me think: in quinuclidine, if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. And does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Maybe. Wait, the molecule is symmetric with respect to a plane that bisects the molecule. So perhaps it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, triisopropyl borate: considering the structure, each isopropyl group is the same and arranged symmetrically around the boron. So the molecule has a threefold rotation axis (C3), and I think it also has a mirror plane. So maybe it has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, triphenyleno... I'm not as familiar with that structure. Let's think: triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a way that forms a triphenylene structure, which is symmetrical. If the substituents are placed in a symmetric way, maybe the molecule has C3h symmetry.

Wait, the question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. So I need to figure out each option's point group.

Option A: triphenyleno… I think it's a derivative of triphenylene, which is a symmetric molecule. Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. So any derivative that preserves that symmetry would have C3h or another higher symmetry. But the substituents here are on the trifuran rings. Hmm, not sure.

Option B: benzo... I'm not as confident. Maybe it's a derivative of a molecule with lower symmetry.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. If it's trigonal planar, then it's D3h, which includes C3h. So that would give it C3h symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine. I think quinuclidine has a threefold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Or maybe it has a horizontal mirror plane. Quinuclidine's structure is symmetric across a plane perpendicular to the threefold axis. So rotation by 120 degrees, and a mirror plane would make it C3h.

Wait, but perhaps quinuclidine has a higher symmetry. Wait, quinuclidine is a seven-membered bicyclic amine. Its structure is such that it has three equivalent substituents (like the three CH2 groups). So perhaps it has a threefold rotation axis and a mirror plane, giving C3h.

Alternatively, triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar, so it has a threefold rotation axis, and since it's planar, it has mirror planes. So the point group is D3h, which includes C3h as a subgroup. So triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but in the options, option C is triisopropyl borate. So that's a possible answer.

Alternatively, let me think about each molecule's point group:

Triisopropyl borate: the molecule is planar, with three identical substituents around B. So the point group is D3h, which means it has C3h symmetry (since C3h is a subgroup of D3h). So yes, it has C3h.

Quinuclidine: structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. The molecule has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane perpendicular to it. So the point group is C3h. So yes, quinuclidine also has C3h.

Wait, so both option C and D might have C3h symmetry. That can't be. So which one is correct?

Wait, actually, let me get the point groups right. Triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar. The point group is D3h. D3h has more symmetry elements than C3h. So the molecule would have C3h symmetry, but also other elements.

Quinuclidine: the structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative. It has a threefold axis, and a mirror plane. So perhaps its point group is C3h.

Wait, but does quinuclidine have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me visualize the structure. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure, with a nitrogen in the bridge. The molecule is symmetric with respect to a plane that passes through the nitrogen and the center of the opposite bridge. So a mirror plane would exist. So yes, it has a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis (the threefold axis), which makes it C3h.

So both options C and D have C3h symmetry? That can't be. The question says which one has C3h symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule with threefold symmetry, but does it have a mirror plane? Let me think. The molecule is symmetric across three planes, each containing the B atom and a pair of isopropyl groups. So, for each plane, it's a mirror plane. So it's D3h symmetry. D3h includes C3h, but the point group is not C3h itself.

Wait, the point group C3h is a subgroup of D3h. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it has C3h symmetry as well. So triisopropyl borate does have C3h symmetry.

Similarly, quinuclidine has C3h. So how can both be correct?

Wait, perhaps I got the point groups wrong. Let me think again.

In option D, quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with a bridge. The molecule has a threefold axis, and a mirror plane, but what's the point group?

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivatives, like quinuclidine, have a point group of C3h. Because the molecule has a threefold axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (sigma h). So yes, quinuclidine has C3h symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry. So it does have C3h symmetry as well.

So both options C and D have C3h symmetry. But the question asks which has C3h symmetry. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the point group being exactly C3h, not a subset. So D3h includes C3h, but the point group is D3h. So maybe the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, but the options are given, and the question is to choose which one has C3h symmetry. Since both C and D have C3h symmetry, but perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is quinuclidine. Let me think again.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule with threefold symmetry, and yes, has a mirror plane. So it's D3h, which includes C3h.

Quinuclidine, perhaps, is C3h symmetry because it's not planar. Wait, no, it's not planar—bicyclic structures are not planar. So D3h is a planar point group. So quinuclidine can't have D3h.

Wait, D3h requires a plane of symmetry. Quinuclidine has a mirror plane, but it's not planar. So its point group is C3h, not D3h.

Triisopropyl borate is planar (all substituents are in the same plane), so it's D3h, which includes C3h.

So both have C3h symmetry, but the question is which of the options is correct. But the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]
B) benzo[...]
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

The question is which has C3h symmetry. So if both C and D have C3h, but the options are presented as A, B, C, D, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe only one of them actually has C3h. Let me double-check.

Another approach: perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a mirror plane. Wait, if the molecule is trigonal planar, mirror planes exist. For example, each mirror plane passes through the B atom and bisects one isopropyl group. So yes, there are three mirror planes. So the point group is D3h, which includes C3h.

So triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine (option D) has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, so point group C3h.

So both C and D have C3h symmetry. But since the question is multiple-choice, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the highest symmetry being C3h. So maybe triisopropyl borate has higher symmetry than C3h, but in this case, it's D3h.

Wait, but the question asks which has C3h symmetry. So both would have it, but perhaps only one is correct in the options.

Wait, looking at the options, the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck, but let me think about each structure again.

- Triisopropyl borate: The molecule is trigonal planar, like BF3, but with isopropyl groups. So the point group is D3h, which includes C3h.

- Quinuclidine: It's a bicyclic molecule with a threefold rotation axis and a mirror plane. So point group is C3h.

So, both C and D have C3h symmetry. But the question is to choose one. Hmm. Maybe I'm wrong about quinuclidine's point group.

Wait, perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a mirror plane. Let me think about the structure. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure with three substituents. Let me imagine: the molecule has a bridge over two carbons, and the other bridge is between two other positions. Wait, perhaps the mirror plane is perpendicular to the threefold axis, which would split the molecule into two mirror images.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine's point group is actually C3. Because the mirror plane may not be present.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual symmetry operations. Quinuclidine is a seven-membered bicyclic amine. The molecule has a threefold rotation axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the given options. Let me look for the correct answer.

I seem to recall that triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, and quinuclidine has C3h symmetry. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but someone else might think that triisopropyl borate has C3h. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of mirror planes. Triisopropyl borate has three mirror planes (each through B and between two isopropyl groups), so D3h. Quinuclidine has one mirror plane, making its point group C3h.

So, the correct answer is D) quinuclidine.


To determine which molecule has **C3h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C3h symmetry** includes a threefold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Below is the analysis of each option:

---

### **Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule is derived from triphenylene, which is a symmetric structure with three benzene rings. However, the substituents on the trifuran rings may disrupt the symmetry.
- Without explicit details about the substituents and their arrangement, it is unclear if this molecule retains **C3h symmetry**. It is likely to have lower symmetry due to the substituents.

---

### **Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule is based on a benzo-fused trifuran structure. The arrangement of the substituents and fused rings suggests lower symmetry compared to triphenylene derivatives.
- It is unlikely to have **C3h symmetry** due to the asymmetry introduced by the benzo-fused structure.

---

### **Option C: triisopropyl borate**
- Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure with three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. This arrangement gives it a threefold rotational axis (C3).
- Additionally, the molecule has mirror planes (σ) perpendicular to the C3 axis, making it planar and giving it **D3h symmetry**.
- Since **C3h symmetry** is a subgroup of **D3h symmetry**, this molecule does have **C3h symmetry**.

---

### **Option D: quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework. It has a threefold rotational axis (C3) due to the symmetry of the bicyclic structure.
- The molecule also has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that bisects the structure, making its point group **C3h**.
- Therefore, quinuclidine has **C3h symmetry**.

---

### **Conclusion**
Both **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** and **quinuclidine (Option D)** have **C3h symmetry**. However, the question asks for the molecule that **has C3h symmetry**, and **quinuclidine** is explicitly known to have **C3h symmetry** as its defining point group. Triisopropyl borate, while also having **C3h symmetry**, has higher overall symmetry (D3h). Thus, the best answer is **quinuclidine**.

**Answer: D**
