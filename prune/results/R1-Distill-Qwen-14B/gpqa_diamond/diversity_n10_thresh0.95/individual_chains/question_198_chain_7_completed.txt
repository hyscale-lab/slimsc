--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with coordination complexes and stability constants. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We have these stability constants for the complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, wait, what's a dithiocyanato complex? Oh right, I think it's a complex with two thiocyanate ligands. So maybe the [Co(SCN)_2] species? But I'm not entirely sure about the nomenclature here.

Stability constants, right. The stability constant (β) tells us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the complexes with higher β will form more readily.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I'm assuming the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ligands, like [Co(SCN)_2]^something. But wait, what are the possible complexes here? The stability constants are given up to β4, so probably the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, let me think: the charge of the complex would depend on the number of SCN- ions. Each SCN- is -1. So for Co^2+:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ → Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is + (2+) -1 (from Co) +1 (from SCN) → wait, no. Wait, the formula would be [Co(SCN)]^+ because Co^2+ plus one SCN^- (charge -1) gives overall charge +1. So [Co(SCN)]^+ has β1=9.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2] would be neutral. Because Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- (-2) → overall 0. So β2=40.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- would have Co^2+ +3 SCN^- (-3), so overall charge is -1. β3=63.

And [Co(SCN)_4]^2- would have Co^2+ +4 SCN^- (-4), so overall charge is -2. Beta4=16.

So all four complexes are possible. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Since the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, which is mono, the dithiocyanato would be the second one, [Co(SCN)_2].

So the task is to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] in the solution compared to all possible Co species.

To find the fraction, I think we need to calculate the concentrations of all possible complexes and then find the ratio of [Co(SCN)_2] to the total Co concentration.

The total Co concentration is given as 1e-2 M (c(Co) = 1e-2 M). But we also have to account for the distribution among the complexes.

Wait, but also, the solution has a fixed [SCN^-] of 0.1 M. So the concentration of free SCN- is 0.1 M.

I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be determined using the stability constants and the concentration of the ligand. The fraction of each complex can be found using the constants and the ligand concentration.

The general approach is to use the stepwise formation equations. For each complex, the formation depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

The formula for the fraction of each species is based on the product of the stability constants and the appropriate power of the ligand concentration.

Wait, the fraction for each species is given by (β_n * [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, no, the formula for the fraction of the nth complex is (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum over all m of (β1β2...βm) [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the formation of the complexes step by step.

The fraction of each complex, f_n, is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / Σ (for m=0 to 4) [ (β1 β2 ... βm) [SCN^-]^m ]

Wait, no, maybe better to model the species as follows:

The complexes are [Co], [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Each complex is formed by adding SCN^- step by step. So the concentration of each complex can be found using the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The general formula for the concentration of the nth complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β1 β2 ... βn [Co]_free [SCN^-]^n

But since the total Co is the sum of all complexes plus free Co^2+ (but wait, the question says "cobalt containing species", so it includes all complexes, so I don't need to account for free Co^2+ because it's not a cobalt-containing species? Wait, no. The free Co^2+ is a Co species. Oh wait, no. The question says "all cobalt containing species". So the total is the sum of all complexes and the free Co^2+. But wait, in the question, the total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M, which would include all Co species, including the complexes and free Co^2+.

Wait, but the initial statement says "the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M". So that's the sum of [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So the sum of all these is 1e-2 M.

But how do we find the fraction of each species?

I think the fractions are determined by the relative contributions of each complex, which depends on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should model the fractions using the following approach:

The fraction of each complex (f_n) is equal to (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum for m=0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βm) [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, but m here is the number of ligands. So for each complex, the numerator is the product of all β up to n multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but wait, each β is the stepwise stability constant. So β1 is the constant for adding the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc.

So the fraction for the nth complex is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, but wait, I think the denominator is the sum over all possible complexes (including the free ion). So perhaps the denominator is the sum of all terms from m=0 to m=4, where each term is the product of the β's up to m.

Wait, but for the free ion (m=0), the term is 1, because β product is the empty product (which is 1), and [SCN^-]^0 is 1.

So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4.

So each term in the denominator corresponds to the m-th complex's contribution.

So the fraction f_n is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) divided by the denominator.

So, for the [Co(SCN)_2] complex (n=2), the fraction f_2 is (β1 * β2 * [SCN^-]^2 ) / denominator.

Wait, no, wait: for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, it's β1 [SCN^-] in the numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me think again: the denominator is the sum of all the terms for each possible complex. So for each complex, [Co(SCN)_n], the term is β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [SCN^-]^n.

So the denominator is the sum of these terms from n=0 to n=4, where for n=0, it's 1.

So, the denominator D is D = 1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s^2 + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4, where s is [SCN^-].

In this problem, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So let's compute each term:

Compute each term in the denominator:

s = 0.1.

Term for n=0: 1.

n=1: β1 * s = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: β1 * β2 * s^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 9*40 * 0.01 = 9 * 0.4 = 3.6.

n=3: β1 β2 β3 * s^3 =9*40*63 * (0.1)^3.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

9 *40 = 360. 360 *63= 22680.

(0.1)^3=0.001.

So 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=3 term: 22.68.

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 * s^4 =9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute each part: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001 =36.288.

So denominator D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 +36.288.

Let me add them up.

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, the fraction of the second complex (n=2) is:

f2= (β1 β2 s^2 ) / D.

Which is (3.6) /64.468 ≈ 0.0555555556.

Wait, 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.0555555556. So that's approximately 5.555555555%? But wait, that's only 5.55%, but the options are way higher. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait a second. No, wait, because the question says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution."

Wait, but I think I might have confused the denominator. Because the denominator is the sum for D, which is 64.468. But wait, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M.

Wait, but the way the fractions work is that the sum of all fractions (f0 + f1 + f2 + f3 + f4) =1, because they represent the distribution of all Co species. So each f is the fraction of that particular species.

But wait, in the denominator, each term is the contribution of that species, so the total in the denominator is the sum of all species' contributions. So the fraction f2 is (3.6)/64.468 ≈ 0.055555, so about 5.555% for [Co(SCN)_2]. But that's not matching any of the options. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc.

Hmm, so maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking for the amount in the denominator, but perhaps I should scale the fractions with the total concentration.

Wait, let me think again.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all complex concentrations plus the free Co^2+ concentration. But wait, the way the fractions are typically calculated, the sum of all f_i is 1, which represents all Co is in one of the species.

Wait, but in this case, the denominator D is the sum of all the contributions for each complex, and the numerator for each species is the contribution for that species.

So the fraction f2 would be 3.6 /64.468, which is about 5.555%. But that's way lower than any of the options. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the denominator.

Let me recompute each term:

s = 0.1.

n=0 → 1.

n=1 → β1 s =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2 → β1 β2 s² =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 =9 *40 *0.01= 9*0.4=3.6.

n=3 → β1 β2 β3 s^3 =9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 =9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 * 0.001=22.68.

n=4 → β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute that: 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So D=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Adding them up:

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

So the numerator for n=2 is 3.6.

3.6 /64.468 = approx 0.055555556 =5.55555556%.

Hmm, but the options are higher. I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the way the βs are used wrong. Because sometimes, the stability constant is given as the cumulative constant, not the stepwise. Oh wait, in the problem statement, the β values are given as the stability constants for the complexes. Wait, no, the problem says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, wait, the stability constant for a complex is usually the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal and the ligands. So for a complex like [Co(SCN)_n], the stability constant is the product of the stepwise constants up to n.

Wait, no, the way it's given, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc. So the β's are the stepwise constants.

Wait, so for the formation of [Co(SCN)_2], the reaction is:

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2], and β2 is the stability constant for this step.

So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1 * β2.

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, it's β1 * β2 * β3, and so on.

So that part was correct.

Wait, but maybe I should express the denominator correctly. Let me think again.

The denominator is the sum for each possible complex, where each term is the product of the stepwise βs up to that point, multiplied by s^n, where n is the number of ligands.

So for each complex:

[Co] → n=0 → term is 1.

[CoSCN]^+ → n=1 → term is β1 * s.

[Co(SCN)_2] → n=2 → β1 β2 s^2.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- → n=3 → β1 β2 β3 s^3.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- → n=4 → β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4.

Thus, the denominator D = sum of all these terms.

Wait, but in the problem statement, β4=16, but when I computed the term for n=4, I did β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * s^4.

Which would be 9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4.

Wait, 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

362880 * (0.1)^4=36.288.

Yes, that's correct.

So denominator D is 64.468.

So the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is 3.6 /64.468 = approx 5.5555%.

But that's not matching any of the options. Hmm. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the dithiocyanato complexes, which might include more than one species. Like, perhaps [Co(SCN)_2] is the second complex, but maybe there's another dithiocyanato complex with a different charge or structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is a different one. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the color corresponding to which complex. But the question says "blue dithiocyanato", and I think that refers to [Co(SCN)_2], which is the neutral complex.

Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the sum of all complexes with two SCN- ligands. But I don't think so; the βs are given up to n=4, and each n corresponds to a single complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recompute the denominator.

Wait, D=1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me add them step by step.

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Hmm, so the fraction is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05555556. That's about 5.5555%.

But the options are all higher. So I'm probably missing something.

Wait, wait a minute. The initial approach I took considered the fractions based on the product terms, but perhaps the correct approach is to compute the concentrations of each complex and then find the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should model the concentrations as follows:

The concentration of each complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = K_n * [Co]_free * [SCN^-]^n,

where K_n is the overall stability constant for that complex, which is the product of the stepwise βs up to n.

But since the total Co concentration is the sum of all complexes plus the free Co^2+ (but wait, the question says "cobalt containing species", which includes all complexes and the free Co^2+). So the total concentration is:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But since [Co^2+] is free, perhaps that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the solution assumes that the free Co^2+ is negligible, but given the numbers, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the free Co^2+ is negligible compared to the complexes, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to consider that all the Co is distributed into the complexes, which would imply that [Co^2+] is negligible. But given the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, but let's try to model it properly.

Let me denote:

Let [Co^2+] = x.

Each complex [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n * x * s^n,

where K_n is the overall stability constant for that complex, which is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So:

[CoSCN]^+ = K1 x s = β1 x s.

[Co(SCN)_2] = K2 x s² = β1β2 x s².

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = K3 x s³ = β1β2β3 x s^3.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = K4 x s^4 = β1β2β3β4 x s^4.

The total Co concentration is:

x + K1 x s + K2 x s² + K3 x s^3 + K4 x s^4 = c_total = 0.01 M.

So x (1 + K1 s + K2 s² + K3 s^3 + K4 s^4 ) = 0.01.

Hmm, but that seems complicated. Because we'd have to solve for x, which is the free Co^2+ concentration.

But perhaps if we make the approximation that x is much smaller than the other terms, then 1 is negligible compared to the other terms. Let me check.

Given s=0.1 M.

Compute the sum S = 1 + K1 s + K2 s² + K3 s^3 + K4 s^4.

From earlier, S = D =64.468.

So S=64.468.

So, x * 64.468 ≈0.01 → x ≈ 0.01 /64.468 ≈1.55e-4 M.

So x ≈ 0.000155 M.

But that's the free Co^2+ concentration.

So the concentrations of each complex are:

[CoSCN]^+ = K1 x s =9 * 1.55e-4 *0.1 =9 *1.55e-5 =1.395e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] = K2 x s² =9*40 * 1.55e-4 * (0.1)^2.

Wait, K2=β1β2=9*40=360.

So 360 *1.55e-4 *0.01 =360 *1.55e-6 =5.58e-4 M.

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = K3 x s^3 =9*40*63 *1.55e-4 *0.001.

Wait, K3=9*40*63=22680.

So 22680 *1.55e-4 *0.001 =22680 *1.55e-7 = approx 3.519e-3 M.

And [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = K4 x s^4 =9*40*63*16 *1.55e-4 *0.0001.

K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So 362880 *1.55e-4 * 0.0001 =362880 * 1.55e-8 = approx 5.62e-3 M.

Now, let's compute all these.

Wait, let me compute each term precisely:

[CoSCN]^+ =9 * x * 0.1 → x=1.55e-4 → 9 * 1.55e-4 *0.1 =9 *1.55e-5 =1.395e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] =360 * x *0.01 →360 *1.55e-4 *0.01 =360 *1.55e-6 =5.58e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =22680 * x *0.001 →22680 *1.55e-4 *0.001 =22680 *1.55e-7 =approx 22680 *1.55e-7 → let's compute 22680 *1.55= 22680 *1.55 = 35,194 → 35,194e-7 = 3.5194e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- =362880 *x * 0.0001 →362880 *1.55e-4 * 0.0001.

362880 *1.55e-4 = 362880 * 0.000155 = let's compute that:

362880 → 362,880.

362,880 * 0.000155 = 362,880 *1.55e-4.

Compute 362,880 *1.55 = ?

362,880 * 1 =362,880.

362,880 *0.5=181,440.

362,880 *0.05=18,144.

So sum: 362,880 +181,440=544,320; +18,144 →562,464.

So 362,880 *1.55=562,464.

Multiply by 1e-4: 562,464 *1e-4=56.2464.

But wait, that's 362880 *1.55e-4 =56.2464.

Then multiply by 0.0001: 56.2464 *0.0001=0.00562464 M.

Wait, no, wait: 362880 * x * s^4 → x=1.55e-4; s=0.1, s^4=0.0001.

So 362880 *1.55e-4 *0.0001 = 362880 *1.55e-8.

Wait, 362880 *1.55e-8= 362880 *1.55e-8.

Compute 362880 *1.55 = 362880 *1.55=562,464.

Multiply by 1e-8 →562,464e-8 =5.62464e-3 M.

So [Co(SCN)_4]^2- ≈5.62464e-3 M.

Now, let's sum all the complex concentrations:

[CoSCN]^+ →1.395e-4 ≈0.0001395 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] →5.58e-4 ≈0.000558 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- →3.5194e-3 ≈0.0035194 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- →5.62464e-3 ≈0.00562464 M.

Sum of complexes: 0.0001395 +0.000558 +0.0035194 +0.00562464 ≈

Let's compute:

0.0001395 +0.000558 =0.0006975.

0.0006975 +0.0035194 =0.0042169.

0.0042169 +0.00562464 =0.00984154.

Plus the free Co^2+ (x) =1.55e-4 ≈0.000155.

So total concentration: 0.00984154 +0.000155 ≈0.00999654 ≈0.01 M, which matches the given total. So that's correct.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is [Co(SCN)_2].

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] is 5.58e-4 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M.

So the percentage is (5.58e-4 /0.01)*100 =5.58%.

But that's about 5.58%, which isn't any of the options provided (A:42.3%, B:25.6%, C:38.1%, D:16.9%).

Hmm, that's a problem. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the fractions.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fractions as (β1 β2 s^2)/(D), but D includes the free Co term. Wait, no, because D is the sum of all complex terms plus the free Co term.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the approach of considering the denominator as the sum of all the terms, including the free Co. Because when the free Co is included, the fraction is (K2 x s²) / (x (1 + K1 s + K2 s² + K3 s^3 + K4 s^4 )) ) → (K2 s² ) / (1 + K1 s + K2 s² + K3 s^3 + K4 s^4 ) ) → which is (β1 β2 s² ) / (1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s² + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4 ) → which is what I calculated earlier as 5.5555%, which is about 5.5555%.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the denominator. Let me check again.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I thought that the denominator was the sum of the terms for each complex including the free Co as 1. But perhaps the denominator is the sum of all possible complexes, excluding the free Co. Because earlier, when I computed the fractions, the denominator was D=64.468, which includes the free Co as 1.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution."

So all cobalt containing species include all complexes and the free Co^2+.

So when calculating the percentage, it's [Co(SCN)_2] divided by the total Co concentration (which includes all complexes and free Co).

Wait, but in my earlier approach using the fractions, each f_i is the fraction of that species relative to all species, including free Co.

Wait, but when I computed f2=5.5555%, that's the fraction relative to the total.

So the percentage is 5.5555%, but that's not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the problem again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the cumulative β values, not the stepwise ones. Because sometimes, the stability constants are given as cumulative, meaning β_total for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of all β1 to βn.

Wait, but the problem statement says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Which suggests that β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So they are stepwise, not cumulative.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the denominator. Let me think about the denominator again.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be the sum of the terms, each term being the product of β's up to that n multiplied by s^n. But perhaps for the free ion, it's just 1, and the other terms are the complexes.

So D =1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s^2 + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4.

Which is what I did earlier, giving D=64.468.

So, [Co(SCN)_2] is (β1 β2 s² ) / D → 3.6/64.468≈5.5555%.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe the question is asking about the sum of all dithiocyanato complexes, which would include n=2 and n=4? No, because n=4 is a tetrathiocyanato complex, which is four SCN- ions. So that's not the same as dithiocyanato.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2], but the problem says "dithiocyanato" which refers to two SCN- ligands. So [Co(SCN)_2] is the correct species.

Hmm. Maybe I should check the options again. The closest option to 5.55% is D:16.9%, but that's way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator.

s=0.1.

n=0:1.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:9*40*(0.1)^2=9*40*0.01=3.6.

n=3:9*40*63*(0.1)^3=9*40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880; 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So D=1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that seems correct.

Hmm. Maybe the mistake is that I used the stepwise β's but the problem expects the cumulative β's.

Wait, sometimes in stability constants, β is given for the overall complex, not stepwise. For example, β1 for [CoSCN]^+ is 9, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2] is 40, but that would be the overall β for the second complex, not the stepwise. So if β2 is the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2], then β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 would represent the overall constants, not stepwise.

In that case, the stepwise β's would be different. Let me think.

If β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+ → β1=9.

β2 is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_2] → β2=40.

But stepwise β2 would be β2/β1 =40/9 ≈4.444.

Similarly, stepwise β3 would be β3/β2=63/40=1.575.

β4 (overall) is 16, but stepwise β4 would be β4/β3=16/63≈0.254.

Wait, but then the approach would be different because each β is the cumulative constant, not the stepwise.

In that case, the formation of [Co(SCN)_2] would have β2=40, which is the product β1 * β2_stepwise, where β2_stepwise =40/9≈4.444.

In this scenario, the denominator would be based on the stepwise β's.

But this complicates things because we don't have the stepwise β's, only the overall β's.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the overall stability constants, not stepwise.

In that case, the denominator terms would be based on the overall β's.

Wait, but that's a different approach. Let me try that.

If the β's are overall, then:

For [Co(SCN)_n], the stability constant is βn.

So [CoSCN]^+ → β1=9.

[Co(SCN)_2] → β2=40.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- → β4=16.

In this case, the denominator would be 1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s^4.

Plugging in:

s=0.1.

Term n=0:1.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum D=1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016= 2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

The numerator for [Co(SCN)_2] is β2 s²=40*(0.1)^2=0.4.

So f2=0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 →16.9%.

Ah, that's option D:16.9%.

So perhaps the problem assumes that the β's are overall stability constants, not stepwise. So that's why the earlier approach didn't match, but this approach gives one of the options.

So the correct answer would be 16.9%, option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and thiocyanate concentration.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants: \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

The stability constants are interpreted as **cumulative stability constants**, meaning \( \beta_n \) represents the overall stability constant for the complex \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_n ]\). The distribution of cobalt species is determined using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

where \( f_n \) is the fraction of the \( n \)-th cobalt species.

### Denominator Calculation:
The denominator \( D \) is the sum of contributions from all cobalt species:

\[
D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

Substituting \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \):

- \( n = 0 \): \( 1 \)
- \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
- \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
- \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]:
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_2 ]\) is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Percentage Calculation:
The percentage of \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_2 ]\) among all cobalt-containing species is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = f_2 \cdot 100 = 0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.
