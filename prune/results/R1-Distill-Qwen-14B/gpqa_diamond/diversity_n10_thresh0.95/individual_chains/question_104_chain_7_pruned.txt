Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through each part.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two planets, each around stars with the same mass as the Sun. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The orbits are circular, which probably simplifies some calculations.

The problem states that the spectral line shifts for each star were different. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I'm supposed to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D.

Hmm, radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit, but since the problem says both are detected, the inclinations must be such that the Doppler effect is measurable (so probably not edge-on if that would minimize the shift, but maybe they are both optimally aligned for detection).

Wait, the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) relates to the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. I remember that the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and other factors.

The formula I recall is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )) / (2π ) )^(1/3) ) ... Wait, maybe I should think about the more precise formula.

Another approach: The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( P^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) ) )

But since both planets have masses similar to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_p is much smaller than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So, simplifying, the denominator becomes M_*^(2/3) * (1 + ... ), but since M_p is small, we can approximate it as M_*.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) * (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( sin i ) / (2π )^(1/3) )

But since e is zero (or approximately, because the orbits are circular), that term is 1. Also, since the inclination i is the same? Well, the problem doesn't specify, but I think in the RV method, the measured K depends on sin i. But for exoplanets, unless the orbit is edge-on (i=90), we wouldn't detect the planet. Wait, no, the RV method can detect planets even if the inclination isn't exactly 90 degrees, but the measured K is maximum when i=90 (edge-on). However, if the actual inclination is smaller, the measured K is lower. But in this problem, both planets have been detected, so their K values are significant.

But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the inclination angles being different, so maybe we can assume that both are at the same inclination, or that the sini factor is the same for both. Because if i is different, it complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the sini factors are the same for both, so they cancel out when taking the ratio.

So, let's think in terms of K1 and K2 for the two planets.

K1 = (some constants) * (M_p1) / (M_*^(1/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = same constants * M_p2 / ( M_*^(1/3) * P2^(1/3) )

Wait, but since M_p1 and M_p2 are similar to Neptune. Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses. Let's say both planets have the same mass, M_p1 = M_p2. So M_p cancels out when taking the ratio.

So,

K1 / K2 = (P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

Because when you write K1/K2 = [ (M_p same) / (M_* same)^(1/3) * (P1)^(1/3) ) ] / [ same for P2 ]

Wait, no, better to write the equations again.

K = ( ( (27 * pi^2 ) / (2 * G ) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and sin i is the same for both (assuming same i, but maybe it's not given). Wait, but the problem says the stars have the same masses, and planets have similar masses. But K is given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but milliangstrom is a unit of length, so the actual velocities would be in terms of velocity = (lambda shift) / lambda * c.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the wavelength shift with velocity. The RV method measures the velocity of the star toward or away from us. So, the shift in wavelength (delta lambda) is related to velocity by the formula:

delta_lambda / lambda = v / c

Where c is the speed of light. So, if you have a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and the wavelength is in the optical range, say around 500 nm (which is 5000 angstroms), then delta_lambda is 5e-3 angstroms. So, delta_lambda = 5e-3 angstroms. So, v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

Wait, but the problem gives the shifts as 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms. So, delta_lambda is 5
