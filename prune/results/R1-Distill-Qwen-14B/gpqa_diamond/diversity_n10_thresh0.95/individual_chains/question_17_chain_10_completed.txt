Okay, I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct concentration of calcium ions.

Hmm, so I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is a 1:1 complex since it's stoichiometric. So the formula would be something like CaY²- where Y is the EDTA part.

The K given is the formation constant, Kf, right? Formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Or wait, sometimes EDTA is in its deprotonated form; maybe I should think about that.

Wait, the problem says pH is ideal. EDTA requires a certain pH to deprotonate and form the complex. At pH 10, EDTA is usually in a form that can chelate metals effectively. But here, since the pH is ideal, I probably don't need to worry about the EDTA's protonation state. So I can assume that all the EDTA is in the form that can form the complex.

So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote the concentration of CaY²- as 0.02 M. The question is, what is the concentration of Ca²+ ions in the solution?

Wait, because the complex dissociates a bit. In solution, the complex might not be 100% intact. So the equilibrium would be:

CaY²- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴-

The formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [Ca²+][Y⁴-]/[CaY²-]

Wait, no, wait. Formation constant is the reverse of that. Because Kf is for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + Y^4- ⇌ CaY²− 

So Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) 

Which is the same as the expression I wrote earlier.

But in this problem, we're dealing with the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and Y^4-. So the dissociation constant would be Kd, which is the inverse of Kf. So Kd = 1/Kf. Because Kd is the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction.

So, Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4-]/[CaY²−] = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. If Kf is 5e10, that's a very large number, so the complex is very stable. So the dissociation constant Kd will be very small, which makes sense because the complex doesn't dissociate much.

Now, at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is close to 0.02 M, but a tiny amount dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-. Let me denote the dissociated Ca²+ concentration as x. So the change in the complex is -x, and both Ca²+ and Y^4- increase by x.

So the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small because Kd is tiny)

[Ca²+] = x

[Y^4-] = x

So substituting into Kd:

Kd = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02

We know Kd is 2e-11, so:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me calculate 4e-13 squared.

Wait no, sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5). Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. Wait, 6.5 *2 is 13. So yes, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. Because 1e-7 is 1e-7, but 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches.

So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I mix up Kf and Kd correctly? Let me double-check. Kf is formation constant: Ca²+ + Y^4- ⇌ CaY²−, Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]). So yes, Kd is 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Yes, that part seems correct.

Also, since the complex doesn't dissociate much, x is very small compared to 0.02, so ignoring x in the denominator is a valid approximation. So [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02 M.

So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is approximately 0.02 M (since \( K_d \) is very small, the dissociation is minimal). Let the concentration of dissociated \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{Y}^{4-} \) be \( x \). The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_d = \frac{x \cdot x}{0.02} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
