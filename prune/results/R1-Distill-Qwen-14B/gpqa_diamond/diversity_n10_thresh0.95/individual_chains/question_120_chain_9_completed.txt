Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from different points in Earth's orbit, right? So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Like, the formula I think is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So if a star's parallax is plx, then distance d = 1/plx.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So they're asking, if I make a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would I expect in that range?

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed. Oh, wait, in reality, stars aren't truly uniform, but the question says to assume they are. So the number density is the same throughout space. But wait, number per unit volume? Or per unit parallax?

So, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume depends on the volume. But how does that translate to parallax? Since volume is related to distance, and parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

Let me think. Let's model this. Let's say the number density of stars is n per cubic parsec. So in a small volume dV, the number of stars is n * dV.

What's dV in terms of distance? Well, if I consider a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n *4π d² dr.

But parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx, maybe? Because d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, let me compute that. Let me see, if d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, because differentiating d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since dr is positive when d is increasing (so plx is decreasing), maybe for the purposes of integration, I can take the absolute value.

So the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is approximately n * 4π (d)^2 dr. Substituting d=1/plx and dr= (1/plx²) dplx (taking absolute value), we get:

Number = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, dr is (1/plx²) dplx, because dr = - (1/plx²) dplx → |dr| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting:

dN = n * 4π (d)^2 * dr. Since d = 1/plx, so d^2 = 1/(plx^2), and dr is (1/plx^2) dplx.

So plugging in:

dN = n *4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number density in plx space is going as 1/plx^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So for a given plx, the number of stars in a small range dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the count goes as 1/plx^4. So the correct option would be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but another approach: think of the volume as a function of parallax. The number of stars depends on the volume between plx and plx + dplx. But wait, what's the volume corresponding to a certain parallax?

Wait, no. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So as plx increases, distance decreases. So higher parallax means closer stars. So when you have a small change in plx, say, from plx to plx + dplx (which is an increase in plx), the corresponding change in distance is from d=1/plx to d=1/(plx+dplx). But for small dplx, this is approximately d = 1/plx - (dplx)/(plx²). So the change in distance dr is approximately d = -dplx/(plx²). So the thickness of the shell at distance d is dr, which is proportional to 1/(plx^2).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of volume per unit parallax. Let's think about the volume between plx and plx + dplx.

Wait, no, because plx is inversely proportional to distance. So the volume between a distance d and d + dr is 4π d² dr. But since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx.

So the volume element dV = 4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/(plx^2) dplx ). The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but when considering the magnitude, it's 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that dV is n * dV, which is n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So when plx is small (meaning stars are far away), you have more stars in a given dplx? Or less?

Wait, when plx is small, 1/plx is large, so 1/plx^4 is even larger. So the number of stars per unit plx range is higher for smaller plx? Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Because when plx is small (distance large), the volume element is larger, so more stars should be in a given dplx in that region.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, the number per unit dplx is n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So when plx is smaller (like 0.01 arcsec), the number is much bigger than when plx is 10 arcsec. So, as plx increases, the number per unit dplx decreases.

So the number per unit plx range (dplx) is inversely proportional to plx^4. Which would mean the answer is A: ~ 1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. The parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the thickness \( dr \) becomes \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) (taking the absolute value for simplicity). The volume element \( dV \) in terms of parallax is then:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the number density \( n \) of stars and the volume \( dV \), so:

\[
dN = n \cdot dV = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( d\text{plx} \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, as \( \text{plx} \) increases, the number of stars per unit \( d\text{plx} \) decreases more steeply than any other power of \( \text{plx} \).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
