Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement, like a mass on a spring. But wait, this is the relativistic version, so I guess things are a bit different because of special relativity.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. Let me think about the basics. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would occur when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. So the non-relativistic max speed would be when (1/2)kA² equals (1/2)mv², leading to v_max squared equals (kA²)/m. So non-relativistic v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But since this is a relativistic problem, I shouldn't just pick option C without considering relativity.

Wait, in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic plus potential. The total energy includes the rest mass energy. So in the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy mc² and the kinetic energy. But the oscillator's potential and kinetic energies are still related in some way, but perhaps modified by relativistic effects.

Wait, wait. So the total mechanical energy in the oscillator would include both the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. Let me think, the potential energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator may still be (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is not (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc² where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy E is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At maximum velocity (x=0), all energy is kinetic.

So at x=0: E = (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, no, because when the mass is at x=A, it's at maximum displacement, so potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E would be (1/2)kA².

But wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy E is also equal to γ mc². Because the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) equals the total relativistic energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic.

Wait, that might not be the case. Let me clarify. In a standard relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (γ -1)mc². So the total energy E is (γ -1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

At the points where x= ±A, the velocity is zero, so γ is 1 (since v=0, γ=1). Therefore, at x=A, E = (1-1)mc² + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA².

But wait, when x=0, the potential energy is zero. So all energy is kinetic. Therefore, E must equal the kinetic energy at x=0. But E is also the same as when x=A. So:

At x=0:
E = kinetic energy = (γ -1) mc².

At x=A:
E = (1/2)kA².

So setting them equal: (γ -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but the total energy E is supposed to be conserved. So the total energy is actually (γ -1) mc² + (1/2)k x². Wait, no, no. Wait, in the relativistic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies are both present. So the total energy E is the sum of both, which equals the relativistic energy (γ mc²), but that might not be correct because in a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the total energy is γ mc², which includes rest mass energy. So in that case, the sum of the mechanical energies (kinetic and potential) would be equal to (γ -1) mc². Because the total energy is γ mc², so subtracting rest energy gives the kinetic, which is (γ -1) mc², and adding potential.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me restate:

In non-relativistic mechanics, the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx². For the oscillator, E is conserved. At maximum displacement, x=A, v=0, so E=(1/2)kA². At x=0, E= (1/2)mv_max².

In relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So the total mechanical energy is E = (γ -1) mc² + (1/2)k x².

But wait, the total energy of the system from relativity's perspective is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. So E_total = γ mc². But that's the entire energy, including rest mass. But the mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is E_mech = (γ -1) mc² + (1/2)k x².

Hmm, perhaps I should think that the mechanical energy E_mech is conserved in the oscillator. So E_mech = (1/2)kA², as when x=A, v=0, all energy is potential. So at x=0, E_mech = (γ -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So let me write that equation:

(γ -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

We can solve for γ.

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable for simplicity. Let me call it D.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + D.

We can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + D)^2.

Rearranged:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + D)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1+D)^2.

1 - 1/(1+D)^2 = [ (1+D)^2 -1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2D + D²) -1 = 2D + D².

So,

v²/c² = (2D + D²)/( (1+D)^2 ).

But D is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ (2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ))^2.

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c²).

So numerator becomes (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ).

Putting it over a common denominator, but maybe it's better to factor.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor the numerator.

Wait, 2D + D² = D(2 + D).

So,

v²/c² = [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Hmm, let me compute D again.

D = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Simplify the numerator:

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) = (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ] ?

Wait, maybe I should write 2 as 2*(2 m c²)/(2 m c²) to have a common denominator.

Wait, 2 = (4 m c²)/(2 m c²).

So,

2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) = [4 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c²).

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

Wait, the denominator is (1 + D)^2. Since 1 + D = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

Denominator squared is [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

So putting it all together:

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2/( (2 m c²)^2 ) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: [k A²/(2 m c²)] * [ (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] = [k A² (4 m c² + k A²)] / [ (2 m c²)^2 ].

Denominator: [ (2m c² + k A²)^2 ] / (2 m c²)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

Which becomes:

[ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²)^2 ] * [ (2 m c²)^2 / (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ) ]

The (2 m c²)^2 terms cancel out.

So,

v²/c² = [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, let's factor this expression.

Looking at the numerator:

k A² (4 m c² + k A²) = k A² [ 2*(2 m c²) + k A² ].

Wait, the denominator is (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Let me factor out 2 m c² from the numerator's term:

4 m c² = 2 * 2 m c².

So,

4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2 = (2 m c²)(2) ) + k A².

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the expression as:

v²/c² = [ (k A²) * (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

We can write this as:

v²/c² = [ (k A² / (2 m c² + k A² )) * (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² ).

Wait, that might not lead me anywhere.

Wait, another approach: let me factor the denominator as (something):

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) = k A² [ 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2 ].

So,

v²/c² = [k A² (2 (2 m c²) + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 2 m c² as a common term.

Wait, 4 m c² is 2*(2 m c²). So,

v²/c² = [k A² (2*(2 m c²) + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Let me denote X = 2 m c² + k A^2.

Then,

v²/c² = [k A² (2*(X - k A^2/2 ) + k A^2 ) ] / X².

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator in terms of X.

Wait, 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2 = 4 m c² + k A^2.

But I'm not seeing a clear simplification. Maybe I should compute it numerically in terms of X.

Let me think, perhaps I can write 4 m c² + k A² as 2*(2 m c²) + k A² = 2*( (2 m c²) ) + k A².

But 2 m c² is part of X, since X = 2 m c² + k A².

Hmm, perhaps we can express the numerator as 2 * (2 m c²) + k A²) * k A².

Wait, the numerator is k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) = k A² (4 m c² + k A²).

Hmm.

Alternatively, let me compute this expression as:

v²/c² = [ (k A²) (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )².

Let me factor the numerator:

4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator as k A² (4 m c² + k A²) = k A² [ 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2 ].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor 2 m c² as a common term.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to move ahead and see which option matches.

Looking at the options:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Wait, let's compute 1 - 1/(something squared). Hmm, perhaps 1/(1 + D)^2, where D is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So 1/(1+D)^2.

Wait, in my earlier expression, v²/c² = [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Because earlier, I had v²/c² = [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2, where D = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v²/c² = D (2 + D) / (1 + D)^2.

Let me compute this:

D (2 + D) = 2 D + D².

(1 + D)^2 = 1 + 2 D + D².

So,

v²/c² = (2 D + D²)/(1 + 2 D + D²).

Hmm, maybe we can factor this.

Wait, 2D + D² = D (2 + D), but that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, another approach: Let me factor the denominator.

Denominator: 1 + 2 D + D² = (1 + D)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [D (2 + D)] / (1 + D)^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as:

v²/c² = [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Wait, wait a minute, let me think. Maybe I can express 2 + D as (1 + D) + 1.

So,

2 + D = (1 + D) +1.

So,

v²/c² = D [ (1 + D) + 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Which is:

v²/c² = D [ (1 + D + 1) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the fraction as:

v²/c² = [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, 2 + D can be written as ( (1 + D) ) +1.

Not sure. Let me try plugging in D = (k A²)/(2 m c²), to see if I can relate to the options.

Wait, looking at option D:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

So, squaring that,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2, where D is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, my expression for v²/c² is [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

1 - 1/(1+D)^2 = [ (1+D)^2 -1 ] / (1+D)^2.

The numerator is 1 + 2 D + D² -1 = 2 D + D².

So,

1 - 1/(1+D)^2 = (2 D + D²) / (1 + D)^2.

Which is exactly what I have for v²/c².

So,

v²/c² = (2 D + D²)/(1 + D)^2 = 1 - 1/(1+D)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + D)^2 ].

So,

v/c = sqrt(1 - [1/(1+D)^2 ] )

Which can be written as:

v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/(1 + D)^2 )).

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2 ), where D = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, option D is written as:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Which is exactly what I have.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total mechanical energy of the oscillator is conserved and includes both relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   At maximum velocity (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the total energy at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = A \), we have:  
   \[
   (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]

2. **Solving for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Rearranging the above equation gives:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Let \( D = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + D)^2
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + D)^2}
   \]

3. **Final Expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Substituting \( D = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}
   \]  
   This matches **Option D**.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression does not match the derived formula and introduces an incorrect term in the square root.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The denominator inside the square root is not properly squared, leading to an invalid expression.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This represents the non-relativistic maximum speed and does not account for relativistic effects.  
- **Option D**: Correct. It matches the derived formula for \( v_{\text{max}} \) in the relativistic case.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: D**
