Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a PPh3 type of reaction, but wait, no, that's for different things. Oh right, red phosphorus with HI is commonly used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Or wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh, right! The reaction of an alkyl chloride with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to an elimination reaction. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Red phosphorus and HI (or another halogen like Br2) are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Oh wait, no, that's the hydrolysis using H3O+ and heat. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI—oh, right! That's used in the substitution of a nitrile group. Wait, no, perhaps it's the conversion of an alkyne to an alkene via a dehydrohalogenation? Or wait, maybe it's about the formation of alkenes from dihalides. Alternatively, red phosphorus is sometimes used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings and requires ammonia or something else.

Wait, maybe I should first focus on determining what Compound X is based on the given spectral data. Because knowing the structure of X will help me figure out what reaction it undergoes.

So, let's look at the IR and NMR data.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, possibly due to O-H or N-H stretching. But the other peaks are 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1.

The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to either a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid). But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be very broad, around 2500-3300. The peak in the 3400-2500 region here is broad, which could indicate an O-H group. But wait, another possibility is an ester (but esters have carbonyl around 1720). Alternatively, maybe a ketone. Hmm.

The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around the area where aromatic rings (C=C stretching) appear. So that suggests that the compound has an aromatic ring.

Now, looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is probably an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm and not as downfield as 10.5. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait—if the compound has an aromatic ring (as suggested by the IR peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1), the NMR should show aromatic protons. Let me check the other signals.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. That's typical of an aromatic ring with substituents in the para positions. For example, if there's a substituent on the benzene ring in the para position, the protons on the ring would be as doublets. So 8.0 ppm suggests maybe a strongly deshielded aromatic proton, like adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group such as a carbonyl.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, but at a lower ppm, around 7.2. So maybe the ring has two substituents in the para positions, which would cause the protons to couple and give doublets. So perhaps an aromatic ring with two substituents in para positions, like a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

Wait, but in para-substituted benzene, each substituent would cause the neighboring protons to be deshielded. So if there are two substituents in para positions, like a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to split into doublets. For example, maybe a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, each being an electron-withdrawing group, leading to downfield shifts.

Wait, but let me think about the substituents. If the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid, that would deshield the adjacent protons, making them appear downfield. So if the ring has two carbonyl groups or one carbonyl group, but that would complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester or another group that causes the ring protons to split into a doublet.

Wait, but looking back, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound has a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached, as in a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but let's look at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for 1H. This could be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom, perhaps. Or maybe a CH group in a chain, like a CH2CH2 group attached to something.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet for two protons. Maybe CH2 groups adjacent to another CH or something else.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet as a doublet? Wait, the integration is 3H, and it's a doublet. A doublet for 3H suggests that it's a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself attached to something else. Like a CH(CH3) group. For example, a -CH(CH3)- group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal methyl group. So that's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl chain attached to something.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with substituents. Let me try to sketch it.

The aromatic signals are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, both doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Hmm, but wait, if it's a monosubstituted benzene, the protons adjacent to the substituent would be a doublet, and the protons opposite would be another doublet. So maybe the substituent is in one position, and the ring has two types of protons each as doublets.

Wait, no. For example, if the substituent is in the para position relative to another group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta substitution, but that wouldn't give doublets for both sets.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an ester) attached to the benzene ring. Let's consider that.

So, the substituent is something like -CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Then, the ring would have two sets of protons: those adjacent to the carbonyl group would be more deshielded, hence appearing around 8.0 ppm as a doublet, and the others would be less deshielded, maybe at 7.2 ppm.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the NMR more.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). So, if the compound is a para-substituted benzoic acid, perhaps. For example, 4-ethylbenzoic acid would have the carboxylic acid proton at around 10 ppm.

Wait, but the other protons on the benzene would be in para positions. Let me think—so, if the substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 4, and perhaps another substituent in position 1? Hmm, but wait, the substituents would influence the ring protons.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which corresponds to a carbonyl. If the compound is a benzoic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, so that fits. The O-H stretch would be broad around 3400-2500 cm-1, which matches the IR data.

So, if it's a benzoic acid with substituents, let's see the NMR.

Other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H).

So that suggests an ethyl group attached to a carbon, perhaps. Because the 0.9 ppm triplet is likely a CH2CH3 group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be the CH2 adjacent to a CH, and the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to another group.

Wait, that sounds like an isobutyl group. Let me see. For example, an isobutyl group would have a CH(CH3)CH2- group. So the structure could be something like 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but let me think. Benzoic acid has the structure C6H5COOH. If there's an isobutyl group attached at the para position, the structure would be 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid.

But let's check the NMR for that. In 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid, the substituent is an isobutyl group (CH2CH(CH3)2) attached at position 4.

The isobutyl group would have the following protons:

- The CH(CH3)2 group would have a CH which is split into a multiplet (since it's adjacent to two CH3 groups). The CH3 groups would be as triplet or something else.

Wait, but in the NMR data, we have 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H).

Hmm, 1.4 ppm as a doublet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. For example, in an isobutyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Wait, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, I think isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the central CH would have two CH3 groups attached. So the NMR would show a triplet for the CH3 groups attached to the central CH, and a quartet for the CH2 next to that.

Wait, but the data here is 0.9 (t,3H) which is a triplet, so that's the terminal CH2CH3 group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) might be the CH2 adjacent to the central CH. And the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the two CH3 groups on the central CH—wait, but that's 6 H total, but the integration here is 3H. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3). No, wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), no, wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, but that's not correct. The correct structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not correct either. Let me think: the four carbons in the butyl group. The primary butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-; the secondary (sec) is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (sec-butyl) group attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

In that case, the substituent would have the following protons:

- The CH2 group attached to the ring (the first CH2) would have protons that are a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH).

- The central CH would be attached to two CH3 groups (but wait, no, in a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the NMR data. The signals are:

- 10.5 (1H, O-H of carboxylic acid)

- 8.0 (2H, para to substituent)

- 7.2 (2H, maybe the other para protons)

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, there are two sets of protons: the two adjacent to the substituent (ortho) and the two across (para). But in an aromatic ring, the ortho and para protons would each form a doublet if the substituent is in a certain position. Wait, for example, if the substituent is in the para position relative to another substituent, then each set of protons would be a doublet.

But perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group in the para position relative to another group, like an ethyl group. Let me try to imagine the structure as 4-ethylbenzoic acid. But wait, that would have the substituents as an ethyl group and a carboxylic acid group in para positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, let me try to piece this together again. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl group. The broad peak in the IR (3400-2500) suggests an O-H group, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. For a para-substituted benzoic acid, the ortho protons (adjacent to the substituent) would be at higher ppm, say around 8.0, and the meta protons (if any) would be at lower ppm. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzoic acid, the ring would have two substituents: the carboxylic acid and another group. So, for example, if the substituent is at position 4 and another group at position 1, but that's not possible because benzene is a ring. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in position 4 and another substituent is in position 1. No, that's the same as position 4.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carboxylic acid group, and there's another substituent in the para position. Let's say the structure is 4-(substituent)benzoic acid.

So, for example, if the substituent is an ethyl group, then the structure is 4-ethylbenzoic acid.

In that case, the benzene ring would have the carboxylic acid group at position 1 and an ethyl group at position 4. But wait, that's the same as having substituents at para positions relative to each other.

In such a structure, the aromatic protons would be as follows: the ortho protons to the -COOH group would be at higher ppm (around 8.0), and the ortho protons to the ethyl group would be at lower ppm, say around 7.2, as in the NMR data.

So, the NMR would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which fits the NMR data. So that seems to fit.

Now, the other NMR signals: the 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). These suggest an ethyl group attached perhaps to a CH group.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a terminal CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 next to the CH, and the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) is the CH itself.

Putting this together, the structure would be a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a substituent that is an ethyl group attached via a CH group. So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but more likely, it's the ethyl group attached via a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a CH. Let me think. The substituent would be -CH2CH2CH3, but that's a primary propyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an isopropyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR shows a CH (1H at 2.9 ppm), a CH2 (2H at 1.7), a CH3 (3H at 1.4 as a doublet), and a CH2CH3 (3H at 0.9 as a triplet). Hmm.

Wait, that would fit a substituent like -CH2CH(CH3)2, but that's a tertiary butyl group. Let me see: the substituent would be a tert-butyl group, which is (CH3)3C-.

But wait, the tert-butyl group would have a singlet for the nine H's (three CH3 groups attached to a central C). But in the NMR, the signals are separate, so that doesn't fit. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH3 group. No,
