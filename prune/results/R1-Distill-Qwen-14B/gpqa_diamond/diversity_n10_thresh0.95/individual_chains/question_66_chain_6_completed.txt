Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model symmetries. So the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is built on top of that. So all SMEFT operators should maintain Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is a must.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, in effective field theories, we usually work in a fixed background, like a Minkowski space. So do the operators in SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it that the whole theory is Poincare invariant, but individual operators might not be? I think the effective theory as a whole respects Poincare, but I'm not too sure about individual operators. Maybe each operator must respect Poincare? Because otherwise, the theory wouldn't be consistent. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Because Poincare includes translations, which would relate to momentum conservation. But SMEFT operators typically don't have explicit momentum dependence, so perhaps they automatically respect translation invariance? Or maybe they don't, but the theory as a whole does. Not entirely sure, but I'll come back to this.

CP symmetry—does SMEFT require all operators to respect CP? I think the SMEFT doesn't enforce any particular CP symmetry. Because in the Standard Model, the weak interactions violate CP, and the effective theory can have operators that violate it. For example, the dimension-six operators include terms that can break CP, like the (S) operators in the Warsaw basis. So not all operators must respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must. So any answer including 3 is out, which would eliminate option B and D. Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if some operators don't respect CP, then 3 is not a required symmetry. So option 3 is out.

CPT symmetry—I think all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. The Standard Model respects CPT, and SMEFT being an extension should as well. So each operator must be CPT invariant. So option 4 is definitely in.

So now, back to Poincare symmetry. The question is whether all operators must respect Poincare. So Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare, but translation is another part. Do the operators have to be individually Poincare invariant? Or is it that the theory as a whole is Poincare invariant?

Wait, in effective field theories, operators are written in a way that the theory remains Lorentz invariant. But Poincare includes translations. For instance, operators like operators with derivatives are fine because they have Lorentz indices, but translation invariance would require that the form of the operator doesn't change under spacetime translations. But operators in SMEFT are local, so I think they do respect translation invariance. Because each operator is a local term; their form doesn't depend on any particular point in space except through fields, which themselves transform covariantly. So perhaps each operator respects Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but wait. The operators are terms in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is a function of fields and their derivatives. For translation invariance, the Lagrangian should be invariant under spacetime translations, but individual terms might not be, but when you sum them up, the total is. But in SMEFT, the operators are constructed respecting the symmetries. So maybe each operator is Poincare invariant.

But I'm a bit uncertain. Another approach: think about what the SM respects. The Standard Model is Poincare invariant. SMEFT is an extension where each operator is a higher-dimensional term but still written in a way that the theory remains Poincare invariant. Therefore, each operator must respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2 must be correct.

So, the symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So the correct answer would include 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. So wait, but we have to include CPT as well. So the answer should include 1,2,4.

Wait, but another thought: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if 2 is included, then 1 is redundant. But the question is asking which must be respected. So perhaps both must be respected.

Wait, no. Because the Poincare group includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. So if 2 is correct, then 1 is automatically correct. So the question is whether all operators must respect both 1 and 2.

But in this context, SMEFT operators must respect the SM gauge group and the Poincare symmetry. So each operator must respect Poincare. So 2 is correct, and 1 is also correct, but perhaps 1 is a subset of 2.

So the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT (4). So the options would be 1,2,4, which is option C.

Wait, but another point: Some sources say that the SMEFT is built respecting the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. But I'm not sure about Poincare. Let me try to think. The Poincare symmetry is more about the spacetime translations. In effective field theories, when you write operators, you're assuming that the theory is invariant under translations, which is why you can write the Lagrangian as a local function. So SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So yes, 2 must be included.

So the correct answer would include 1,2,4. So option C is 1,2,4. So the choices are option C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must preserve Lorentz symmetry, as it is a fundamental symmetry of the theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations. SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that ensures the theory as a whole respects Poincaré symmetry. Since the Lagrangian is a local function of fields and their derivatives, individual operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model allows for CP violation, and SMEFT does not enforce CP symmetry for all operators. Some operators in SMEFT can explicitly violate CP symmetry, as seen in the dimension-six operators of the Warsaw basis. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and SMEFT respects it. All operators in SMEFT must preserve CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
