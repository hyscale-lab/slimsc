--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

So, the question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay length depends on their lifetime and velocity. The decay distance is how far the particle travels before it decays. Oh right, the formula for the mean decay distance is L = gamma * v * ctau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and ctau is the proper lifetime times the speed of light.

But wait, I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Let me think again. The mean lifetime is tau, so ctau is the lifetime multiplied by the speed of light. Gamma is the time dilation factor, so when you multiply by gamma, you get the dilated lifetime, and then multiply by velocity and c to get the distance.

Wait, another approach: The mean proper lifetime is tau = hbar / (Gamma), since the width Gamma is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. Gamma is the total decay width, which is the energy width of the resonance.

So first, I should calculate the proper lifetime tau. The relation is tau = hbar / (Gamma). But wait, I have to make sure about the units here. Gamma is given in MeV, and hbar is in units of GeV·s or something, so I need to convert units properly.

Wait, let me think about the formula. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, the units don't directly match. Let me see: ħ has units of GeV·s (since E=ħ nu, so ħ = E/(nu) and nu is s^-1, so units GeV·s). Γ is in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau would be in seconds.

Wait, but actually, the formula is tau = ħ/(Γ). Let me double-check units. ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, if Γ is in GeV, then tau will be in seconds. But Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So, tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. Let me make that more precise. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. So 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's tau, the proper lifetime.

But then, to find the mean decay length, I also need to consider the velocity of the meson. The decay length L is given by L = gamma * v * tau * c, where c is the speed of light. Wait, more accurately, L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Because v = beta c.

So, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E / m_rest, since E is the total energy. Wait, E_X is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E / (m c²) but since E is already in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps it's just E / m. Let's see. Because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But since E and m are both in GeV, and c² has units, but I think in this context, perhaps the units are arranged so that when E is in GeV, m in GeV/c², then E/(m) would give gamma * c². Hmm, no, maybe I should think in terms of natural units where c=1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma as E / (m c²), but let me check. Alternatively, perhaps for units where c=1, gamma is simply E/m, because E (in GeV) = gamma m (in GeV) * c², but wait, if c=1, then E = gamma m. So, yes, in that case, gamma = E/m. So in our case, E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Alternatively, gamma is 8 GeV divided by 1.2 GeV, which is 6.666..., so gamma ≈ 6.6667.

Now, beta is v/c. How do I find beta? Well, from gamma, beta can be found using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So, solving for beta, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So, gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/gamma^2 is 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute that more precisely. Let me compute 1/gamma^2:

gamma = 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

gamma squared = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444.

1/gamma^2 ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Now, I can compute L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, no: L is gamma multiplied by beta multiplied by c multiplied by tau. Because L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, let me think about the proper units here.

Tau is in seconds, c is in meters per second. So c * tau would be meters. Then, gamma and beta are dimensionless, so L would be in meters.

So, putting it all together:

gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667

beta ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - (9/400)) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Compute the individual parts:

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Tau is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So,

gamma * beta = 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute that.

6.6666667 * 0.9887. Hmm, 6 * 0.9887 is about 5.9322. 0.6666667 * 0.9887 is approximately 0.6591. So total is about 6.5913.

So, 6.5913 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = ?

Wait, let's compute the numbers step by step.

First, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s gives 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625 * 1e-16 m.

Then multiply by gamma * beta, which is approximately 6.5913.

So 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Wait, no, wait: Wait, I think I messed up the order. Let me do it correctly.

Wait, actually, the calculation is:

gamma * beta * c * tau = (gamma * beta) * (c * tau).

I have c * tau as 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

So, 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 m = ?

Let me compute 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16.

6.5913 * 6.170625 is approximately:

Let me compute 6.5913 * 6 = 39.548.

6.5913 * 0.170625 = approximately 1.125.

So total is about 40.673.

So 40.673e-16 meters, which is 4.0673e-15 meters.

Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15, etc. So our calculation is approximately 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I approximated beta as 0.9887, but perhaps a more precise calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma and beta more precisely.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) ) because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But in natural units, E = gamma m, so beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

So, given E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) ) = sqrt( 1 - 0.0225 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Ok, exact value of sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Hmm, 0.9887 squared is 0.9775. Let me check:

0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 + 0.0087^2 = 0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.017052 is 0.977452, plus 0.00007569 gives 0.97752769. Which is a bit more than 0.9775, so my approximation is accurate.

So beta is about 0.9887.

So, more precisely, gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So, gamma * beta is 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6666667 * (0.9887).

Let me compute that more exactly:

6.6666667 × 0.9887.

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6666667 × 0.9887 = 0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.

So, gamma * beta is about 6.5913.

Now, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by gamma * beta: 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Let me compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 is 3.702375e-15.

0.5913 * 6.170625e-16 = let's compute 0.5 *6.170625e-16=3.0853125e-16, 0.0913 *6.170625e-16≈5.635e-17. So total 3.0853125e-16 +5.635e-17= 3.6488e-16.

So total is 3.702375e-15 + 3.6488e-16 = 4.067255e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, but wait, why is my calculation a little higher than the option? Did I make a mistake in the calculation steps?

Let me recheck the tau calculation.

Tau = hbar / Γ.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

6.582 divided by 0.32 equals:

0.32 × 20 is 6.4, 0.32 × 20.56875 = 6.582. Because 0.32 × 20 = 6.4, 0.32 × 0.56875=0.181999... So 6.4 + 0.181999 = 6.581999, which is approximately 6.582. So yes, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta more accurately.

gamma is 20/3 ≈ 6.666666667.

beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=approximately 0.988714.

So, 6.666666667 * 0.988714 = ?

Let me compute that.

6.666666667 * 0.988714.

Let me compute 6 * 0.988714 = 5.932284.

0.666666667 * 0.988714 = let's compute 2/3 * 0.988714 = approximately 0.6591426667.

So total is 5.932284 + 0.6591426667 = 6.591426667.

So gamma * beta is about 6.591426667.

Now, c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So, L = 6.591426667 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Let me compute that:

6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.

0.591426667 *6.170625e-16 = let's compute 0.5 *6.170625e-16 =3.0853125e-16.

0.091426667 *6.170625e-16 ≈ 5.635e-17.

So, 3.0853125e-16 +5.635e-17 = 3.6488625e-16.

Adding that to 3.702375e-15, I get 3.702375e-15 + 3.6488625e-16 = 4.06726125e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.06726e-15 m, which is about 4.067e-15 m. Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Perhaps I made a minor approximation error somewhere, but it's very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator approach.

0.9775. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1-x), where x=0.0225.

sqrt(1-x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x^2/8.

x=0.0225.

So, 1 - 0.0225/2 - (0.0225)^2 /8.

0.0225/2 = 0.01125.

(0.0225)^2 = 0.00050625; divided by 8 is 0.00006328125.

So, 1 - 0.01125 = 0.98875. Then subtract 0.00006328125: 0.98875 - 0.00006328125 = 0.98868671875.

So approximately 0.988687.

So, beta is approximately 0.988687.

So, gamma * beta is 6.666666667 * 0.988687 ≈ 6.666666667 * 0.988687.

Let me compute that:

6 * 0.988687 = 5.932122.

0.666666667 * 0.988687 = ?

0.666666667 is 2/3. So 2/3 * 0.988687 = (2 * 0.988687)/3 ≈ 1.977374 /3 ≈ 0.6591246667.

So total gamma * beta is 5.932122 + 0.6591246667 = 6.591246667.

So, gamma * beta = 6.591246667.

Now, multiply by c * tau:

c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So, 6.591246667 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Let me compute this precisely.

6.591246667 * 6.170625e-16 = ?

Well, 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.

0.591246667 *6.170625e-16 = ?

Compute 0.5 *6.170625e-16 =3.0853125e-16.

0.091246667 *6.170625e-16 = ?

0.09 *6.170625e-16 =5.5535625e-17.

0.001246667 *6.170625e-16 ≈ 7.685e-19.

Adding these: 5.5535625e-17 +7.685e-19 ≈5.6304125e-17.

So, 3.0853125e-16 +5.6304125e-17 =3.64835375e-16.

Adding to 3.702375e-15:

3.702375e-15 is 37.02375e-16.

37.02375e-16 +3.64835375e-16 =40.67210375e-16.

Which is 4.067210375e-15 m.

That's approximately 4.0672e-15 m. Comparing with the options, the closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m. There's a slight discrepancy, but perhaps it's due to more precise calculation of beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Wait, another approach: the mean decay distance can be found using the formula L = c * gamma * beta * tau.

Wait, but wait, tau is the proper mean lifetime, so when you multiply by gamma, you get the dilated lifetime. Then, multiply by beta c to get the distance.

So, L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps another way to compute gamma and beta: using E and m.

E = sqrt( (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So, E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But in units where c=1, gamma is E/m.

So, gamma =8 GeV / 1.2 GeV =6.6666667.

Beta is v/c = (p c c)/(E) ) * (1/c )? Wait, maybe better to compute beta as (pc c)/E, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, beta = (pc c)/E.

Wait, p is the momentum. But perhaps a better approach is to compute beta as (sqrt(E² - m² c^4}) / E ). But in units where c=1, that's beta = sqrt(1 - m²/E²).

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) )=sqrt(1 -0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.988682... as before.

So, beta is approximately 0.988682.

So, gamma * beta is 6.66666667 * 0.988682 ≈6.59124.

Now, c * tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s =6.170625e-16 m.

So, 6.59124 * 6.170625e-16 = ?

Let me compute it:

6.59124 ×6.170625e-16 = let's compute 6.59124 *6.170625 = ?

Compute 6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.59124 ×6.170625:

0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125.

0.09124 ×6.170625 = approximately 0.5625 (since 0.09 *6.170625=0.55535625, and 0.00124 *6.170625≈0.00765 → total 0.56299).

So, 3.0853125 +0.56299=3.6483025.

So, 6.59124 *6.170625e-16 = (37.02375 +3.6483025 )e-16 =40.6720525e-16 =4.06720525e-15 m.

So, around 4.067e-15 m. The options are:

A) 5.0223 *10^-16 m

B)4.0655 *10^-15 m

C)5.0223 *10^-15 m

D)4.0655 *10^-16 m

So, the closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m. The discrepancy is 4.067e-15 vs 4.0655e-15, which is about 0.0015e-15 m difference, which is negligible given the approximations made. So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity in units of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper mean lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the rest mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \):

\[
\gamma^2 = \left( \frac{20}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{400}{9} \approx 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.9775.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Then:

\[
L = (6.6667) \times (0.9887) \times (6.170625 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**. The small discrepancy is due to rounding approximations in intermediate steps.

**Answer: B**
