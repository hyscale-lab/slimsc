Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and determining its geometrical position in the qubits space. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But this one looks a bit different.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because it's an equal mixture of the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩. So the density matrix is a statistical mixture, not a pure state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think this relates to how the density matrix is represented in the Bloch sphere. Oh right, every single-qubit density matrix can be represented as a point on or inside the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector has three components corresponding to the x, y, and z axes.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (rx, ry, rz) and σ are the Pauli matrices. Let me write that out:

ρ = (I + rx X + ry Y + rz Z) / 2,

where I is the identity matrix, and X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let's compute what the given ρ looks like. Let's expand it:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|).

But |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So, ρ = I/2.

Wait, that's the same as (I + 0*X + 0*Y + 0*Z)/2. So the vector r would be (0,0,0). Because rx, ry, rz are all zero. So the point is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The Bloch sphere's surface is for pure states. Mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state is at the origin because it has no coherence and equal population in all states, so it's at the center. Yeah, that makes sense because the density matrix is diagonal and both diagonal elements are 1/2. So the Bloch vector is zero.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. A single-qubit density matrix can generally be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (X, Y, Z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), expanding it shows that it is equal to \(I/2\), which corresponds to \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, consistent with being a maximally mixed state.

Among the options provided:
- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to the state \(|1\rangle\), a pure state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this is the center of the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
