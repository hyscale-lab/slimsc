Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I need to figure out which equation correctly relates the temperatures T1 and T2 of the two stars. Let's think through this step by step.

First, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere depends on the temperature. So, the Boltzmann equation must come into play here.

The Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations N_upper/N_lower equals exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. So, the ratio N1/N2 is 2. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So if I consider the same energy level, the number of atoms in that level would be proportional to the excitation. So N1 = 2 * N2? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So for the same energy level, the excitation (or population in that level) is higher for star_1. So N1/N2 = 2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio N_upper/N_lower equals exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Wait, but the question considers a specific energy level, so maybe it's the same two levels for both stars. So the excitation for each star depends on their respective temperatures.

Wait, for each star, the excitation ratio would be N1/(N1 + N2) or something else? No, wait, the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio is N_upper for star_1 divided by N_upper for star_2 is 2. But I might be mixing up the terms here.

Wait, let me clarify: the excitation is about the number of atoms in an upper energy level relative to the lower. So for each star, the ratio of upper to lower is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let's denote for star 1: r1 = N1_upper / N1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)). Similarly, for star 2: r2 = N2_upper / N2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But the question says that for star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So perhaps the ratio N1_upper/N1_lower is twice that of N2_upper/N2_lower? Or wait, maybe it's about the ratio of the excited state populations in each star.

Wait, the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation ratio (upper to lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So r1 = 2 * r2.

But wait, more accurately, the problem says that the excitation is twice as much. So for each star, their respective r is calculated. So if star_1's r1 is twice star_2's r2, then:

r1 = 2 * r2.

But from the Boltzmann equation, r = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, is this correct? Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the excitation in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2.

Wait, perhaps it's the ratio N_upper/(N_upper + N_lower) that's considered. But that's probably more complicated. Alternatively, the ratio of the number of excited atoms (upper level) compared to the same in the other star.

Wait, the question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps for a specific energy level, the population in that level for star_1 is twice as high as for star_2. But that would imply that N1 = 2 * N2 for the same level. But wait, the same level would be either upper or lower. Or perhaps they are comparing the excitation relative to the ground state.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the number of atoms in the excited state in star 1 is twice that in star 2. So, N1_excited = 2 * N2_excited, assuming the same level. Hmm, but that's more about the number density. But in each star, the excitation is governed by their own temperatures. So the ratio of their excited populations would be [N1_upper / N2_upper] = 2. Or maybe [N1_upper / (N1_upper + N1_lower)] is twice [N2_upper / (N2_upper + N2_lower) ]? No, that's more complicated. I think the question is simpler.

Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is about the ratio of the population of two energy levels. So for each star, the ratio of the upper level to lower level is exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for star 1, r1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2, r2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The question states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, assuming that the excitation is the ratio r, then r1 = 2 * r2.

So,

r1 = 2 * r2

=> exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Hmm, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for T1 and T2.

ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))))

Simplify left side: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))

Which is:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Let me rearrange this:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but wait, let me make sure. Wait, when I move the terms around, let me write it again.

Starting from:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

I can add ΔE/(k T1) to both sides and add ΔE/(k T2) to both sides.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to bring all terms to one side:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Hmm, but the question is looking for an equation involving T1 and T2. Let's see the options and see if this can be rearranged into one of them.

Alternatively, let me rearrange the equation:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by (k/ΔE):

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k) / ΔE

Wait, but the actual value of (k/ΔE) is given as 1.38e-23 J, but wait, the problem says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute k. The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, so k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So k/ΔE = (1.38e-23) / (1.38e-23) ) = 1 K^{-1}.

So (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (k/ΔE) ) = ln(2) * 1.

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which equation matches this? Let's look at the options.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which matches. So the correct equation is option D.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra.

We had:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Take ln both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

→ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE:

ΔE/k (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Which is same as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (k/ΔE )

But since k = ΔE (given ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, same as k), so k/ΔE = 1.

Thus,

1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = ln(2)

Which is same as:

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Which is option D.


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Boltzmann Distribution**: The excitation of atoms in a specific energy level is governed by the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels to the temperature and energy difference:
   \[
   \frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
   \]
   where \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)).

2. **Excitation Ratios**: For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:
   \[
   r_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad r_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
   \]
   Since the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, we have:
   \[
   r_1 = 2 r_2.
   \]

3. **Equating the Ratios**: Substituting the expressions for \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) into \( r_1 = 2 r_2 \), we get:
   \[
   \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
   \]

4. **Simplifying**: Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
