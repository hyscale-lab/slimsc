Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatic potential energy, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. But the mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the thirteenth charge is fixed at P. So I guess point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other twelve are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. Because they're constrained, they can't move closer or further, so their positions are fixed relative to P.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Since the energy is related to the configuration of the charges, I think it's about the electrostatic potential energy. Because in an isolated system, the total energy is conserved, and we're only considering the potential energy here since the mass is negligible. Oh, but wait, the system is isolated, so maybe other forms of energy could be involved, but I think here it's just about the potential energy between the charges.

So, how do I calculate the electrostatic potential energy for a system of multiple charges? I remember that the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But when there are multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

But wait, when you have a system of multiple charges, you have to consider each pair once. So for n charges, the number of unique pairs is n(n-1)/2. But wait, in this case, the setup is a bit different. Some charges are at the same point as P, and others are at a fixed distance from P. Let me think.

The 13th charge is fixed at P. The other twelve are each at 2 meters from P. So each of these twelve is at a distance of 2m from the charge at P. So the potential energy between each of the twelve and the thirteenth charge is the same, right?

Wait, no. Each of the twelve is at 2m from P, but the 13th is at P. So the distance between the 13th and each of the twelve is 2m. So each pair between the 13th and the others is 2m apart.

But then, what about the potential energy between the twelve charges themselves? Since the twelve are all at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't specified. Oh, but the problem says they are "constrained to stay at 2m from P." So their positions must lie on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But how exactly are they arranged? Are they equally spaced or something? Or is their arrangement arbitrary?

Wait, but for the potential energy, the arrangement matters because the distance between each pair of the twelve will affect their mutual potential energy. But without knowing their exact positions, how can I calculate that?

Hmm, wait a minute. The problem asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps there's a way to arrange the twelve charges so that their mutual potential energy is minimized. But I'm a bit confused about that.

Wait, let's think. The potential energy between two charges is given by U = (k * q1 q2) / r. Since all the charges are positive (because each is 2e, and e is positive), bringing them closer together would increase the potential energy because the denominator gets smaller. So to minimize the total potential energy, you would arrange them as far apart as possible.

But in this case, they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So the minimum potential energy would occur when the mutual repulsion is as small as possible, meaning the charges are as far apart as possible from each other, given their fixed distance from P. So how can that be achieved? If all twelve charges are placed as far apart as possible on the sphere of radius 2m, which would be equally spaced on the surface of a sphere, like the vertices of a regular polyhedron. But calculating the exact distances between each pair in such an arrangement would be complicated, especially with twelve points.

Wait, but maybe in this problem, the mutual potential energy is not considered because each of the twelve is constrained at 2m, but their mutual distances are not given. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the potential energy between each of the twelve and the central charge, and not the potential energy between the twelve themselves.

Wait, the problem says it's an isolated system. So the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energy of each pair. So the pairs are: 1. The central charge with each of the twelve, and 2. Each pair among the twelve.

So we have two contributions to the total potential energy.

But wait, the problem is about finding the minimum energy. So perhaps arranging the twelve charges in such a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized. But if all the twelve are at the same distance from P, but their mutual distances are as large as possible, such as evenly spaced on a sphere, then the mutual potential energy would be the smallest possible. But without knowing the exact distances between each pair, how can I calculate the mutual energy?

Wait, perhaps in this problem, the mutual potential energy is not considered. That is, maybe the only contributions are from the central charge and each of the twelve. Because the twelve are constrained and their positions relative to each other are fixed, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, so perhaps the mutual energy is ignored. But that doesn't seem right because the potential energy between the twelve would be a significant part of the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the twelve are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all the same, but I don't know. Maybe the problem is simplified, and the mutual energy among the twelve is considered as zero or something. But that can't be right. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question says the twelve are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are on a sphere of radius 2m, but their exact positions on the sphere aren't specified. Therefore, without knowing their exact positions, how can I compute the mutual potential energy? Maybe the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, wait. Let me read the problem again. It says, "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the system's energy is minimized when the twelve charges are as far apart as possible from each other, thus minimizing the potential energy between them. But without knowing their exact arrangement, I can't compute that. So perhaps the mutual potential energy isn't considered, and the problem is only about the potential energy between the central charge and each of the twelve.

Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential energy is considered to be zero because the charges are arranged in such a way that they don't contribute to the total energy. But that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that only the potential energies between the central charge and the twelve are considered, and the mutual potential energy among the twelve is zero. But that doesn't seem right, as the mutual energy would definitely contribute. So perhaps the problem expects me to calculate only the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve, and not the mutual energy among the twelve.

Wait, but that would make the problem easier, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The total potential energy U of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for N charges, you have to calculate each possible pair once.

In this case, there are 13 charges. The 13th is at point P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is 2m away from the 13th. So the energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m), correct? Each such pair contributes that energy.

But what about the pairs among the 12 charges? Each pair among them would contribute (k*(2e)*(2e))/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j. But since all the 12 are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances can vary, their mutual potential energies would depend on their arrangement.

But the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps their mutual distances are not fixed, but arranged in a way that the mutual potential energy is minimized. So to minimize the total energy, the mutual potential energies should be as low as possible.

Wait, but wait. Since all the charges are positive, the potential energy between any two is positive. So making them as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy (since U = k q1 q2 / r, and since q1 and q2 are positive, U is positive, so larger r would make U smaller).

So to minimize the total system energy, the mutual potential energies between the twelve charges would be minimized when each pair is as far apart as possible. But without knowing their exact positions, how can I calculate that? Maybe the minimal energy would be achieved when the twelve are equally spaced on a sphere, but the mutual distances are maximized. But without specific information, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero and only considers the central charge's interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the mutual potential energies sum to zero. That seems unlikely, but perhaps the problem doesn't consider them because they're too small or for some other reason.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are on the order of 10^-26 J. Let me think about the magnitude.

Each charge is 2e, so charge q = 2e. e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, so 2e is about 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

The distance from the central charge is 2 meters. So the potential energy between the central charge and each of the twelve is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

Wait, let me compute that. So k is about 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So U for each such pair is (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / (2). Let me compute that.

First, calculate (3.204e-19)^2: that's approximately (3.204)^2 = ~10.27, so 10.27e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 10.27e-38 = approximately 8.988 * 10.27 = ~92.36, so 92.36e-29.

Divide by 2m (which is 2 meters): 92.36e-29 / 2 = ~46.18e-29 J, which is 4.618e-28 J per pair.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, wait a second, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

Wait, the formula is U = k * q1 * q2 / r.

Each pair is between the central charge (q=2e) and one of the twelve (each q=2e). So q1 * q2 = (2e)^2 = 4e².

r is 2 meters.

So U per pair is k * 4e² / (2).

Which simplifies to (k * 4e² ) / 2 = (k * 2e²).

Now, plug in the numbers.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

So 2e² is 2 * 2.566e-38 = 5.132e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 5.132e-38 = ?

Let me compute 8.988e9 * 5.132e-38.

8.988 * 5.132 ≈ 46.19.

So 46.19e9-38 = 46.19e-29 J.

Wait, but wait, the exponents: 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29. So 8.988e9 *5.132e-38 = (8.988 *5.132) * 1e-29.

Which is approximately 46.19 * 1e-29 = 4.619e-28 J per pair.

But wait, wait no: 8.988e9 *5.132e-38 = Let's compute it more accurately.

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

5.132e-38 is 5.132 * 1e-38.

Multiply them: 8.988 *5.132 = approx 46.19.

Then 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 46.19e-29 = 4.619e-28 J. That's the energy for each of the 12 pairs.

So since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy from the central charge and the twelve is 12 * 4.619e-28 J.

12 *4.619e-28 = 55.428e-28 J = 5.5428e-27 J.

But wait, that's only part of the total energy. What about the potential energy between the twelve charges themselves?

Ah, that's the tricky part. The problem is to find the minimum energy, so perhaps the mutual potential energy of the twelve charges should be as small as possible, meaning the charges are arranged as far apart as possible.

But without knowing their exact arrangement, it's hard to compute. Unless the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, which I don't think is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy can be considered as negligible, but that doesn't seem correct because each pair contributes a positive amount.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy of this system." So perhaps when the mutual potential energies are minimized, meaning the charges are as far apart as possible, but how?

Wait, another thought: the mutual potential energy can be zero if the charges are arranged symmetrically, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the twelve charges form a regular icosahedron or something around the central point, but calculating that would require knowing all the mutual distances, which is complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the potential energy due to the central charge and the twelve, and not the mutual potential energies among the twelve. Because without their arrangement, we can't compute it.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are all on the order of 1e-26 or so. Let me see. The calculation I just did was 5.5428e-27 J for the central twelve interactions. The options are A) 5.645e-26, B) 2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D) 122.330.

Hmm, option C is about 7e-27, which is close to the 5.5e-27 I calculated, but not exactly matching. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy among the twelve is considered, and perhaps I should compute that as well.

Wait, if the twelve are arranged in a way that all mutual distances are the same, which would be the case if they're equally spaced on a sphere, but I'm not sure about that. But without knowing the exact distance between each pair, it's tough.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem ignores the mutual potential energy. But why? Because maybe the twelve are fixed in such a way that their mutual distances are at maximum, so the mutual potential energy is zero. No, that's not possible because all charges are positive, so the mutual potential energy is positive.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered, but the problem gives that the twelve are all 2 meters away from P, but their mutual distances are each 4 meters apart. But that can't be right because they're all on a sphere of radius 2 meters. The maximum possible distance between any two points on a sphere of radius 2m is 4 meters (diametrically opposite). But if they were arranged so that every pair is 4 meters apart, that's impossible because you can't have more than two points on a sphere with all pairs diametrically opposite.

So perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered, but the problem doesn't give enough information. Therefore, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not considered in the problem, and the question is only about the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is the same as the sum for each pair, but each pair is at a certain distance. But without knowing their exact positions, it's impossible to compute.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual potential energy is zero because the system is symmetric. But that doesn't make sense because each pair contributes a positive amount.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the minimum energy occurs when the mutual potential energy is as small as possible, which would be when the twelve charges are arranged in such a way that the distance between each pair is as large as possible. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero. Or maybe it's not considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered, but each pair is at the same distance. But without knowing that distance, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential energy is considered, but the problem expects me to find that it's negligible compared to the other term, but the numbers don't support that.

Wait, let's go back. The problem asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is as small as possible, which is when each pair is as far apart as possible. So the minimal mutual potential energy is when the mutual distances are maximized.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve, and not the mutual energy. Because otherwise, the calculation would be too complicated.

So proceeding under that assumption, the total potential energy would be the sum of the energies between the central charge and each of the twelve.

Which I calculated as approximately 5.5428e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is close but higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Each pair between the central charge and the twelve contributes (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2m.

So U = k * (4e²) / (2).

Which simplifies to U = (k * 2 e²) each.

So for each of the 12 pairs, the energy is 2 k e² / 2 = k e².

Wait, no: let's recompute.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate.

Each pair is between the central charge (2e) and one of the twelve (2e), at a distance of 2 m.

So U per pair is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m).

So that's (k *4e²) / (2 m) ) = (2 k e²) / m.

Wait, no, wait: (2e) * (2e) is 4e². Then divided by 2 meters.

So U = (k * 4e²) / 2 = (k * 2 e²) per pair.

So each pair contributes (k * 2 e²) J.

So for 12 pairs, the total is 12 * k * 2 e².

Wait, but that would be 24 k e². Wait, no: for each pair, it's 2 k e².

Wait, let's compute that.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 2 k e² = 2 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute that step by step.

8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 * 2.566 = approx 23.03 (since 8 * 2.566=20.528, 0.988*2.566≈2.537 → total about 23.065).

So 23.065e9-38 = 2.3065e-28 J.

Multiply by 2: 4.613e-28 J per pair.

Wait, no, wait. 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 is 8.988 *2.566 = 23.065, and exponents 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29.

So 23.065e-29 = 2.3065e-28 J.

But wait, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) * 1e9 * 1e-38.

8.988 *2.566 ≈ 23.065.

1e9 *1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 23.065e-29 = 2.3065e-28 J per pair.

But wait, why am I getting conflicting values here?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it more accurately.

Compute k * (2e)^2 / (2m):

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e) = 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.269e-38 C².

Divide by 2m: 10.269e-38 / 2 = 5.1345e-38.

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 5.1345e-38 = ?

8.988 *5.1345 = approximately 46.19 (since 8*5=40, 8*0.1345≈1.076, 0.988*5≈4.94, 0.988*0.1345≈0.133 → total about 46.19). So 46.19e-29 = 4.619e-28 J per pair.

Ah, yes, that's the same as before.

So each pair contributes 4.619e-28 J. Multiply by 12 pairs: 12 *4.619e-28 = 55.428e-28 =5.5428e-27 J.

So about 5.54e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is a bit larger. Hmm. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy among the twelve is also considered. So I need to calculate that as well.

The mutual potential energy would be the sum of (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij for each pair among the twelve.

But without knowing the exact distances r_ij between each pair of the twelve, I can't compute this. However, the problem is asking for the minimum energy, which would occur when the mutual potential energy is as small as possible. Since all charges are positive, the potential energy between any two is positive, so minimal when the charges are as far apart as possible.

But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is taken as zero because the problem considers only the energy between the central charge and the others. Or perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the mutual terms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if I proceed under the assumption that the mutual potential energy is zero, the total energy would be approximately 5.54e-27 J. But that's not one of the options. The closest option is C)7.056e-27 J. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done more accurately. Let's recalculate the energy per pair more precisely.

Compute U per pair:

U = k * (2e)^2 / (2 m)

= (8.988e9) * ( (2 * 1.602e-19 )^2 ) / (2 * 2 )

Wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters, so:

Wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters for each of the twelve to the central charge. So:

U = k * (2e)^2 / (2)

= (8.988e9) * ( (3.204e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2:

3.204^2 = 10.2656, so 10.2656e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 10.2656e-38 = 8.988 *10.2656 = 92.35, and 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 92.35e-29 = 9.235e-28 J.

Divide by 2: 9.235e-28 / 2 = 4.6175e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.6175e-28 *12 = 55.41e-28 =5.541e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 5.54e-27 J. But none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 7.056e-27 J.

Hmm, perhaps the calculation is done with e as 1.6e-19 instead of the precise value.

Let me try using e = 1.6e-19 C for approximation.

So e = 1.6e-19.

Then (2e)^2 = (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

k =8.988e9.

So U = 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 / 2.

= 8.988e9 * 5.12e-38.

= 8.988 *5.12e-29.

8.988 *5.12 ≈ 45.92.

So 45.92e-29 =4.592e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.592e-28 *12 =55.104e-28 =5.5104e-27 J.

Still about 5.51e-27 J. Close to 5.5e-27, but none of the options match that.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.645 x10^-26

B) 2.822 x10^-26

C)7.056 x10^-27

D)122.330

Hmm, option C is about 7e-27, which is about 30% higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each pair is counted twice in the mutual terms, but no, I think I considered each pair once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that each of the twelve contributes not just to the central charge but also to each other, but the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual potential energy because the charges are constrained and thus their mutual distances are fixed, so the mutual energy is a constant and doesn't affect the minimum. But that doesn't make sense because the mutual energy would still be part of the system's energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the total potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the mutual ones, but without knowing their arrangement, it's impossible. So maybe the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions, and the mutual energy is zero.

But that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual energy is considered, but all the twelve charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are each 2m, but that's impossible as they're on a sphere of radius 2m. Wait, the maximum distance between two points on a sphere of radius 2m is 4m, so if they are arranged diametrically opposite, their distance is 4m. But with twelve charges, you can't have all pairs at 4m apart.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2m, but that would require all twelve charges to be at the same point, which isn't allowed because they're constrained to stay 2m from P. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the twelve are arranged in such a way that the distance between any two is 2m as well, but that would require all charges to be on the same point, which isn't possible. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2*sqrt(3) meters or something else, but without knowing, it's impossible to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because all charges are positive.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve, and that's it. So the minimal energy is 5.54e-27 J. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute the energy again with precise values.

Compute (2e)^2: (2 * 1.602176634e-19)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2 = 10.2670457e-38 C².

So U per pair is (8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C²) * (10.2670457e-38 C²) / (2 m).

Compute numerator: 8.9875517879e9 * 10.2670457e-38 = ?

8.9875517879e9 = 8.9875517879 * 1e9.

10.2670457e-38 = 10.2670457 * 1e-38.

Multiply them: 8.9875517879 *10.2670457 ≈ 92.35 (exact: 8.98755 *10.2670457 ≈ 92.35).

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29.

So 92.35e-29 =9.235e-28 J.

Divide by 2 meters: 9.235e-28 /2 = 4.6175e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.6175e-28 *12 =55.41e-28 =5.541e-27 J.

So again, about 5.54e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 7.056e-27 J. But that's still about 25% higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement said 13 charges, each with charge 2e, but the central charge is fixed, so the other twelve are each 2e. So the total is 13 *2e.

Wait, but that doesn't change the calculation because each pair is between 2e and 2e.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses e=1.6e-19, which would lead to a slightly lower value.

Wait, trying with e=1.6e-19:

(2e)=3.2e-19 C.

(2e)^2=10.24e-38 C².

k=8.988e9.

U per pair: (8.988e9 *10.24e-38 ) /2.

= (8.988 *10.24) *1e9 *1e-38 /2.

8.988 *10.24 = approx 92.11.

So 92.11e-29 /2 =46.055e-29 =4.6055e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.6055e-28 *12=55.266e-28=5.5266e-27 J.

Still about 5.53e-27 J.

Hmm. None of the options match this. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times higher than 5.5e-27.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each mutual pair is counted twice? No, because for N charges, the total number of pairs is N choose 2, which is 12 choose 2 =66 pairs among the twelve. But without knowing their mutual distances, I can't compute that.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero, in which case the total is just 5.54e-27 J. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the mutual potential energy between the central charge and the twelve, and not any other terms.

Wait, but the options don't include 5.5e-27. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the central charge is 2e, and the twelve are 2e each, and the potential energy between the central charge and each of the twelve is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2 k e² / m.

Ah, wait, no, because the distance is 2m, so it's 2 k e² / (2m) = k e² / m.

Wait, wait: wait, (2e)*(2e)=4e², divided by 2m gives (4e²)/(2m) = 2e²/m. Then multiply by k.

So U = k * (2 e²) / m.

Wait, that would change the calculation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

U = k * (q1 q2) / r.

For each pair between the central charge (2e) and a surrounding charge (2e), the distance r is 2m.

So U = (k) * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) = (k *4 e²) / (2m) ) = (k * 2 e²) / m.

Wait, no, 4e² divided by 2m is 2e²/m.

So U per pair is (k * 2 e² ) / m.

So for 12 pairs, the total is 12 * (k * 2 e² ) / m.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the energy larger.

Wait, let's recalculate.

U per pair:

= k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m)

= k *4e²/(2m)

= (k * 2 e²) / m.

Hmm, that's different. So each pair contributes (k * 2 e²) / m.

So for 12 pairs, total is 12 * (k * 2 e²) / m.

Wait, but that would make the value much larger. Let's compute that.

Compute (k * 2 e²):

k =8.988e9.

e =1.602e-19.

e²=2.566e-38.

So 2 e² = 5.132e-38.

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 *5.132e-38 = 45.92e-29 =4.592e-28 J.

Divide by m (2 meters): 4.592e-28 /2 = 2.296e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 2.296e-28 *12=27.552e-28=2.7552e-27 J.

So about 2.76e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about ten times larger. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times larger than 2.755e-27.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be U = k*(q1*q2)/r.

So for each of the twelve pairs:

q1 = 2e, q2=2e, r=2m.

So U = (8.988e9) * (2e *2e) / (2).

So that's (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2.

= (8.988e9) * (2 e²).

So U per pair is 8.988e9 * 2 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute that:

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

2 * 2.566e-38 =5.132e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *5.132e-38 = (8.988 *5.132) *1e9 *1e-38.

8.988 *5.132 ≈46.19.

1e9*1e-38=1e-29.

So 46.19e-29 =4.619e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.619e-28 *12 =5.5428e-27 J.

Which brings me back to the initial calculation of ~5.54e-27 J.

So this suggests that the correct energy is approximately 5.54e-27 J. But the options don't have this value.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

A) 5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in including the mutual potential energy. Let's see.

The mutual potential energy among the twelve charges would be the sum of all pairs: 12C2=66 pairs. Each pair would contribute U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, I can't compute it. But the problem is asking for the minimum energy, so perhaps the mutual potential energy is arranged to be as small as possible, which would occur when each r_ij is as large as possible.

So the minimal mutual potential energy is when each r_ij is as large as possible, but without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that these mutual distances are all 2 meters, which is not possible because they are on a sphere of radius 2m.

Wait, no, that's impossible because if all charges are at 2m from P, their mutual distances can't all be 2m. For example, two charges would be at points on the sphere, and their mutual distance would be up to 4m, but others would be closer.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the potential energy due to the central charge and not the mutual potential energy. In that case, the answer would be approximately 5.54e-27 J, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me read it again.

"12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P."

So the 13th is at P, the others are 2m away. So each of the 12 is 2m from P, but their mutual distances vary.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the central charge and each of the twelve, but the mutual energy is neglected. In that case, the correct energy would be ~5.54e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, let me calculate the value with more precise numbers.

Compute U per pair:

k =8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

e =1.602176634e-19 C.

So 2e =3.204353268e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2 =10.2670457e-38 C².

r=2 m.

U = (8.9875517879e9) * 10.2670457e-38 / 2.

= (8.9875517879e9 * 10.2670457e-38) /2.

= (92.35e-29) /2 =46.175e-29 =4.6175e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12:

4.6175e-28 *12 =55.41e-28 =5.541e-27 J.

Hmm. So again, same result.

Looking at the options, the only one in the same ballpark is option C:7.056e-27. That's about 28% higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each of the twelve charges and the central charge, and also each of the twelve charges with the central charge again, which would be double-counting. No, because each pair is only counted once.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the twelve charges interacts with the central charge twice, which would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the central charge is 2e, but the other twelve are each 2e, leading to a total of 13*2e. But that doesn't change the per-pair calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is not among the options, but I have to choose the closest one.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere. Or perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the twelve charges as well, but arranged in a way that the mutual potential energy is 12 times the single pair energy.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the mutual distances vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered to be the same as the central charge's interactions, but that's not correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the system's potential energy is the sum over all pairs, including the mutual ones. So the total is the sum of the central charge's 12 pairs plus the sum of the 66 mutual pairs among the twelve.

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem is assuming that all mutual distances are 2m. But that's impossible because the charges are on a sphere of radius 2m. The maximum possible mutual distance is 4m (diametrically opposite), but other distances would be less. So this approach isn't valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all the same, but again, without knowing their arrangement, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve, and that's it. So the answer is about 5.54e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct option is B) 2.822e-26, but that's an order of magnitude higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct value is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it in a different way. Maybe the potential energy is each of the twelve charges contributing to the central charge, and since the central charge is fixed, only the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve is considered.

So the correct calculation is 5.54e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, which is approximately 1.27 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: perhaps the potential energy is calculated using the formula U = (1/2) * sum over all pairs, but I already accounted for each pair once, so that shouldn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps I was supposed to calculate the work done to bring the charges into place, considering the central charge first. But the central charge is fixed, so perhaps the energy is the sum of bringing each of the twelve charges from infinity to their positions.

But that calculation would be the same as the potential energy I calculated earlier.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. The calculation leads me to approximately 5.54e-27 J, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought. The problem says "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the potential energy is minimized when the mutual potential energy is zero, which is impossible, but maybe the problem is considering that the mutual energy is zero, leaving only the energy between the central charge and the twelve.

So again, the energy is about 5.54e-27 J.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, which is approximately 1.27 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the exact value of e, not an approximation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of (2e)^2. Let me compute it accurately.

e =1.602176634e-19 C.

2e=3.204353268e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2 = (3.204353268)^2 × 1e-38.

3.204353268 squared is approximately 10.2670457.

So 10.2670457e-38 C².

So U per pair is (8.9875517879e9) * (10.2670457e-38) / 2.

Which is (8.9875517879 *10.2670457) *1e9 *1e-38 /2.

8.9875517879 *10.2670457 = 92.35.

1e9 *1e-38=1e-29.

So 92.35e-29 /2=46.175e-29=4.6175e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.6175e-28 *12=55.41e-28=5.541e-27 J.

Again, same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the central charge is also interacting with the mutual pairs, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (k q^2)/(2r) for each charge, but that would change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula is U = (k q^2)/(2r) for each charge, so the total is (12 * (k*(2e)^2))/(2*2m).

Wait, let's compute that.

(12 * (k*(4e²)) ) / (4m).

Which simplifies to (12 *4 k e² )/(4m) )= (12 k e²)/m.

Compute that:

k=8.988e9.

e²=2.566e-38.

So 12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 / 2 meters.

Wait, no, the formula is (12 *4 k e² )/(4m) )= (12 k e²)/m.

So 12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 / 2.

Wait, no, (12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38) /2.

Wait, (12 *8.988e9) = 107.856e9.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 107.856e9 *2.566e-38 = 276.9e-29.

Divide by 2: 138.45e-29=1.3845e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 1.38e-27 J, which is close to option C's 7.056e-27, but not quite.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (k q^2)/(r) for each charge, but I think the correct formula is U = k q1 q2 / r for each pair.

Another idea: perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy in terms of the work done to assemble the charges, which would include the mutual terms.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions and the mutual terms are neglected, in which case the answer is ~5.54e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J. But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant. For example, using k=9e9 instead of the precise 8.988e9.

Let me try that.

k=9e9.

Then U per pair is (9e9 * (2e)^2 )/(2m).

(2e)^2= (3.204e-19)^2=10.269e-38 C².

So U = (9e9 *10.269e-38 ) / 2.

= (9.2421e-29) /2 =4.621e-29 J per pair.

Wait, no, wait:

9e9 *10.269e-38 =9.2421e-29.

Divide by 2: 4.621e-29 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 55.452e-29=5.5452e-28 J.

Wait, that's 5.545e-28 J, which is about 5.545e-28 J, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the options.

Hmm. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each pair of the twelve as if they're all at 2m apart, which isn't possible, but let's proceed.

So each mutual pair among the twelve has r=2m.

So each mutual pair contributes U =k*(2e)^2/(2m) = same as the central charge pairs.

So each mutual pair contributes 4.6175e-28 J.

Number of mutual pairs: 12C2=66.

So mutual energy is 66 *4.6175e-28 = 66 *4.6175e-28 ≈304.485e-28=3.04485e-26 J.

Adding the central charge's 5.541e-27 J, total is approximately 3.04485e-26 +5.541e-27=3.599e-26 J.

Which is around 3.6e-26 J. The closest option is A)5.645e-26, which is higher.

But this would only be valid if all mutual distances are 2m, which isn't possible because the twelve charges are on a sphere of radius 2m. So the mutual distances can't all be 2m.

So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. The only conclusion I can draw is that the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I can't see why that would be the case based on my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each of the twelve charges and the central charge, but each charge is being counted twice. For example, each pair is counted once for the central charge and once for the mutual terms. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each charge and the central charge, and then multiplying by the number of charges, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (1/2) * sum (k q_i q_j / r_ij ), which would affect the calculation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the central charge and one of the twelve, not all twelve. But that would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the energy in electronvolts rather than joules, but that's not the case because the options are in joules.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The closest option to my calculation is not present, but perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J.


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The total potential energy of the system arises from two contributions: the potential energy between the central charge and each of the twelve charges, and the mutual potential energy among the twelve charges. However, the mutual potential energy is not explicitly calculated due to the lack of information about the exact arrangement of the twelve charges, which would determine their mutual distances.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Between the Central Charge and the Twelve Charges**:
   - Each pair between the central charge (\( 2e \)) and one of the twelve charges (\( 2e \)) contributes to the potential energy. The formula for the potential energy between two charges is:
     \[
     U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
     \]
     where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).
   - Substituting \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), the potential energy per pair is:
     \[
     U = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2e)^2}{2} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (3.204 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2}
     \]
     Simplifying, \( (2e)^2 = 10.269 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \), so:
     \[
     U = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (10.269 \times 10^{-38})}{2} = 4.6175 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - Since there are 12 such pairs, the total contribution from the central charge is:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot 4.6175 \times 10^{-28} = 5.541 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Mutual Potential Energy Among the Twelve Charges**:
   - The mutual potential energy depends on the distances between the twelve charges, which are constrained to lie on a sphere of radius 2 meters. Without knowing their exact arrangement, the mutual distances cannot be determined, and thus the mutual potential energy cannot be calculated. However, the problem asks for the minimum energy, which implies the mutual potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible.

3. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated potential energy from the central charge and the twelve charges is approximately \( 5.541 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). However, this value does not match any of the given options.
   - Among the options, the closest value to the calculated result is **Option C: \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**. This discrepancy could arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the given options, the most reasonable choice is **Option C**, as it is the closest to the computed value of \( 5.541 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \), despite the lack of explicit consideration for the mutual potential energy.

Answer: C
