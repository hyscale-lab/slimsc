Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's think through this step by step. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, excited in a specific energy level—so I'm guessing this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, right? Because that's what explains the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium, which is what LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) implies.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that number looks familiar. 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta E = k_B * something. But wait, delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k_B * 1 K, because k_B is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta E equals k_B * T, but wait, not exactly. Because delta E is the energy gap between levels, and the probability of excitation depends on the exponential of delta E over k_B T. Right, the Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-delta_E/(k_B T)) for the ratio of populations in two states.

So the ratio of excitation (say, N2/N1) is proportional to exp(-delta_E/(k_B T)), where N2 is the number in the higher energy level and N1 in the lower. But wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I'm assuming that the excitation level is the ratio N2/(N1 + N2) or something like that. Wait no, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited"—maybe it's the ratio of the excited state population relative to the ground state. Or perhaps the ratio of the two stars' excitation levels.

Wait, let me rephrase. For each star, the number of iron atoms in the excited state compared to the ground state would be given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the ratio N1_excited/N1_ground = (g2/g1) * exp(-delta_E/(k_B T1)), and similarly for star_2, N2_excited/N2_ground = (g2/g1) * exp(-delta_E/(k_B T2)).

But wait, the problem states that for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So maybe (N1_excited/N1_total) is twice (N2_excited/N2_total)? Or perhaps it's the ratio of the populations. Wait, it's a bit ambiguous, but I think the question is referring to the ratio of the number of excited atoms to the total atoms. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the excitation levels, like N2/N1 for each star, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply talking about the excitation being twice as much—so the ratio of the excitation in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1.

Wait, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe for each atom, the excitation energy is twice as much? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, it's the number of excited atoms—like the fraction of iron atoms in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

So let's model it. Let's let x be the fraction of excited atoms in star_2, so in star_1, the fraction is 2x. Then, using the Boltzmann factor:

For star_2:

x = (g2/g1) exp( -delta_E/(k_B T2) )

For star_1:

2x = (g2/g1) exp( -delta_E/(k_B T1) )

Hmm, but wait, unless the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same, which I think they are for the same transition. So the ratio would be (2x/x) = [exp(-delta_E/(k_B T1))] / [exp(-delta_E/(k_B T2))]

So 2 = exp( delta_E/(k_B) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, because when you take the ratio, the exponents subtract. Let me make that clear.

Let me write it as:

(2x)/x = [ (g2/g1 exp(-delta_E/(k_B T1)) ) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp(-delta_E/(k_B T2)) ) ]

Which simplifies to 2 = exp( delta_E/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because when you divide the two exponents, you subtract the exponents: (-delta_E/(k_B T1)) - (-delta_E/(k_B T2)) ) = delta_E/(k_B) ( -1/T1 + 1/T2 ) = delta_E/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So:

2 = exp( (delta_E/(k_B)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(2) = (delta_E/(k_B)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But wait, delta_E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k_B * 1 K. Because k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K, so delta_E = k_B * T, where T is 1 K. So delta_E = k_B * 1 K.

So substituting delta_E = k_B * 1 K into the equation:

ln(2) = (k_B * 1 K)/(k_B) ) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

The k_B cancels:

ln(2) = (1 K) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

We can rewrite this as:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Hmm, let's rearrange terms:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, because let's see:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ). So that would be the correct equation.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let's double-check the setup. The fraction of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So N1_excited/N1_total = 2 (N2_excited/N2_total )

Assuming that the statistical weights are same, so g cancels in the ratio.

So the ratio is:

(N1_excited/N1_total) / (N2_excited/N2_total) ) = 2

Which is:

[ (g2 exp(-E/(k T1 )) ) / (g1 + g2 exp(-E/(k T1 )) ) ] / [ (g2 exp(-E/(k T2 )) ) / (g1 + g2 exp(-E/(k T2 )) ) ) ] = 2

But if E is small compared to k*T, then the denominator can be approximated as 1, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps in stars, the excitation is often such that the denominator is large, so the fraction is roughly proportional to exp(-delta_E/(k T)).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that both stars have the same g1 and g2, and that the fraction is N2/N1, but perhaps the ratio is given as 2. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is N1
