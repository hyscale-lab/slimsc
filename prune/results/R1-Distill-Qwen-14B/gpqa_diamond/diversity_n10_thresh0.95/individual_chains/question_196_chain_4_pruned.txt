Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. Oh wait, and the speed of light is c. The options are A to D, and I need to pick which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that in non-relativistic mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh, that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are different.

In relativity, energy isn't just kinetic; we have to consider the total energy including relativistic effects. So maybe the energy approach used in the non-relativistic case isn't directly applicable. Let me think about the energy in special relativity.

In special relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does this apply to the oscillator?

Wait, the oscillator is subject to Hooke's law, F = -kx, which is a conservative force. So the potential energy should be U = (1/2)kx². But in relativity, is the kinetic energy still (gamma - 1)mc²? Because in relativity, the energy isn't just (1/2)mv².

Hmm, so maybe the total mechanical energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy (kinetic + potential) is constant, but in the relativistic case, the expressions change.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's energy is quantized, but no, the question seems to be about the classical case.

Wait, let's model the oscillator. The equation of motion would then be relativistic. Normally, for a harmonic oscillator, the equation is m d²x/dt² = -kx. But relativistically, perhaps the momentum term is gamma m v, so the equation becomes more complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of energy.

At maximum amplitude A, the velocity is zero. The potential energy is at maximum, U = (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA².

Wait, but in relativity, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, and when it's at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So maybe E is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy at x=0.

But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². So equating E = (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1)mc².

Wait, let me write that equation: (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc². Solving for gamma.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc² → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that would give gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Hmm, but as A increases, this gamma gets larger. But wait, this might not be the case because when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude, its velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, but the potential is maximum.

Wait, no, actually, in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA², and all of that goes into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So in the relativistic case, the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which is now the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, no. Wait, the rest mass energy is mc². So the total energy when the oscillator is at x=A (max displacement) is E = U + K. But K is zero there, so E = U = (1/2)kA². But in reality, the total energy should include the rest mass energy plus kinetic and potential. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the total mechanical energy in the system is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is not (1/2)mv², but (gamma -1)mc². So perhaps the total energy E is (gamma -1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

But at maximum displacement, x = A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc², but wait, gamma would be 1 when v=0, so (gamma -1) would be zero. That can't be right because the potential energy is (1/2)kA², so E must be mc² plus (1/2)kA²?

Hmm, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let's consider the total energy E of the oscillator. At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)k A² + mc²? Wait, no, because the rest mass energy is mc². So when the oscillator is at x=A, its potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So total energy E would be (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or is the rest energy part of the total energy, so maybe E is (1/2)kA² + kinetic energy?

Wait, no, perhaps I should model E as the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, plus potential. Or maybe the total energy is the sum of the rest energy, kinetic, and potential. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's think clearly. In a classical harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is E = (1/2)kA². That's the sum of kinetic and potential energy when the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0). So when x=0, all energy is kinetic (1/2)mv². When x=A, all energy is potential (1/2)kA².

In the relativistic case, the energy expressions change. The potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So the total mechanical energy is (gamma -1) mc² + (1/2)k x².

At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². Wait, but when velocity is zero, gamma is 1, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E would be (1/2)kA². But that can't be right because E should also include the rest energy? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts.

Wait, no. The rest energy is mc², which is part of the total energy. So when the oscillator is at x=A, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy, kinetic energy (which is zero), and potential energy (1/2 kA²). So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA². So perhaps the rest energy is already included, and E is just the sum of kinetic and potential. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Because when x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so E is mc² + (1/2)kA².

At equilibrium (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so E is the sum of kinetic energy and rest energy. So E = (gamma -1) mc² + mc² = gamma mc².

Wait, that would mean that mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

So, (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, so gamma is 1 plus that term. Then, from gamma, we can find v_max.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me compute gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) → Let's call this term (k A²)/(2 m c²) as something. Let me call it 'a' for simplicity. So gamma = 1 + a.

Then, 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ) = 1 + a.

Squaring both sides:

1/(1 - (v²/c²)) = (1 + a)^2 → 1/(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + 2a + a².

Taking reciprocal on both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + 2a + a²).

So, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + 2a + a²)].

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe I should solve for v in terms of a.

Alternatively, let's rearrange the equation gamma = 1 + a, where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma = 1 + a.

Then, gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

Squaring both sides, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Compute 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2:

= [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expand numerator: (1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a².

So, v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator: a(2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's plug that back in:

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(2m c²)) (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Hmm, this is getting messy. Maybe I can simplify this expression.

Let me factor out (k A²)/(2 m c²) from the numerator.

Wait, numerator is (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ].

Denominator is [ 1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ]^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^
