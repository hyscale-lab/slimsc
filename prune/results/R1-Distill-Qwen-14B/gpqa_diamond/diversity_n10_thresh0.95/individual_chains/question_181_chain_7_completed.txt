Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch of reactions in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are as usual. We need to find the ratio of the neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux band1 divided by flux band2.

First, I remember that the pp chain is a major source of solar energy. The pp-III branch is part of this chain, which involves reactions leading to helium production. Neutrinos are produced in these reactions, mainly electron neutrinos (νe).

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? Oh right, the proton-proton chain has a few steps. The pp-I branch is the initial part where two protons fuse into deuterium, and so on. The pp-II and pp-III branches come into play when there's a helium-3 involved. The pp-III branch is the one where two He-3 nuclei fuse to form He-4, which produces two protons and two neutrinos. So, each He-3 fusion in the pp-III branch releases two νe.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of these neutrinos would stop. But wait, what about other sources of neutrinos? I think the main neutrino sources in the Sun are the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos too, but maybe less? Or maybe the same type?

Wait, the CNO cycle is another hydrogen burning process, and it also produces neutrinos, mainly νe as well. So, if only the pp-III branch stops, other parts of the pp chain and the CNO cycle would still contribute neutrinos.

So, the question is about the flux ratio of two specific energy bands. Let me think about the neutrino energies produced by different reactions.

In the proton-proton chain, the neutrinos are produced in the pp-I and pp-III branches. The pp-I branch (like the initial steps) produces lower energy neutrinos, maybe around 0.4 MeV or less. The pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos, around a few MeV. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact energies. Let me think again. Oh, right, the neutrino energy from the pp-III branch is about 1.4 MeV each (since each He-3 fusion produces two neutrinos of ~1.4 MeV each). So, the neutrinos from pp-III are in the higher energy range, say around 1.4 MeV each.

But wait, neutrino energies from different reactions—like in the CNO cycle—are generally higher. The CNO neutrinos are typically higher energy than the pp chain ones. Because in the CNO cycle, carbon is involved, and the reactions involve higher mass nuclei, so the neutrinos emitted have higher energies. So, CNO neutrinos are typically in the range of a few MeV.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the main source of higher-energy neutrinos from the pp chain is gone. But the CNO neutrinos are still being produced.

So, the flux from the pp-III branch is a significant fraction of the total solar neutrino flux. I think the pp chain contributes about 90% of the Sun's neutrinos, and the CNO cycle about 10%. But I might have that backwards. Wait, no, I think the pp chain is the dominant one, producing most neutrinos, but the CNO cycle produces high-energy neutrinos.

Wait, the Sun's overall neutrino flux peaks in the 0.5-5 MeV range. The majority comes from the proton-proton chain. The main neutrino line from the pp chain is around 0.4 MeV. The CNO neutrinos have a higher average energy, around 3-10 MeV.

But in the pp-III branch, each neutrino is about 1.4 MeV. So if the pp-III branch stops, then the main source of around 1.4 MeV neutrinos stops. But the CNO cycle is still producing higher-energy neutrinos.

So, the question is about two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Wait, 1 MeV is 1000 keV. So, 700-800 keV is 0.7-0.8 MeV, and 800-900 is 0.8-0.9 MeV.

Hmm, so neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range are lower energy. The main pp neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV, but there might be other contributions. Are there any neutrinos from the pp chain above 0.4 MeV? The pp-III branch gives 1.4 MeV, but if that's stopped, what else contributes to neutrinos around 0.7 MeV?

Wait, could the other parts of the pp chain, like the pp-I and pp-II branches, contribute? Let me think. The standard pp chain is pp-I, where two protons collide to form deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3, and so on. The neutrinos in the pp-I branch are the ones in the 0.4 MeV region. The pp-III branch, which is a side branch where two He-3 nuclei fuse to form He-4, produces two νe each of ~1.4 MeV.

Wait, so if the pp-III stops, then the 1.4 MeV neutrinos stop, but the CNO cycle's neutrinos are around higher energies. So, the neutrino flux in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range would be from other sources. But wait, the pp chain's main neutrinos are at 0.4 MeV, so how do we get neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the neutrinos from the decaying of some other particles, but I don't think so. So perhaps the main source for neutrinos in the band 0.7-0.8 is the pp-III branch? No, the pp-III is at 1.4 MeV. Hmm, maybe the question is considering the neutrinos from the CNO cycle and the pp chain's other branches.

Wait a minute, perhaps the pp chain has a neutrino emission at about 0.4 MeV (pp-I), and the pp-III is at 1.4 MeV. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, like around 3-4 MeV. So, the 0.7-0.8 MeV band would be in between.

Is there another source of neutrinos in the Sun that would contribute to this range? Hmm. Maybe the boron neutrinos? Wait, like in the CNO cycle, boron-11 captures a proton to become carbon-12, which then beta decays into nitrogen-12, emitting a neutrino. The neutrino energy from that is about 15.5 MeV? No, that's way higher. Wait, no, I think the CNO cycle produces a neutrino in a reaction where boron-11 captures a proton to become carbon-12, and then it beta decays to nitrogen-12, releasing a neutrino. The neutrino energy from that is about 15.5 MeV. That's way higher than the bands we're considering.

So, maybe the CNO neutrinos are not contributing to the 0.7-0.8 MeV range. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, which produces neutrinos at 1.4 MeV, then the flux at higher energies (like 0.8-0.9 MeV, band 2) would decrease, but what about band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV)?

Wait, if the pp-III branch was the main source in band 2, then if it stops, band 2's flux would drop. But what about band 1? If band 1 is from, say, the pp-I branch, which is around 0.4 MeV. But 0.7 MeV is higher than that. So perhaps there's another source.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the neutrino energy spectrum from the Sun. The main neutrino lines are from the dominant reactions. The pp chain produces a broad spectrum, but the main line is around 0.4 MeV. The CNO cycle produces a broad spectrum but with higher average energies, so maybe 3 MeV on average.

But the question is about two specific bands, 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV. So, both of these are lower than the 1.4 MeV from pp-III, but higher than the 0.4 MeV from pp-I.

Wait, could there be other neutrino production processes in the Sun that would emit in that range? Maybe the so-called 'hep' process (hydrogen burning via the proton-electron process), but I think that's a minor contributor. Or perhaps the neutrinos from other isotopes.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when the pp-III branch stops, the production of the 1.4 MeV neutrinos ceases, but the CNO neutrinos are still present. So, the 0.7-0.8 MeV band (band 1) would have a certain flux, and the 0.8-0.9 MeV (band 2) would have a much lower flux because that's near the 1.4 MeV peak.

Wait, but that might not directly make sense. Let me think again.

The pp-III branch produces neutrinos around 1.4 MeV. So, if it stops, the neutrino flux around 1.4 MeV would drop. But the bands in question are 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV. So, if the pp-III is the only source emitting around 1.4 MeV, stopping it would affect higher energy bands, not lower ones.

Hmm. So, perhaps the neutrino flux in band 1 (0.7-0.8) is mainly from the pp chain, while band 2 (0.8-0.9) is from the CNO cycle. Or wait, maybe the CNO neutrinos are in higher energy bands, so band 2 would be part of the CNO flux.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, the CNO neutrinos are still there. So, the flux in band 2 would be similar to what it was before, but the flux in band 1 is from the pp chain's other branches.

Wait, no. The CNO neutrinos are higher energy, so their flux in band 1 (0.7-0.8) might not be significant. So, if the pp-III stops, which produces 1.4 MeV neutrinos, the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9) would decrease because those neutrinos were part of the pp-III flux. Wait, but 1.4 MeV is outside of both bands. So, perhaps the pp-III contributes to the 1.4 MeV region, which is higher than both bands.

Then, if the pp-III stops, the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV bands would still be from the other sources, like the pp-I and CNO.

Wait, but the pp-I produces around 0.4 MeV, so maybe the flux in the 0.7-0.8 band is negligible from the pp chain. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. If the pp-III branch is stopped, but the CNO is still producing neutrinos, then the flux in the higher energy bands would depend on the CNO. But the question is about the ratio between two lower energy bands, both below the pp-III neutrino energy.

Wait, perhaps without the pp-III branch, the total neutrino flux from the pp chain would decrease. Since the pp-III branch is a major contributor, stopping it would significantly reduce the total flux. But the CNO cycle is only a minor part of the total neutrino production, perhaps.

Wait, I think the pp chain accounts for about 99% of the Sun's neutrino production, and the CNO cycle about 1%. So, if the pp-III branch contributes a significant fraction of the pp neutrinos, stopping it would reduce the total flux.

But in this question, the pp-III is stopped. So, the total pp flux would go down.

But the neutrino energies from CNO are higher, so in the 0.7-0.8 MeV band, the neutrino flux would be mainly from the pp chain, but if the pp-III is stopped, which produces higher energy neutrinos, then the lower energy bands (like 0.7 MeV) would have less contribution? Or maybe the same.

Wait, the pp-III neutrinos are at 1.4 MeV, so the bands in question (0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9) are in the lower end of the neutrino spectrum. So, if the pp-III stops, which doesn't affect these lower bands, then the ratio between the two bands would remain the same as before.

But wait, are there any other factors? The question says that the pp-III has stopped, so all other reactions remain the same. So, the pp-I and pp-II branches are still active, and the CNO cycle is still active.

So, the neutrino flux in band 1 (0.7-0.8) comes mainly from the pp-I branch (0.4 MeV), and perhaps some from other sources. The flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9) would be from higher-energy contributions, but if the pp-III stopped, which is at 1.4 MeV, which is higher than both bands, maybe band 2's flux is unaffected.

Wait, but 0.8-0.9 is close to 1.4 MeV? No, 1.4 is higher. So, the pp-III neutrinos are not in band 2 either. So, what's the source of neutrinos in band 2?

Alternatively, maybe band 2 is part of the pp-III neutrino spectrum. But each pp-III reaction emits two neutrinos each of ~1.4 MeV. So, the neutrinos from pp-III are around 1.4, which is outside of both bands. So, the flux in both bands would be from other sources.

Wait, maybe the pp-I produces some spread of energies. The pp-I main line is at about 0.4 MeV, but maybe there are some higher energy neutrinos from other processes.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the relative contributions of the pp-III and CNO neutrinos above a certain threshold. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the fact that the pp-III branch produces a significant number of neutrinos in the higher energy range, and without them, the higher energy bands (like band 2) would have a lower flux compared to band 1.

But the bands are 0.7-0.8 (band 1) and 0.8-0.9 (band 2). So, band 2 is a little higher than band 1.

In the Sun, the pp chain produces a broad spectrum, with the majority of neutrinos around 0.4 MeV, but there might be a tail extending to higher energies. Similarly, the CNO cycle's neutrinos have a higher average energy.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, which produces the higher-energy neutrinos in the pp chain, then the flux at higher energies (like band 2) would decrease more than the lower energies (band 1), which are still dominated by the pp-I and CNO.

Wait, but the CNO neutrinos are higher energy, so in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, their contribution would be minimal. So, band 1 is dominated by the pp chain (pp-I and pp-II). Band 2 is perhaps a mix of the pp chain's higher tail and the start of the CNO contributions.

But without pp-III, which is higher, perhaps the pp chain's flux in band 2 is lower, but the CNO's flux in band 2 would remain the same.

Wait, but the CNO cycle's neutrinos are much higher, so their flux in band 2 would be negligible. So, the flux in band 2 would primarily depend on the pp chain's higher-energy neutrinos.

If the pp-III stopped, then the higher-energy neutrinos from the pp chain (like 1.4 MeV) are gone, so the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) would have less contribution from the pp chain. But if the pp chain's main neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV, maybe the tail extends up to 1 MeV or so. So, without the pp-III, the tail would be less.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is a major contributor to the 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV bands. No, wait, the pp-III neutrinos are 1.4 MeV, which is higher than both bands. So, if pp-III stops, the flux in those bands would be unaffected. But that can't be the case because the question is about the ratio changing.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the neutrino burst from the pp-III branch. So, when the pp-III stops, the neutrino flux from that part would stop. But pp-III is responsible for a certain part of the high-energy neutrinos, which are higher than both bands.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the neutrino production. In the Sun, the main sources of neutrinos are:

1. Proton-proton chain (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III), which contributes lower energy neutrinos, mainly around 0.4 MeV (pp-I) and 1.4 MeV (pp-III).
2. CNO cycle, which contributes higher energy neutrinos, around 3-4 MeV.

So, the neutrino flux in the 0.7-0.8 MeV (band 1) is mainly from the pp chain, but perhaps the pp-III contributes to higher energies beyond that. If the pp-III stops, then the higher energy neutrinos from the pp chain are gone, but the lower energies (like band 1) are still present.

Wait, but the pp-III neutrinos are at 1.4 MeV, which is way above the bands in question. So, if the pp-III stops, the flux in the 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV bands would remain the same as before, because the pp-III doesn't contribute to these bands. Thus, the ratio would remain 1.

But that would mean the answer is C) 1. But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the pp-III is a major contributor to the high-energy neutrinos, which would have a tail towards the 0.7-0.8 MeV range. Without it, the higher bands would have less flux.

Wait, perhaps the pp chain has a broad spectrum. The pp-I produces at 0.4 MeV, but maybe there are some contributions from other processes, like the so-called 'dip' or other reactions, that emit neutrinos with higher energies, possibly contributing to the 0.7-0.8 MeV range.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is not the only contributor to higher energies. So, if the pp-III stops, the flux in the 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV bands would decrease.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach. The question says that the pp-III branch stopped, and we need the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2.

If the pp-III was a source of neutrinos in band 2, then without it, band 2's flux would drop more than band 1. But if the pp-III neutrinos are at 1.4 MeV, which is higher than both bands, then perhaps their flux in both bands is zero, so the ratio remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the pp-III branch is the primary contributor to the higher-energy neutrinos, and without it, the higher-energy bands have less flux compared to lower ones.

Wait, perhaps the neutrino flux is higher in the higher energy bands when the pp-III is active. So, without it, the higher energy bands (like band 2) would have less flux compared to band 1, making the ratio higher.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 10.

B) 0.01.

C) 1.

D) 0.1.

So, the ratio is flux (band1) over flux (band2).

If the pp-III stopped, and pp-III was contributing more to band 2 than band 1, then the flux in band 2 would drop, making the ratio higher (since band1 is same and band2 is lower).

If band2's flux drops more than band1's, flux band1/flux band2 would increase. For example, if band1 was 10 and band2 was 1, the ratio would be 10 (option A). Or if band1 is 1 and band2 is 0.1, the ratio is 10.

But if the pp-III neutrinos are at 1.4 MeV, which is higher than both bands, then perhaps stopping the pp-III would not affect bands 1 and 2. So their flux ratio remains same as before, which is 1. So, the answer would be C.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: the pp chain's neutrinos are lower energy, and the CNO are higher. If the pp-III stops, which produces higher-energy neutrinos, then the overall high-energy flux (like band2) would decrease, but band1 (lower energy) remains roughly the same.

So, the flux in band1 is mainly from the pp chain (pp-I and others), and the flux in band2 would have contributions from the pp chain's higher-energy emissions (pp-III) and perhaps the CNO. But since the CNO neutrinos are higher, they contribute less to band2. So, without pp-III, band2's flux decreases more than band1's. So, the ratio (band1/band2) would increase.

But the CNO neutrinos are at higher energies. So, in the 0.8-0.9 MeV band, their contribution is negligible. Therefore, the flux in band2 is mainly from the pp chain's higher-energy neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III stops, and the pp-III is the main source of neutrinos in band2, then the flux in band2 would drop significantly. The flux in band1 would remain roughly the same.

So, in that case, the ratio (band1/band2) would increase. Suppose before the pp-III stopped, the ratio was about 1. After stopping, band2's flux drops, so the ratio goes up.

But if the pp-III neutrinos are at 1.4 MeV, which is higher than 0.9 MeV, then the pp-III neutrinos are not contributing to band2. So, why would the ratio change?

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the neutrino energies. Let me double-check.

The standard pp chain:

- pp-I: produces a neutrino of around 0.4 MeV.
- pp-II and pp-III: pp-II leads to production of He-3, and pp-III is two He-3 fusing into He-4, which emits two neutrinos, each about 1.4 MeV.

CNO cycle: the neutrinos have energies around 14-15 MeV (like in the case of 13C neutrinos) and around 3-4 MeV (from 15O).

Wait, wait, no. The CNO cycle has two main neutrino emission points. One is in the 13C(beta+ decay) which emits a neutrino around 15.5 MeV. Another is the 15O decay, which emits a neutrino around 3-4 MeV.

So, the CNO neutrinos have a much higher energy. So, in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, the CNO neutrinos are not contributing. So, band1 would be dominated by the pp chain's lower-energy neutrinos, and band2 would be dominated by the pp chain's higher-energy neutrinos, but the pp-III is at 1.4 MeV, which is higher than both bands.

So, the flux in band2 (0.8-0.9) would have contributions from the pp chain's higher-energy neutrinos, but not the pp-III. Because the pp-III is at higher energy.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think about the neutrino energy spectrum. The pp chain produces a broad spectrum, but the main peak is around 0.4 MeV, and there's a tail extending up to about 1.4 MeV. The CNO neutrinos start around 3 MeV and go higher.

So, in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, the flux comes mainly from the pp chain's high-energy tail. Similarly, the 0.8-0.9 MeV band would have more of the pp chain's tail.

If the pp-III branch stopped, which is at 1.4 MeV, would that affect the flux in the 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 bands? Probably not directly, because the pp-III neutrinos are at higher energies. But perhaps the pp-III is a major contributor to the high-energy part of the pp chain's spectrum, so the tail from 0.4 MeV to 1.4 MeV would have a significant drop in flux above a certain point.

But the bands in question are at 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9, which are below 1.4. So, the pp-III stopping might not directly affect these bands. Hence, the flux in these bands would remain the same, making the ratio 1.

But wait, if the pp-III is a major contributor to the overall pp neutrino flux, stopping it would reduce the total flux from the pp chain. But the lower energy bands (like 0.7-0.8) are more affected by the main pp-I neutrinos, which are still active. So, the lower band's flux would decrease less than the higher bands, but in this case, the higher bands are above 0.9 MeV, which is beyond our question.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The initial question is about the ratio when the pp-III stops. So, the pp-III is responsible for higher-energy neutrinos (1.4 MeV), which are outside the given bands. Therefore, the flux in bands 1 and 2 would be unaffected because they are in lower energy ranges. Thus, the ratio remains the same as before.

But what was the ratio before? Well, the neutrino spectrum from the pp chain has a peak at 0.4 MeV, and it decreases towards higher energies. So, the flux is higher at lower energies. Therefore, band1 (0.7-0.8) would have less flux than band2 (0.8-0.9) if the spectrum is falling off. Wait, no, wait, the flux peaks at 0.4 MeV, so the flux decreases as energy increases. So, band1 (0.7-0.8) would have lower flux than band2 (0.8-0.9) if the spectrum is falling. But wait, no, because the spectrum is higher at lower energies. So, the flux in band1 would be lower than band2? No, I'm getting confused about the shape of the spectrum.

Wait, no. The higher energy bands would have lower flux because the spectrum drops off at higher energies. So, band1 (0.7-0.8) would have a higher flux than band2 (0.8-0.9)? Or lower?

Wait, the neutrino flux is highest around 0.4 MeV, so as energy increases from 0.4 MeV, the flux decreases. So, in band1 (0.7-0.8), the flux is lower than the peak, but band2 (0.8-0.9) is even higher, so the flux is lower than band1.

Wait, no. Let me think of it as a distribution. The flux is highest at 0.4 MeV, and it decreases as you move to higher energies. So, the flux at 0.7 MeV is lower than at 0.4 MeV, and at 0.8 MeV even lower. So, the flux in band1 (0.7-0.8) would be less than the flux in band2 (0.8-0.9) because band2 is at a higher energy, where the flux is even lower. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because from 0.7 to 0.8, the flux is decreasing, and from 0.8 to 0.9, it continues to decrease. So, band1 is higher in flux than band2.

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: the flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second in each energy band. The distribution peaks at 0.4 MeV, so the flux in the 0.4-0.5 MeV band is higher than 0.5-0.6, which is higher than 0.6-0.7, and so on. So, band1 (0.7-0.8) would have lower flux than band2 (0.8-0.9) if band2 were at a lower energy. But wait, no, band2 is higher in energy. So, the flux in band2 is lower than band1.

Wait, no, no. Because the flux decreases with increasing energy. So, band1 (0.7-0.8) is higher in energy than band2 (0.8-0.9). Wait, no, 0.7-0.8 is lower than 0.8-0.9. So, the flux in band1 is higher than band2. Because the flux is higher at lower energies.

So, the ratio of flux1 to flux2 would be greater than 1.

Wait, but if the pp-III stopped, which emits at 1.4 MeV, which is higher than both bands, then the flux in both bands remains the same as before, so the ratio is the same as before.

But what is the ratio before the pp-III stopped? The neutrino flux from the pp chain is higher at lower energies, so the ratio of band1 to band2 would be (flux in 0.7-0.8) / (flux in 0.8-0.9). Since the flux decreases with energy, band1 has higher flux than band2. So, the ratio would be greater than 1.

But wait, the CNO neutrinos are in higher energies, so they don't contribute to these bands. So, both bands are dominated by the pp chain.

In that case, the ratio of band1 to band2 would be greater than 1 because, as you go to higher energies, the flux decreases. So, band1 (lower energy) has higher flux than band2 (higher energy).

But without the pp-III, does that change the flux in these bands? If the pp-III is a major contributor to the high-energy tail, stopping it would reduce the number of neutrinos in the higher energy parts of the pp chain's spectrum, which would affect the higher energy bands beyond a certain point. But in our case, both bands are below 1 MeV, so the pp-III stopping might not directly affect them.

Wait, but the pp-III is responsible for a significant fraction of the pp chain's neutrinos. If it stops, the total pp neutrino flux would decrease. But the lower energy bands (like 0.7-0.8) are dominated by the pp-I neutrinos. So, the total neutrino flux would decrease, but the relative ratio between band1 and band2 could stay the same if the pp-III only affects higher energy neutrinos beyond 1 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is the main source of the high-energy neutrinos, so without it, the high-energy parts of the pp chain's spectrum (like 1.4 MeV) would drop, but the lower energy parts (like 0.4 MeV) would remain. So, the ratio of band1 to band2 would remain the same.

But I'm not seeing any significant change in the ratio because the bands are below the pp-III neutrino energy.

So, in that case, the flux ratio remains the same, so the answer is C) 1.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: think of the neutrino flux as a function of energy. The pp chain produces a spectrum that's highest around 0.4 MeV and decreases at higher energies. The CNO cycle contributes a higher-energy tail. If the pp-III branch stops, the high-energy part of the pp chain's spectrum is reduced, but the lower energies (like 0.4 MeV) remain.

So, the flux in band1 (0.7-0.8) is part of the falling spectrum from the pp chain. The flux here would be lower than the peak but still present. The flux in band2 (0.8-0.9) is even higher energy, so it's lower than band1.

So, the ratio before and after the pp-III stopping would be the same because the pp-III doesn't contribute to these bands. So, the ratio remains 1.

Therefore, the answer is C) 1.


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), in the Sun, assuming the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos with an energy of approximately 1.4 MeV. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Neutrino Sources in the Sun**:  
   - The proton-proton (pp) chain is the dominant source of solar neutrinos, contributing about 99% of the total neutrino flux. It includes the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches.  
   - The pp-I branch produces neutrinos with energies around 0.4 MeV.  
   - The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies around 1.4 MeV.  
   - The CNO cycle contributes the remaining 1% of neutrinos, with energies typically much higher (around 3-15 MeV).  

2. **Energy Bands in Question**:  
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV, or 0.7-0.8 MeV) is in the lower-energy range of the pp chain's spectrum.  
   - Band 2 (800-900 keV, or 0.8-0.9 MeV) is slightly higher in energy.  
   - The pp-III branch, which produces neutrinos at 1.4 MeV, is outside both bands and does not directly contribute to either band.  

3. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:  
   - The pp-III branch primarily affects neutrino flux at higher energies (around 1.4 MeV). Since both bands in question are below this energy, the flux in these bands is not directly affected by the cessation of the pp-III branch.  
   - The flux in band 1 and band 2 is dominated by the pp chain's lower-energy neutrinos (pp-I and the high-energy tail of the pp chain).  
   - The CNO cycle contributes neutrinos at much higher energies (3-15 MeV), so its contribution to bands 1 and 2 is negligible.  

4. **Flux Ratio Analysis**:  
   - The neutrino flux from the pp chain decreases with increasing energy, as the spectrum peaks around 0.4 MeV.  
   - Before the pp-III branch stopped, the flux in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) was higher than the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) because the spectrum is falling off at higher energies.  
   - Since the pp-III branch does not contribute to these bands, its cessation does not alter the relative flux in band 1 and band 2.  
   - Therefore, the ratio of flux (band 1) to flux (band 2) remains approximately 1.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The flux ratio between the two bands is unaffected by the cessation of the pp-III branch because the pp-III neutrinos are at 1.4 MeV, outside the energy range of the bands in question. The ratio remains the same as before the pp-III branch stopped.
