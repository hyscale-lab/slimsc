Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, and I need to find the normalized eigenvector's elements from the given options.

Wait, quantum operators for spin or something like that? Because I remember that spin operators have components like Sx, Sy, Sz, and their eigenvectors correspond to spin-up or down along certain axes.

The given operator P might be similar to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are 2x2 matrices, and when multiplied by ħ/2, they form the components of the spin operator for a spin-½ particle, like a muon.

So the problem provides Px, Py, Pz as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Right, that looks familiar. So, the operator P is the vector operator, so it's P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz, where n is the direction vector.

But wait, the direction is given as lying in the x-z plane. So n has components (nx, 0, nz), because in x-z, the y component is zero. So n is (something, 0, something) and it's a unit vector, so nx² + nz² = 1.

But the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. That complicates things because the eigenvector would depend on the angle θ, perhaps. Oh wait, but the question is asking about the eigenvector corresponding to +ħ/2 eigenvalue for this operator along n. So I need to find the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane.

I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates for a given direction are the spin-up and down states, which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of Sz. So, for a general direction, the eigenvectors are superpositions of the |+z> and |-z> states.

Alternatively, the eigenvectors can be expressed using spherical harmonics or in terms of angles. For example, the state can be written as a superposition of |+z> and |-z>, with coefficients depending on the angles θ and φ, but since the direction is in x-z plane, the φ (azimuthal angle) is zero or π, so maybe only θ matters.

Wait, the direction vector in x-z plane would have φ=0, right? Because x-z plane is φ=0 or pi, depending on direction. So, the state would be a function of θ, the polar angle from the z-axis.

So, the eigenvector for spin-up along direction n should be a combination of spin-up and spin-down along z, scaled by some factors involving θ.

Let me think about how to compute the eigenvector. The operator P is (n_x Px + n_z Pz), since in the x-z plane, n_y is zero.

Wait, no, wait. The direction is arbitrary in x-z, so n has components (nx, 0, nz). So, the operator along n is P_n = nx Px + nz Pz.

Because Py is multiplied by n_y, which is zero here. Oh right.

So, P_n = nx * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix.

Let me denote the matrix elements as:

[ [ (nz*(ħ/2)), (nx*(ħ/2)) ],
  [ (nx*(ħ/2)), -(nz*(ħ/2)) ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each term.

The first term, nx * Px: 

nx*(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, nx ħ/2], [nx ħ/2, 0]]

The second term, nz * Pz: 

nz*(ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[nz ħ/2, 0], [0, -nz ħ/2]]

Adding them together:

P_n = [ [nz ħ/2, nx ħ/2 ], [nx ħ/2, -nz ħ/2 ] ]

Yes, that looks right.

Now, we're to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So, let me write the matrix equation:

[ [nz*(ħ/2), nx*(ħ/2) ],
  [nx*(ħ/2), -nz*(ħ/2)] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Let me write this as a matrix equation without the ħ/2 factor to make it easier. Dividing both sides by ħ/2:

[ [nz, nx],
  [nx, -nz] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the equation becomes:

nz a + nx b = a
nx a - nz b = b

Which gives two equations:

1) nz a + nx b = a → (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0

2) nx a - nz b = b → nx a - (nz + 1) b = 0

Hmm, but for a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients should be zero. Alternatively, since the two equations are the same, perhaps we can use them to find a ratio between a and b.

Wait, let's take equation 1: (nz -1) a + nx b =0 → (nz-1) a = -nx b → a = [nx/(1 - nz)] b

But wait, let me think. Let's use equation 1:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0 → a = [nx (b)] / (1 - nz)

Similarly, from equation 2: nx a = (nz +1) b → a = [ (nz +1) / nx ] b

Wait, but we have two expressions for a in terms of b. So:

(nx / (1 - nz)) ) = (nz +1)/ nx )

So, cross-multiplying:

nx^2 = (1 - nz) (nz +1) )

Wait, (1 - nz) (nz +1) )= 1 - nz^2. So,

nx^2 = 1 - nz^2

Which is correct because nx^2 + nz^2 =1 (since n is a unit vector).

So, this doesn't give any new information. So, we can proceed by expressing a in terms of b from equation 1.

So a = [ nx / (1 - nz) ] b

Let me denote this ratio as (a/b) = [ nx ] / (1 - nz )

But let me think about this. Let's say we write the eigenvector as [a; b] = b [ nx/(1-nz), 1 ]

Wait, but I can choose b as a normalization factor, but we'll have to normalize the vector.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of angles. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, let's parameterize n with an angle θ from the z-axis.

So, n = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ )

But since we're in the x-z plane, φ=0. So, n = (sin θ, 0, cos θ )

Thus, nx = sin θ, nz = cos θ.

So, substituting into the ratio a/b = [nx]/(1 - nz) = sin θ / (1 - cos θ )

Hmm, 1 - cos θ is 2 sin^2 (θ/2 )

And sin θ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )

So, sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] ]

Simplify numerator and denominator: 2 cancels, sin² in denominator.

So, [ 2 sin cos ] / [ 2 sin² ] → (cos)/(sin) = cot (θ/2 )

So, a/b = cot(θ/2 )

So, a = b cot(θ/2 )

Which is the same as a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] b → a = cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) * b.

But we can write the eigenvector as [a; b] = b [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ]

Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, since the eigenvector is determined up to a scalar multiple, we can choose b= sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2). Wait no, because [a; b] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. If a = [ nx/(1 - nz) ] b, and nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So, a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Expressed in terms of θ/2, since 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ=2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] * b

Simplify numerator and denominator: 2 cancels, sin^2 in denominator.

So, a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b → a = cot(θ/2) b.

So, choosing b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2).

So, then the vector is [a, b] = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, but I thought this was the eigenvector for spin-up along the z-axis. Wait, no, because in this case, the direction is along (x, z), so the eigenvector depends on theta. Hmm, but for the z-direction, theta is 0, and then the state would be [1, 0], which is correct.

Wait, but earlier when we set a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2), but that's when the operator is in the z-direction. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, let's think about another approach. The eigenstate for spin-up along a direction (nx, 0, nz) can be written as a superposition of the |+z> and |-z> states.

In general, the eigenvector can be written as |+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) | -z>

But since in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So, the phase factor is 1. So, the state becomes cos(theta/2) |+z> + sin(theta/2) |−z>.

Expressed as a vector, |+z> is [1; 0], and |−z> is [0; 1]. So, the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's what I found earlier. So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, looking at the options, let me see:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar, but that doesn't make much sense because the eigenvector shouldn't have hbar in it. Hmm, no, eigenvectors are dimensionless, so hbar is not part of the vector.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that's spherical coordinates, but phi is zero here, so it would be (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but that's different from our result.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)). Wait, that includes hbar which is not dimensionally correct for an eigenvector.

So, the only option that matches our result is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenvector I derived is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C. So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it has components $(n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The operator along $\vec{n}$ is $\vec{P}_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$. Substituting the given matrices, $\vec{P}_n$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P}_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P}_n \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, this simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This gives two equations:

1. $(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0$,  
2. $n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0$.

From these, we find the ratio $a/b = n_x / (1 - n_z)$. Using the parameterization of $\vec{n}$ in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ from the z-axis (with $\phi = 0$ in the x-z plane), we have:

\[
n_x = \sin\theta, \quad n_z = \cos\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the ratio, $a/b = \sin\theta / (1 - \cos\theta)$. Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
a/b = \cot(\theta/2).
\]

Choosing $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ and $a = \cos(\theta/2)$, the eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C. The other options are inconsistent with the derived result. For example:

- Option A includes $\hbar$, which is dimensionally incorrect for an eigenvector.  
- Option B does not match the derived form.  
- Option D includes unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and incorrect normalization.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
