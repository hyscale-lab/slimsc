--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one it is based on the spectroscopic data provided.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, the presence of a peak around 3000 could be due to N-H, but I don't think that's the case here. But more likely, it's an alcohol or maybe a carbonyl group with hydrogen bonding, like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is usually a strong C=O stretch, which could be in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 is a bit lower, so maybe a conjugated carbonyl or something else. Wait, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like an aromatic ketone? Or perhaps an ester or amide. But amides usually have lower carbonyl stretches, around 1650. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. 

Wait, another thought: if the FTIR shows a peak at 3000 that's broad, that could be an alcohol's O-H stretch. But then the peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be two different carbonyl groups. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else, like an aromatic ring with conjugation. Alternatively, 1650 could be due to an aromatic ring (like C=C stretch in an aromatic compound). Wait, for a benzene ring, the C=C stretch is around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 could be a ring with conjugation, maybe a carbonyl adjacent to it. 

Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl (like ketone or ester), and the 1650 is an aromatic ring or another carbonyl group. But having two carbonyl peaks? That would suggest the presence of two different carbonyl groups. Which compounds have two carbonyl groups? Maybe something like a diketone, but that's less common. Alternatively, if it's an ester, which has a carbonyl, but perhaps the 1650 is from an adjacent group, like an aromatic ring. Or maybe it's an acid derivative, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the 1H NMR info. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has at least one double bond. So maybe there's an alkene group in the structure.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, what could that be? Common fragments at 45 could be a CH3CO+ ion (which is 45, since CH3CO+ is (12*2 + 1*3 + 16) = 45). So that would suggest a fragment with a ketone group, like an acetone fragment. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an acetylation, like an acetyl group.

Putting this together, let's think about the possible structures. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Hmm, each of these has different degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate degrees of unsaturation for each. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or N here.

For each option:

A) C6H12O2:
C=6, H=12, O=2.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond.

Wait, no: wait, let me recalculate. The formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero:
(2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one degree of unsaturation. That could be one ring plus a double bond or one double bond.

B) C6H10O: 
DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond.

C) C6H10O2:
DoU = (14 -10)/2=2. So same as option B, two DoU.

D) C6H12O:
(14-12)/2=1 DoU. So one ring or one double bond.

Now, looking back at the data. The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the structure must have at least one double bond. So the number of DoU must be at least one for each, which all options except maybe A and D have more. Wait, options A and D have one DoU, which could include a double bond or a ring. So if the compound has a double bond, then the DoU must be at least one.

But looking again at the FTIR: the 3000 cm^-1 is a broad peak, likely O-H (like alcohol or carboxylic acid). The 1700 and 1650 could be two carbonyl groups. Wait, but if the compound is an ester, for example, it has a carbonyl (from the ester group). If it's a cyclic ester or something else, maybe another carbonyl? Or perhaps it's a ketone and an ester.

Wait, but if the compound has two carbonyl groups, that would add two DoU. So let's see the options. Let's consider each formula and the possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation is 1. If it's a cyclic structure with an ester group, which has a carbonyl. So the ring contributes 1 DoU, and the ester has a carbonyl which is another DoU. But then the DoU would be 2, which doesn't match. So this might not fit. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) would have a ring (1 DoU) and the ester carbonyl (another DoU), making two DoU. But this formula only has one DoU, so that's a problem. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option B: C6H10O. Degree of unsaturation 2. So perhaps a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But considering the FTIR, maybe the two carbonyls would require 2 DoU. But wait, if the compound has both an O-H (like an alcohol) and a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester), then that could account for some DoU.

Wait, but the FTIR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring. But benzene rings have C=C stretches around 1450-1600. So 1650 is a bit higher for a benzene, but maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group. So perhaps the compound has a carbonyl and a ring.

Alternatively, the compound could be a cyclic ketone, but that would not explain the two carbonyl peaks.

Hmm, maybe the compound is a β-keto ester or something with two carbonyl groups. But let's think about the molecular formula.

Looking at the mass spectrum, a fragment at m/z=45. As I thought earlier, that's likely a CH3CO+ fragment. So that would suggest that the molecule has an acetyl group (CH3CO-). So the presence of an acetyl group would imply a carbonyl group.

Now, putting this together: if the molecule has an acetyl group, perhaps as an ester or ketone, and another carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, but then the degree of unsaturation should account for each carbonyl. So each carbonyl is one DoU. So if there are two carbonyls, that's two DoU. Looking at the options, which have two DoU?

Options B and C each have two DoU.

Option B: C6H10O. Two DoU. If it's a diketone or has two carbonyl groups, but wait, the formula is C6H10O. Let's think. A diketone would be O=C-R-C=O. But for a six-carbon compound with two ketone groups, the formula would have O2. But option B has only one O, so that's not possible. So that can't be. So maybe it's something else.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two DoU. So, possible structures: maybe an ester and a ring, or two ester groups? Or a ring and an ester group. Alternatively, a cyclic ester (lactone) which would have a ring and a carbonyl, contributing two DoU.

Wait, a cyclic ester (lactone) would have a ring (1 DoU) and the ester carbonyl (another DoU), making two in total. So that fits option C's DoU.

But then, the FTIR shows O-H? Well, lactones are cyclic esters and are usually not acidic like carboxylic acids. The O-H in the FTIR would be more likely an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but if it's a lactone, maybe the structure has an alcohol group elsewhere? Or perhaps not, because lactones are formed from esterification of a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is likely O-H. If the compound is a lactone, it doesn't have an -OH group because the ester is formed. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Let me think again. The O-H in the IR suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have a COOH group, but that would require two oxygen atoms (COOH has two O). Let's look at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. So two O's. That could fit a COOH group. If the compound is a substituted benzoic acid, for example, with an ester group or something else.

Alternatively, if it's an ester with an alcohol group elsewhere. So perhaps a structure like an ester and an alcohol.

Wait, but let's consider the NMR data. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So the structure must have an alkene (double bond) or perhaps an aromatic ring (which is a conjugated double bond system). But the presence of a single double bond (as in an alkene) would contribute one DoU, and a ring another. 

Wait, maybe the structure is an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group. For example, a benzene ring with a ketone group (like acetophenone). But acetophenone would be C6H5COCH3, which is C8H8O. But our options are all C6 compounds.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexenone (a six-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone). Let's see: cyclohexenone would be C6H10O. DoU is (2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So yes, two DoU. So that fits option B. But the FTIR would have a broad O-H peak, but cyclohexenone is a ketone without an O-H group. So that wouldn't fit the O-H peak in the IR. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps it's a diol with a carbonyl group. Or an ester with an alcohol.

Wait, another approach: looking at the molecular formulas and the mass spec. The mass spec has a fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about what fragments would give that. CH3CO+ is 45. So that suggests an acetyl group is present in the molecule. So the molecule probably has an acetyl group. So, structures with an acetyl group.

So, they would have (CH3CO) as part of the structure.

Looking at the options again. Let's see:

Option A: C6H12O2. So if the molecule is an ester with an acetyl group. For example, ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3, which is C4H8O2. That's four carbons. Our molecule is C6. So perhaps a larger ester, like an ester of a four-carbon acid and a two-carbon alcohol, but that would be C6H12O2. Wait, ethyl propionate is CH3CH2COOCH2CH3, which is C5H10O2. Hmm, not matching. Wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester with an acetyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an acetyl group. But a ketone would have a carbonyl, but how would that fit into the molecular formula?

Wait, let's think about option A: C6H12O2. The molecular formula suggests an ester because esters have the formula RCOOR', which gives a molecular formula with O2. So if it's an ester, perhaps with an acetyl group (CH3COO-) and another group.

Wait, for example, if it's methyl propanoate, that's CH3CH2COOCH3, which is C4H8O2. But that's four carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the structure as a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. For example, a cyclic ester with an acetyl group. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: considering the molecular formula and possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 1. So one ring or one double bond. If it's a ring plus an ester group (which has a carbonyl), that would contribute two DoU, but the formula only allows one. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps it's a double bond and an ester group. But that would make two DoU, which again doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a ring, but that might complicate things.

Let me think about the other options.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the compound has a ring (e.g., cyclohexane) and a double bond somewhere, that would account for two DoU. Or perhaps a ring and a carbonyl group. Wait, a ring (1 DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU), so two in total. That fits. So perhaps it's a cyclohexanone with an ester group or something similar.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad O-H peak, so maybe it's an alcohol as well. So perhaps an ester and an alcohol group in the same molecule? For example, a structure like a substituted cyclohexanol with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a β-keto ester. Let's say something like CH2(COOR)COOR, but that might not fit the carbon count. Alternatively, a cyclic structure with a ketone and an ester. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, let's think about the possible fragments in the mass spectrum. The m/z=45 is a key clue. If it's an acetyl group (CH3CO+), then perhaps the molecule has an acetyl group attached. So structures with acetyl groups would include esters, ketones, acids, etc.

So, option A is C6H12O2. If it's an ester with an acetyl group, that would fit. For example, something like CH3COO(CH2)3CH3. That would be ethyl pentanoate? Wait, no— the formula for ethyl pentanoate is CH3CH2OOCCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me figure it out. The general formula for an ester is RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups. So, the molecular formula would be (n + m + 2) carbons, where R is n carbons and R' is m carbons. So, if the ester is an acetyl group (R=2 carbons, R' = 4 carbons), the formula would be C6H12O2. Because acetyl is 2 carbons (CH3CO-), and the R' would be (for example) butyl, which is 4 carbons (but R' is an alkyl group, so O connected to R'). So, if R is acetyl (2 carbons), R' is butyl (4 carbons), the ester would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH3. So that's C6H12O2, which matches option A. 

So the structure would be pentyl acetate: CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that's pentyl acetate would be acetyl (2 carbons) plus pentyl (5 carbons), but that would make 7 carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think. Acetyl is CH3CO-, which is two carbons. So if R' is ethyl (two carbons), then the ester would be CH3COOCH2CH3. That's ethyl acetate, which is C4H8O2, not matching. So to get C6H12O2, the R and R' need to add up to four carbons in total, but wait: the ester formula is RCOOR', where R is acetyl (2 carbons), so RCOO is 3 carbons (CH3COO-), and R' is another 3 carbons (like propyl). So, propyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH3, which is C5H10O2. Hmm, that's five carbons. Wait, maybe it's another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which is an ester formed from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol in the same molecule. But for a six-carbon lactone, the ring would be five-membered, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's not an ester but a ketone with another functional group that contributes to the O's. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is likely an O-H stretch. So the compound could have an alcohol group (-OH). Then, the 1700 cm^-1 is a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone. So if it's an ester and an alcohol, that would fit. So perhaps the structure is a substituted ester with an alcohol group. But that would require two oxygen atoms, which is present in options A and C.

Wait, but let's look at the NMR. There are vinyl hydrogens, which are on a double bond. So the structure must have a double bond. So maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond, or perhaps an ester with an alkene.

Wait, for option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 1. So one ring or a double bond. If it's a ring, say a five-membered ring with an ester group, that would account for the two O's. But wait, if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), that has a ring and a carbonyl. So that's two DoU, but option A only has one. So that wouldn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the structure is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. But that would require O2, and the DoU would be two (ring and ketone). So that fits option C (C6H10O2), which has two DoU.

Wait, let me think. Option C is C6H10O2. That would allow for structures with two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the structure is a cyclohexene with a carbonyl group and an O-H group, that would account for two DoU (ring and double bond, but that would be two DoU, which matches). But wait, cyclohexene has one DoU (the ring), and a double bond would be another. So that's two, which fits.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester (like an acyl group and an alcohol-derived group). But the DoU is 1, so either a ring or a double bond. If it's an ester with a double bond, then that would require two DoU, which doesn't fit. So maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a single ring, which would contribute one DoU (the ring), and the ester function. Wait, a lactone would have a ring (from the ester group) and the carbonyl, which would mean two DoU. So that doesn't fit option A, which has only one DoU.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is 2. Structures could be a cyclohexene ring with a ketone, or a diene with an alcohol, etc. But the O is only one, so maybe an alcohol and a ketone. But that would require two O's. Hmm, so that's not possible. So perhaps not option B.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So structures could be a cyclohexene ring plus a carbonyl (like a ketone), which would give two DoU. Alternatively, a benzene ring but that's three DoU. So maybe a five-membered ring with a carbonyl group, and a double bond elsewhere. Or perhaps an ester group and a ring.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU is 1. So either a ring or a double bond. But the presence of O-H and a carbonyl (from FTIR) would require two O's, which isn't present here. So probably not option D.

So, which options are left? A, C.

Now, considering the mass spec fragment at m/z=45, which is likely CH3CO+. So the compound must have an acetyl group. 

If it's an ester, then the acetyl would be part of the ester. So, for option A, an ester with an acetyl group, but the DoU might not fit. For option C, it could be a structure like a cyclohexene with an ester group.

Wait, if the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have a ring (DoU 1) and a carbonyl (DoU 1), so two DoU, which would fit option C (C6H10O2). But in a lactone, the O is part of the ester, so the structure would be a cyclic ester, which means the O is part of the ring. So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2 because the lactone structure is O in the ring.

So, how does that fit? Let me count. A six-membered lactone (like δ-valerolactone) has the structure O(C5H9CO). Wait, no, δ-valerolactone is a five-membered ring. Let me think; a six-membered lactone would be ε-caprolactone. Its structure is an oxygen in a six-membered ring, with a ketone group. So the formula for ε-caprolactone is C5H8O2. Wait, no. Let me think: the formula for a lactone is generally CnH2nO2. So for a six-membered ring (ε-caprolactone), n would be 5. So the formula is C5H8O2. Hmm, but our compound is C6H10O2 (option C). So perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, maybe the structure isn't a lactone. Maybe it's a regular ester with a ring. For example, an ester group attached to a cyclohexane ring. But that would require the ring to contribute one DoU and the ester another, making two DoU, which matches option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group attached. For example, an ester group as a substituent on the cyclohexene. So the cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond, giving two DoU, and the ester provides two O's. Wait, but the formula for that would need to be C6H10O2.

Wait, let me think about that. If the cyclohexene has a substituent that's an ester group, like OCO-R. So for example, cyclohexene with an ester group attached. The formula for cyclohexene is C6H10. If the ester is OCO-R, then R would add more carbons. Wait, but no, in this case, the entire molecule is C6H10O2, so the ester would be part of the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a γ-keto ester. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond. So the structure has a double bond, which would be a DoU. The IR shows O-H, so an alcohol group (another O). Then, the carbonyl groups are in the IR. So maybe the structure has both an alcohol and a ketone. But that would require two O's. So O's would be from the alcohol (OH) and the ketone (O), so two O's: O2. That would fit options A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's a diol with a ketone, that would require more O's. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, an ester and an alcohol. But that would require three O's. Wait, no. An ester is O2: R-O-CO-O-R'. Wait, no. An ester group is RCOOR', which has two O's. So if the compound is an ester, that's two O's. If there's an additional OH group, that would require a third O, which isn't present in options A or C.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the O count. The IR suggests O-H (so OH group), and the 1700 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl, which is CO. So the oxygen count would be at least two: one for the OH and one for the carbonyl. So the molecular formula must have at least two O's. The options A and C have two O's, and B and D have one or two.

So, options A, C, and B (if it has two O's, but B has only one O). So B is out because the IR suggests two O's (OH and carbonyl).

So, between A (C6H12O2), C (C6H10O2), and D (C6H12O, which can't have two O's).

So, the IR suggests two O's: OH and carbonyl. So options A and C.

So, the structure must have both an OH group and a carbonyl group. So, perhaps a ketone and an alcohol.

But wait, a molecule with both a ketone and an alcohol group would have O2. So, for a six-carbon compound, that would fit either option A or C.

But then, the degrees of unsaturation. Let me recalculate.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 + 2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1 DoU. So one ring or one double bond.

If the structure is a cyclohexanol with a ketone, that would require two DoU (ring for cyclohexanol and another for the ketone). But option A only has one DoU. So that can't be.

Alternatively, a molecule with a double bond and an ester. So, maybe a di-substituted alkene with an ester group. That would contribute two DoU: one for the double bond and one for the ester carbonyl. But option A has only one DoU, which wouldn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the molecular weight. Let's see, the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be (6×12)+(10×1)+(2×16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol.

The mass spectrum's fragment at 45 could be from the acetyl group. So, if the main molecule breaks off the acetyl, giving m/z=45.

So, perhaps the structure is something like CH3CO-O-R, where R is a four-carbon group with a double bond. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's think about the structure as a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. The ester would have the carbonyl group, and perhaps the ring could have a double bond. So, the ring (DoU 1) and the ester (another DoU), making two. That fits.

But would such a structure have an O-H group? No, because the ester is O-R-O-CO-. Wait, no, esters don't have an O-H group. So the O-H in the IR must come from somewhere else.

Ah, perhaps it's a hydroxyl group and an ester. So the structure would have both an -OH and an ester group. That would require three O's, which none of the options have. Wait, option C has two O's, so that can't be. So maybe the O-H is from a different functional group, like an acid.

Wait, but the O count is two, so the molecule can't have both an -OH and a carbonyl group unless I'm missing something. Because each of those requires O. Wait, an -OH is O, a carbonyl is O. So two O's in total. So the structure could be an aldehyde (which has a carbonyl and an O), but aldehyde only requires one O.

Wait, no. Wait, aldehyde is RCHO, which has one O. If the molecule has an OH group and an aldehyde group, that would require two O's, which is possible in options A and C.

But the FTIR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650, which are both carbonyl regions. So having an aldehyde and another carbonyl isn't likely in a six-carbon molecule. So perhaps it's a diketone, but that would require two O's. But a diketone would have two carbonyl groups, each in the 1700 range. But the FTIR in this case shows 1700 and 1650, so perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. But that would require three O's, which isn't present in any of the options except A and C. Wait, option C has two O's. So perhaps a molecule with a cyclic ketone (which has one O) and an -OH group (another O), making two O's.

So, a cyclohexanol derivative with a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group with both a ketone and an alcohol. But that would require two O's and the structure would have two DoU (the ring and the ketone). So for option C, which has two DoU, this could fit.

But would such a structure have the IR peaks? The O-H would absorb around 3000, the ketone C=O around 1700, but the other peak at 1650 would need another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring. But without an aromatic ring, that peak is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is from a conjugated carbonyl, like in an α,β-unsaturated ketone. So, the structure is a cyclohexene with a ketone group conjugated to the double bond, making the carbonyl peak appear at a lower wavenumber (like 1650). So that could explain the 1650 peak as a conjugated carbonyl.

In that case, the structure would have a double bond (DoU 1) and a ketone (DoU 1), making two DoU, which fits option C. The O-H would come from an alcohol group attached somewhere else. But wait, that would require three O's. Hmm, no, because the ketone is one O, the alcohol is another O. So two O's total, which fits option C.

So, the structure would be something like cyclohexenol with a ketone group. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclopentanone with an ester group. But I'm getting stuck.

Another angle: let's look at the molecular formula for option C, C6H10O2. The possible structures could be:

- An ester and a double bond. For example, an ester group (O2) and a double bond (DoU 1), making two DoU.

So, the structure could be an ester with an alkene, which would contribute a double bond. The O's would be from the ester (two O's). But where does the O-H come from? Because the FTIR shows a broad O-H. So if the structure is an ester and an alcohol, that would require three O's, which isn't possible.

Wait, maybe the O-H is part of the ester. No, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diol with an ester group. But that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a β-keto ester. A β-keto ester has two carbonyl groups: one from the ketone and one from the ester. So, the structure would be O=C-O-CO-, but that's not possible. Wait, β-keto esters have the structure RCO-COOR', which would have two carbonyl groups (the ketone and the ester). So in that case, the FTIR would show two peaks around 1700 and perhaps a bit lower for the ketone if it's conjugated.

So, a β-keto ester would have two carbonyl groups, which could explain the two peaks in the IR. The O's come from the ester (two O's). The H NMR would have vinyl hydrogens if there's a double bond. But β-keto esters don't have double bonds, unless it's an enone. So maybe it's a β-keto ester with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but the molecular formula for a β-keto ester with six carbons would be... let's see.

Option C is C6H10O2. A β-keto ester would have the structure CH2(COOR)COOR', but getting the formula right is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a
