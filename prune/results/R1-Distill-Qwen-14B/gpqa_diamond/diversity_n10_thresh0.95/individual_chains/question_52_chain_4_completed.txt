--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

The question is about a star whose properties change when spots cover part of its surface. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So the ratio is N1/N2, where N1 is the number of Ti atoms in level 1 and N2 in level 2. When there are spots, this ratio goes down. So the question is, by what factor does this ratio change: N1/N2 without spots divided by N1/N2 with spots, I think.

Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So when the star is spotless, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = some number greater than 1.

I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Either way, the key is the exponential term depends on temperature.

But wait, in this problem, the presence of spots changes the effective temperature of the photosphere. However, the star's photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so each region's temperature determines the level populations there.

Wait, but the star has spots which are cooler regions. So when 40% of the surface is spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. But does that mean that each part of the photosphere is at 5500 K, or that a mix of 6000 K and cooler spots?

Wait, I need to clarify. The problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So that's the average Teff as observed, but the actual surface has two regions: the unspotted parts at 6000 K and the spotted parts presumably at a lower temperature.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the stellar photosphere. So for each region (spot and non-spot), the ratio depends on their local temperature.

Wait, but the problem is considering the photosphere as a whole when spots are present. So when there are spots, the overall photosphere has a temperature of 5500 K. But that's the effective temperature, which is an average. However, the LTE assumption is per region, not the average. So each region (spot or not) has its own temperature, and the overall spectrum is a mix of those regions.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So in the case without spots, all the photosphere is at 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots (which are cooler), the other 60% is at 6000 K, and the 40% at a lower temperature, say T_spot.

Wait, but in the problem, when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But how does that relate to the individual T_spot?

Wait, effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity. The star's luminosity when spots are present is L = (0.6 L_6000 + 0.4 L_spot ), where L_6000 is the luminosity per unit area at 6000 K, and L_spot is the luminosity per unit area of the spots, which are cooler.

The effective temperature is given by L_total = 4π R^2 σ Teff^4.

So without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, so L = 4π R^2 σ (6000)^4.

With spots, 40% of the surface is at T_spot, and 60% at 6000 K. So the total luminosity would be 0.6 L_6000 + 0.4 L_spot, where L_6000 is the flux from the non-spots (which is σ T_eff_non_spot^4, but wait, no: L = 4π R^2 σ Teff^4. So without spots, the entire surface emits at 6000 K.

With spots, the total luminosity would be (0.6 * (T_non_spot)^4 + 0.4 * (T_spot)^4 ) * 4π R^2 σ.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the total luminosity when spots are present is the sum of the luminosity from the spotted and non-spotted regions. Each region contributes based on area and temperature.

L_total = L0 * (0.6 * (T_non_spot)^4 + 0.4 * (T_spot)^4 )

Where L0 is 4π R^2 σ. Since without spots, L0*(Teff=6000)^4 is the luminosity.

But when spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500 K, so L_total = L0*(5500)^4.

So equate the two:

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4

We can solve for T_spot.

Let me compute that.

Let me compute each term.

First, compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5500^4 is (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12.

5.5^4: 5.5^2=30.25; 30.25^2 = 915.0625. So 5.5^4 = 915.0625. So 5500^4 = 915.0625e12.

So:

0.6 * (6000)^4 = 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

0.4 * (T_spot)^4 = ?

So,

7.776e14 + 0.4 * (T_spot)^4 = 915.0625e12.

Wait, 915.0625e12 is 9.150625e14.

So subtracting:

0.4 * (T_spot)^4 = 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = (915.0625 - 777.6) * 1e14? Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 915.0625e12 is 9.150625e14, and 7.776e14 is 777.6e12.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the exponents. Let me make it in terms of 1e14.

So 0.6*(6000^4) = 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

Similarly, 0.4*(T_spot^4) = ?

So:

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4.

In terms of 1e14:

7.776e14 + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 9.150625e14.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

So 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 0.7776e15 = 7.776e14.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e14.

So the equation is:

7.776e14 + 0.4 * T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Subtract 7.776e14: 0.4 * T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = (9.150625 - 7.776) e14 = 1.374625e14.

So T_spot^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = (1.374625 / 0.4 )e14 = 3.4365625e14.

Wait, T_spot^4 = 3.4365625e14.

So T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute 3.4365625e14.

Let me express this as 3.4365625 x 1e14.

Taking the fourth root: (3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4).

1e14 is (1e3.5)^4, because (1e3.5)^4 = (1e3.5)^4 = (1e3)^4 * (1e0.5)^4 = 1e12 * 1e2 = 1e14.

So (1e14)^(1/4) = 1e3.5 ≈ 3162.27766.

And the fourth root of 3.4365625:

Let me compute 3.4365625^(0.25).

I know that 3.4365625 is between 1.3^4 and 1.4^4. Let's compute:

1.3^4 = 2.8561.

1.4^4 = 3.8416.

3.4365625 is between these. Let's find x where x^4 = 3.4365625.

Let me try 1.35^4: 1.35^2=1.8225, squared again: (1.8225)^2 ≈ 3.32 approx 3.32. Hmm, but 3.32 is less than 3.43656.

Next, 1.36^2 = 1.8496. Then, 1.8496^2 ≈ 3.421. Still less than 3.4365.

1.37^2 = 1.8769. 1.8769^2 is approx 3.523. Hmm, that's over.

So perhaps around 1.365.

Wait, 1.36^4 is about 3.421 as we saw. 1.365^4: Let me compute.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it numerically.

But maybe I can just compute the fourth root of 3.4365625.

Wait, 3.4365625 is 3.4365625 = 107/31. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms.

Natural log of 3.4365625 is approximately 1.235.

Divided by 4, it's 0.30875.

Exponentiating e^0.30875 ≈ 1.36. Because e^0.3 is about 1.34986, e^0.30875 is approx 1.36.

So T_spot^4 = 3.4365625e14 → T_spot ≈ 1.36 * 3.162e3 ≈ 1.36 * 3162 = 4314 K.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, earlier we had that T_spot^4 is 3.43656e14, which is 3.43656e14 = 3.43656 x 1e14.

Wait, 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4, so 1e14^(1/4)=1e3.5≈3162. So 3.43656e14^(1/4) = (3.43656)^(1/4) * 1e3.5.

We found that (3.43656)^(1/4) ≈1.36. So 1.36 * 3162 ≈ 4314 K.

Wait, but that would make the spots at about 4314 K, which seems quite hot for a spot. Typically, I thought spots are much cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Like, perhaps 3000 K or something. But I'm not sure. Maybe I've done a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the approach is wrong. Because when the spots are present, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K. But perhaps the areas not covered by spots are still at 6000 K. So the star's photosphere is a mix of two regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at T_spot.

Wait, but the way the problem is worded: when the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff drops to 5500 K.

So when spots are present, the star's overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star as a whole emits at 5500 K, but the surface has 60% at 6000 K and 40% at T_spot.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mixture of two regions: non-spots and spots. So the observed line is a blend of lines from these two regions.

But the problem says that the photosphere is in LTE, so each region's level populations are determined by their own temperature.

So in the case without spots, the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where T is 6000 K.

In the case with spots, the photosphere is a mix of two regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at T_spot (which we found to be about 4314 K, but that seems too high for a spot; maybe the approach is wrong).

Wait, but maybe the approach to find T_spot is incorrect. Because the effective temperature is the fourth root of the average of the fourth powers, weighted by area. So when 40% is spotted, the effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, let me re-derive the equation correctly.

The star's total luminosity when spots are present is the sum of the luminosity from the non-spotted and spotted regions.

The non-spotted area is 60% of the surface, so A_non = 0.6 * 4π R^2.

The spotted area is 40%, A_spot = 0.4 * 4π R^2.

The flux from each area is sigma T^4.

So total luminosity L = (A_non * sigma T_non^4) + (A_spot * sigma T_spot^4 ).

Since luminosity is also L = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4, where Teff is 5500 K.

So,

4 pi R^2 sigma (5500)^4 = (0.6 * 4 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4 ) + (0.4 * 4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4 )

We can cancel out 4 pi R^2 sigma from all terms:

(5500)^4 = 0.6 (6000)^4 + 0.4 (T_spot)^4

So,

0.4 (T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4 - 0.6 (6000)^4

Compute each term:

Compute (5500)^4:

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12 = 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

Compute (6000)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

So,

0.6 * 6000^4 = 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

Then,

0.4 (T_spot)^4 = 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

So,

(T_spot)^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Taking the fourth root:

T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

We found earlier that 3.4365625e14 is approximately 3.43656e14, and the fourth root is approximately 1.36e3.5.

Wait, 3.43656e14 is 3.43656 x 10^14. 10^14 is (10^3.5)^4, so 10^3.5 is about 3162.

So,

(3.43656e14) = (3.43656) * (10^14) = (3.43656) * ( (1e3.5)^4 )

Taking the fourth root gives (3.43656)^(1/4) * 1e3.5.

Compute (3.43656)^(1/4) ≈ 1.36.

So,

T_spot ≈ 1.36 * 3162 ≈ 4314 K.

Hmm, that seems incorrect because 4314 K is not that much cooler than 6000 K, and spots usually are significantly cooler. But perhaps the problem states that the effective temperature drops to 5500 K, which is a significant drop, so the spots must be making a substantial contribution.

Wait, but let's check the calculation again.

0.6*(6e3)^4 = 0.6*(1.296e15) = 7.776e14.

5500^4 = 9.150625e14.

So, 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

Divide by 0.4: 1.374625e14 / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

So, T_spot^4 = 3.4365625e14.

T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Wait, perhaps I can compute this more accurately.

Take natural logs: ln(3.4365625e14) = ln(3.4365625) + ln(1e14).

ln(3.4365625) ≈ 1.235.

ln(1e14) = 14 * ln(10) ≈ 14 * 2.302585 ≈ 32.236.

So total ln ≈ 1.235 + 32.236 = 33.471.

Divide by 4: 8.3678.

Exponentiate: e^8.3678 ≈ e^8 is 2980.91, e^0.3678 is ≈ 1.445.

So 2980.91 * 1.445 ≈ 4311 K.

Wait, so around 4311 K. Hmm, that's about 4300 K. That seems lower than the surrounding 6000 K, but not as cool as I thought spots usually are. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, we'll proceed with this value.

Now, the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2.

The ratio without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ), where T1 is 6000 K.

When spots are present, the photosphere is a mix of two regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at T_spot ≈4311 K.

Wait, but how does this affect the observed ratio of Ti levels?

Wait, but the ratio observed would be a weighted average of the two regions. Because the spectrum would be a blend of the two regions' emissions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that without spots, the entire photosphere is at 6000 K, so the ratio is based on T=6000 K.

When spots are present, the photosphere is at 5500 K as an average. But that's not correct because the photosphere isn't uniform; it's a mix. So perhaps the local regions have their own temperatures.

But wait, the problem says, in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, this ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So the ratio R is N1/N2.

In the case without spots, R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), where T1=6000 K.

In the case with spots, the photosphere has two regions: 60% at T1=6000 K and 40% at T_spot=4311 K.

So the observed ratio R2 would be a weighted average of R1 and R_spot, where R_spot is the ratio at T_spot.

Wait, no. Because each region contributes to the observed line profile, but each area has different populations. The observed ratio would not be a simple average but depends on the source function and how the lines form. Hmm, this might be more complicated.

Alternatively, the problem might be approximating that the effective temperature is 5500 K, so the ratio is based on T=5500 K. But that's not correct because the photosphere isn't at a uniform 5500 K; it's a mix of 6000 and 4311 K.

Wait, but the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the problem is considering that when spots are present, the photosphere is at 5500 K, and we should compute the ratio based on that temperature.

Wait, but the question says the photosphere is in LTE, which implies each region is in LTE, not the average. So the observed line is a blend of lines from 60% at 6000 K and 40% at 4311 K.

So the overall line profile would be a sum of the contributions from each region. The equivalent width or the line strength would depend on the contributions, but the ratio N1/N2 would be a weighted average of the two populations.

Wait, but perhaps we can model it as such. Let me think.

The ratio R in the absence of spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), with T1=6000 K.

When spots are present, the photosphere is a mix of two regions: 60% at T1 and 40% at T_spot.

So the observed ratio R2 is the sum of the contributions from each region, weighted by their area.

Wait, but how exactly? Because each region contributes according to their area and their respective populations.

Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is the flux-weighted average of N1/N2 in each region. Because the flux from each region is higher in hotter regions. So the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average, not an area-weighted one.

Because when you observe the line, you see the flux from each region, which is proportional to the area and the emission from that region.

So, the flux from the non-spotted regions is F1 = 0.6 * (pi R^2) * B_lambda(T1), and the flux from the spotted regions is F2 = 0.4 * (pi R^2) * B_lambda(T_spot), where B_lambda is the Planck function.

The total flux is F = F1 + F2.

But the line strength depends on the number of atoms in each state, which depends on the local N1 and N2.

Wait, but for each region, the population ratio is determined by their own temperature.

Assuming that the line is formed in the photosphere, and each region contributes to the line based on their area and their population ratio.

Wait, perhaps the equivalent width or the line strength depends on the sum of the contributions from each region. So the observed ratio R_observed would be a flux-weighted average of the individual R's.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when the star has spots, the entire photosphere is at 5500 K, but that's not correct. But perhaps the question is simplified.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the average temperature is 5500 K, so the ratio R is computed at T=5500 K.

But the problem says the photosphere is in LTE when the spots are present, so each region has its own temperature.

Hmm, perhaps the way to approach this is to compute the ratio without spots (R1) and the ratio with spots (R2), where R2 is the weighted average of the ratios in the two regions.

But wait, when spots are present, the photosphere is a mix of 60% at 6000 K and 40% at 4311 K.

So the observed ratio R2 is (0.6 * R1 + 0.4 * R_spot) / (0.6 + 0.4), but since 0.6+0.4=1, it's 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R_spot.

Wait, but that's an area-weighted average of the two ratios. But the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels. So the total N1 and N2 would be the sum from each region.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the total N1 and N2.

Let me denote:

Without spots:

Total N1 = N1_total = N1_6000 * (1), since all surface is at 6000 K.

Similarly, N2_total = N2_6000 * 1.

So the ratio R1 = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

With spots:

N1_total = N1_6000 * 0.6 + N1_spot * 0.4.

N2_total = N2_6000 * 0.6 + N2_spot * 0.4.

So the ratio R2 = [0.6 N1_6000 + 0.4 N1_spot] / [0.6 N2_6000 + 0.4 N2_spot}.

But since N1_6000 / N2_6000 = R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and N1_spot / N2_spot = R_spot = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spot) ).

So,

N1_6000 = R1 * N2_6000.

N1_spot = R_spot * N2_spot.

So,

R2 = [ 0.6 R1 N2_6000 + 0.4 R_spot N2_spot ] / [ 0.6 N2_6000 + 0.4 N2_spot ].

But the problem is that N2 is the total number of Ti atoms in level 2. Wait, but perhaps each region has the same density, so the number of atoms is proportional to the area. Because if the density is uniform, then N2_total = 0.6 N2_6000 + 0.4 N2_spot.

But each region has the same density, so N2_6000 = n_6000 * A_6000, and N2_spot = n_spot * A_spot.

But wait, the number of atoms is proportional to area times density. If the density is uniform, then A_6000 is 0.6 A_total, A_spot is 0.4 A_total.

So,

N2_total = (0.6 A_total) * n + (0.4 A_total) * n = (0.6 + 0.4) A_total n = A_total n.

Similarly,

N2_6000 = 0.6 A_total n,

N2_spot = 0.4 A_total n.

So,

N1_6000 = R1 * N2_6000 = R1 * 0.6 A_total n.

N1_spot = R_spot * N2_spot = R_spot * 0.4 A_total n.

So,

N1_total = 0.6 R1 A_total n + 0.4 R_spot A_total n.

Thus,

R2 = N1_total / N2_total = [0.6 R1 + 0.4 R_spot ] / 1.

Because N2_total = A_total n.

So,

R2 = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R_spot.

So the ratio when there are spots is R2 = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R_spot.

We need to find the factor by which R1 changes compared to R2.

So the factor is R1 / R2 = R1 / (0.6 R1 + 0.4 R_spot).

But the problem states that R decreases when the star has spots, so R2 < R1.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R2 < R1, which would mean that R1/R2 is greater than 1.

Now, let's compute this factor.

But first, we need to compute R_spot.

R_spot = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spot) )

Similarly, R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

So R_spot/R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T_spot) + ΔE/(k T1) ) = exp [ ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) ) ]

Compute ΔE/(k) = (hc)/(lambda k ), since ΔE = hc/lambda.

Given that lambda is 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

But perhaps we can compute the exponent.

Let me compute (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) where T1 =6000 K, T_spot=4311 K.

1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667,

1/4311 ≈ 0.000232.

So,

(1/T1 - 1/T_spot) = 0.00016667 - 0.000232 ≈ -0.00006533.

So,

ΔE/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T_spot ) = (hc/(lambda k )) * (1/T1 - 1/T_spot )

Wait, but the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T_spot ) = (hc/(lambda k )) * (1/T1 - 1/T_spot )

Alternatively, considering that,

R_spot/R1 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T_spot - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, because R_spot/R1 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_spot) + ΔE/(k T1) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) )

Wait, no, let me correct.

Wait, R_spot = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spot) )

R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

So,

R_spot/R1 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_spot) + ΔE/(k T1) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) )

But T_spot < T1 because the spots are cooler.

So 1/T1 - 1/T_spot is negative, since T_spot < T1 → 1/T_spot > 1/T1.

So (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) is negative.

Therefore, the exponent is negative, so R_spot/R1 = exp( negative number ), which is less than 1. So R_spot < R1.

So,

R_spot = R1 * exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) )

Let me compute ΔE/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T_spot )

ΔE = hc / lambda.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s,

c = 3e8 m/s,

lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = approx 1.373e-18 J.

k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

Now, compute (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) = (1/6000 - 1/4311) ≈ (0.00016667 - 0.000232 ) ≈ -0.00006533.

So,

ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) ≈ 9.95e4 K * (-6.533e-5 1/K) ≈ -6.48e0 → approx -6.48.

Thus,

R_spot/R1 = exp( -6.48 ) ≈ exp(-6) ≈ 0.002479, but more accurately exp(-6.48) ≈ 0.0016.

Wait, let me compute exp(-6.48):

We know that exp(-6)≈0.002479, exp(-7)≈0.0009119. 6.48 is between 6 and 7.

Compute exp(-6.48) = 1 / exp(6.48).

Compute 6.48: exp(6) = 403.4288, exp(0.48) ≈ e^0.48 ≈ 1.616.

So, exp(6.48) ≈ 403.4288 * 1.616 ≈ 652.7.

So, exp(-6.48) ≈ 1/652.7 ≈ 0.001533.

So,

R_spot ≈ R1 * 0.001533.

Now, back to R2.

R2 = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R_spot = 0.6 R1 + 0.4*(0.001533 R1) ≈ 0.6 R1 + 0.0006132 R1 ≈ 0.6006132 R1.

Wait, that's almost 0.6 R1. Because R_spot is much smaller than R1.

So,

R2 ≈ 0.6 R1.

Wait, that makes the factor R1/R2 ≈ R1/(0.6 R1) = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options exactly. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of the factor. Let me redo it.

R_spot = R1 * exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) )

We found that to be R_spot = R1 * exp(-6.48) ≈ R1 * 0.001533.

So,

R2 = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 * (0.001533 R1 ) = (0.6 + 0.0006132) R1 ≈ 0.6006132 R1.

So,

R1 / R2 = R1 / (0.6006132 R1 ) ≈ 1 / 0.6006132 ≈ 1.665.

So approximately 1.665, which is around 1.67, but the options don't have that. The closest option is A) ~1.1, but that's not close.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent.

Let me recalculate the exponent.

Wait, I think I messed up the sign. Because when we compute R_spot/R1, we have:

R_spot/R1 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_spot) ) + ΔE/(k T1) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) )

But since T_spot < T1, the exponent becomes negative, so R_spot/R1 = exp( negative ), which is less than 1.

Wait, but in the calculation I did,

ΔE/(k) = (hc/(lambda k )) )

Which is correct.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )

Let me compute this step by step.

h*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by lambda (1448e-10 m) and k (1.38e-23 J/K):

ΔE/(k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10 m) ) / (1.38e-23 J/K )

Wait, wait. Wait, ΔE is hc/lambda, so:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1448e-10 m) ) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Then, ΔE/(k) = 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K ≈ 9950 K.

Wait, that's about 9950 K. Hmm, earlier I thought it was ~1e5 K, but now I get ~1e4 K.

Wait, 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 /1.38 ) * 1e5 ≈ 0.995 * 1e5 = 9.95e4 K.

Ah, no, wait, 1e-18 / 1e-23 = 1e5. So 9.95e4 K is correct.

So back to the exponent:

ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T_spot) = 9.95e4 K * (1/6000 - 1/4311) K^-1.

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667, 1/4311 ≈ 0.000232.

Difference: 0.000166667 - 0.000232 = -0.000065333.

Multiply by 9.95e4:

-0.000065333 * 9.95e4 = -6.508e0 → approx -6.508.

So,

exp(-6.508) ≈ ?

We can compute this as:

exp(-6) ≈ 0.002478752,

exp(-6.5) = exp(-6) * exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.002478752 * 0.60653066 ≈ 0.001505.

exp(-6.508) ≈ approximately 0.0015.

So R_spot = R1 * 0.0015.

Then,

R2 = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 * 0.0015 R1 = 0.6 R1 + 0.0006 R1 = 0.6006 R1.

Thus,

R1 / R2 = 1 / 0.6006 ≈ 1.665.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the entire photosphere to be at the effective temperature of 5500 K.

So when spots are present, the temperature used is 5500 K, not a mix.

If that's the case, then R2 would be (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k *5500) ), and R1 is (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k *6000) ).

So the ratio R1/R2 is exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4,

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4.

Difference: 1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4 = -1.515e-5.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) = 9.95e4 K.

So,

9.95e4 * (-1.515e-5) = -1.507e0 → approx -1.507.

So,

exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221.

So,

R1/R2 = 1 / 0.221 ≈ 4.52.

Which is close to option C) ~4.5.

This would make the factor approximately 4.5.

But why would the problem assume that the photosphere is at 5500 K when it's a mix of two regions?

Ah, perhaps the question is considering that the observed ratio is based on the average temperature, not the local temperatures. But the problem statement says the photosphere is in LTE, which would imply that each region is in its own LTE.

Hmm, but this leads to two different approaches, one giving a factor of ~1.67 and the other ~4.5.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. But the photosphere itself is not at 5500 K—it's a mix of cooler and hotter regions.

But the problem asks about the ratio of Ti atoms in the photosphere. If the photosphere is a mix, then the observed ratio would be a weighted average of the two regions. But this seems to give a factor of ~1.67, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K, so the ratio is based on that. But that's not in LTE; each region is in LTE, but the overall is an average.

So perhaps the intended approach is to compute using T=5500 K.

But why?

Wait, perhaps the question is misworded, and the effective temperature is the temperature used for the ratio. So when the star has spots, the entire photosphere is treated as being at 5500 K for the purpose of the ratio.

In that case, the factor would be R1/R2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Compute the exponent:

(1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -1.515e-5.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) = 9.95e4 K.

So,

9.95e4 * (-1.515e-5) = -1.507.

So,

exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221.

Thus, R1/R2 = 1/0.221 ≈4.52.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

But this would mean that the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, which contradicts the LTE assumption. Unless the problem is simplifying the scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me think again.

In the first approach, when considering the photosphere as a mix of two regions, R2 ≈ 0.6 R1, leading to a factor of ~1.67, but there's no such option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_spot.

Wait, perhaps I should use the factor without considering the area weighting. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the ratio N1/N2 in the entire photosphere, which would be a combined effect of the two regions.

But let me think about the math again.

R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R_spot = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spot) )

So,

R1/R_spot = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_spot - 1/T1) )

Wait, no: R1/R_spot = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T_spot) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_spot -1/T1 ) )

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T_spot - 1/T1) )

With T_spot =4311 K, T1=6000 K.

So,

1/T_spot = 1/4311 ≈0.000232,

1/T1=0.00016667,

Difference: 0.000232-0.00016667=0.00006533.

Multiply by ΔE/(k)=9.95e4 K → 9.95e4 * 0.00006533 ≈6.48.

So R1/R_spot= exp(6.48)≈ 641. So R_spot= R1 / 641 ≈0.00156 R1.

Then, R2 = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 * 0.00156 R1 = 0.6 R1 + 0.000624 R1 ≈0.600624 R1.

Thus, R1/R2≈1.664.

But that's not an option.

So perhaps the intended approach is to use T=5500 K.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the average temperature is 5500 K, so when the star has spots, the ratio is based on T=5500 K.

In that case, R1/R2= exp(ΔE/(k) (1/6000 -1/5500) )= exp(-1.507)=0.221.

Thus, R1/R2=1/0.221≈4.52.

Which matches option C.

Given that the options include C) ~4.5, and the problem mentions the effective temperature, perhaps that's the intended approach.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.


Astronomers are studying a star with a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (N1/N2) changes when the star transitions from being spotless to having spots. The ratio decreases when the star has spots, and the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels and Boltzmann Distribution**:  
   The ratio of populations in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:  
   \[
   \frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
   \]  
   where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

2. **Temperature Scenarios**:  
   - Without spots, the entire photosphere is at \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\).  
   - When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature drops to \(T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\).  

   The problem assumes that the photosphere is in LTE, meaning each region (spotted or unspotted) has its own temperature. However, the observed ratio \(N_1/N_2\) is a blend of contributions from the two regions.

3. **Simplified Approach**:  
   The problem simplifies the scenario by considering the entire photosphere to be at the effective temperature \(T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\) when spots are present. This allows the ratio to be computed using \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\) for the spotted case.

4. **Exponent Calculation**:  
   The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is related to the wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\) by \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light. Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The term \(\Delta E / k\) is then:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.95 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
   \]  

   The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right),
   \]  
   where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\). Substituting:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   Thus, the exponent becomes:  
   \[
   9.95 \times 10^4 \times (-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.507.
   \]  

5. **Ratio Calculation**:  
   The ratio of the populations without spots to with spots is:  
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(-1.507\right) \approx 0.221.
   \]  
   Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is:  
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{0.221} \approx 4.52.
   \]  

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**. This corresponds to option **C**.
