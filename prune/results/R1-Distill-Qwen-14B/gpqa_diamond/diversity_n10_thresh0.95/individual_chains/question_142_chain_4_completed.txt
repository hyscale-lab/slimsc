Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space from the options given.

Wait, what's a density matrix again? Oh right, a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projection operator, like |ψ><ψ|. But here, ρ is a mixture of |0> and |1> states.

So the given ρ is 1/2(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because a pure state would have ρ² = ρ, but for this, let me check: ρ squared would be (1/2)^2 (|0><0| + |1><1|)^2. But wait, |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors and commute, so ρ^2 = (1/4)(|0><0| + |1><1|), which is 1/4 times the same expression. So ρ^2 = (1/4)(ρ * 2), because the sum is |0><0| + |1><1| = I, but wait no, wait.

Wait, |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix for a single qubit. Because in two dimensions, |0> and |1> form an orthonormal basis, so their outer products add up to I. So the given ρ is (1/2) times I, the identity matrix.

Right, so ρ = I/2. Now, the density matrix for a single qubit can be represented in the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, mixed states inside.

In the Bloch vector representation, any state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector from the origin to a point in 3D space, and σ are the Pauli matrices. So the general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Comparing that to the given ρ, which is I/2, this would imply that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices are zero. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Wait, but what does that mean? I thought the completely mixed state is the maximally mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. So that makes sense because the density matrix is I/2. For a pure state like |0>, the density matrix would be |0><0|, which in Bloch vector terms would be (I + |0><0| - |1><1|)/2. Oh wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, the Bloch vector for |0> is along the +z axis. The state |0> is (I + σ_z)/2. So when you have a mixed state that's 50% |0> and 50% |1>, it would be (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is I/2. So the Bloch vector is zero, meaning it's at the origin. Because there's no coherence and it's equally likely in both states.

So the geometrical position in the qubits space is at the origin, which in the options is option C, r=(0,0,0).

Looking back at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → That can't be right because that would imply some x and y components.

B) (0,0,1) → That's the |0> state along z-axis.

C) (0,0,0) → Origin, the mixed state.

D) (1,1,1) → That's some point in all three dimensions, which doesn't fit.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any quantum state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), it simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are all zero, meaning the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This implies non-zero components in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, which is inconsistent with the given density matrix.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not the mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** This correctly represents the origin in the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** This implies non-zero components in all three directions, which is inconsistent with the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
