Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay channels.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh right, so that's the interaction term. The X field is a boson, and it's coupling to various fermions. So, the decay of X would involve it coupling to fermion-antifermion pairs.

But first, I should probably think about the general rules for particle decays. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion because each fermion would carry away some energy, and you need enough to create the pair. So, the condition is m_X ≥ 2 m_fermion.

Wait, but what's the mass of the boson X here? It's 6 GeV. So, I need to find all fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 /2 =3). Wait, but I should probably think about the masses of the standard model fermions in GeV.

Let me recall the masses of the known fermions. I think the up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV. Then the strange quark is about 100 MeV or so. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV, the bottom is about 4.5 GeV, and the top is super heavy, around 173 GeV. But wait, the top is way heavier than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks. 

Wait, but wait, let me get the exact numbers. Let's list them:

- Up quark: ~2.2 MeV (current algebra estimate)
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
- Strange: ~95 MeV
- Charm: ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.7 GeV
- Top: ~173 GeV
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV
- Others like neutrinos are negligible (almost massless)

So, for X to decay into fermions, the fermion mass must be ≤ 3 GeV. Because m_X is 6 GeV, so 6/2=3 GeV.

Looking at the fermions:

- Electron (0.0005 GeV): yes
- Muon (0.105 GeV): yes
- Tau (1.78 GeV): yes (since 1.78 <3)
- Up quark: yes
- Down: yes
- Strange: yes
- Charm: 1.3 GeV: yes
Wait, but bottom is 4.7 GeV. So 4.7 is larger than 3, so X can't decay into b quarks. Because 4.7*2=9.4 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV. Wait, no, wait. The mass of the fermion is m, so each pair requires 2m. So for a pair of b quarks, the required mass would be 2*4.7=9.4 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9.4, so X cannot decay into a b and anti-b.

Wait, but what about the tau? Tau is 1.78 GeV. So 2 *1.78 =3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so that's allowed. So X can decay into tau+tau-.

Same for mu and e: 2*0.105=0.21 GeV for mu, way below 6.

For quarks: up is 2.2 MeV, so 2 up quarks would be 4.4 MeV, which is way below 6 GeV. Same for down and strange. So X can decay into u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar.

Wait, but the charm quark is 1.3 GeV, so 2*1.3=2.6 GeV, which is less than 6, so X can decay into c c-bar as well.

But wait, how about the top quark? But top is 173 GeV, way heavier than 3 GeV, so no decay into top.

So possible fermion pairs are:

- e+ e-
- mu+ mu-
- tau+ tau-
- u u-bar
- d d-bar
- s s-bar
- c c-bar

Wait, but what about the bottom? Because 4.7 GeV is more than 3, so 2m is 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u, d d, tau pair, e pair. Hmm, but since m(b) is 4.7 GeV, 2m=9.4>6, so this decay is not allowed. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c c-bar, s s, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. So includes c, which is allowed because 2*1.3=2.6 <6. So B includes all except b and top. Wait, but what about the bottom in B? No, option B doesn't have b. Let me check. Option B is c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed except for b and top. So B is a possible correct option.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But top is way too heavy, so t is not allowed. So C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is 4.7 GeV, so 2m=9.4>6, so decay into b-bar is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, what about the possibility of X decaying into a pair where one is b and the other is another quark? No, because the Lagrangian given is written as X coupling to each fermion. The problem says "The interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So, I think X can only decay into each fermion-antifermion pair for each type that it couples to. So, for each possible fermion f, X can decay into f and f-bar, provided the mass condition is satisfied.

So, looking back, the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. So which option lists all these? Let's look:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes.

Wait, but option C includes t, which is not allowed. So the correct option must include all the allowed fermion pairs, which are the e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Looking at the options:

A) includes b, which is not allowed. So A is out.

B) includes all allowed except for, wait option B lists: X→c c, s s, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. So that's exactly the allowed ones. So B is a candidate.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So no.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the decay modes are given as X→ something. So in the Lagrangian, the interaction term is -λ_f f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, so this term is for each fermion f. So X couples to each fermion f, allowing decay into f f-bar. So for each fermion f that X couples to, if 2m_f ≤ m_X, then the decay is allowed.

But wait, what about the other fermions, like the neutrinos? Neutrinos have very small masses, but the problem doesn't list their decay channels. The options don't include them, so I suppose we can ignore them for this problem.

So, the possible decay channels are e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Looking at the options, only option B includes all of these except for b and top.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian and the mass constraints. The Lagrangian describes the coupling of \( X \) to fermions, allowing decays of \( X \) into fermion-antifermion pairs. The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV, so the fermion mass \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of standard model fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Therefore, \( X \) can decay into the following pairs:
- \( e^+ e^- \)
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( u \bar{u} \)
- \( d \bar{d} \)
- \( s \bar{s} \)
- \( c \bar{c} \)

Decays into \( b \bar{b} \) or \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Now, we evaluate the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B
