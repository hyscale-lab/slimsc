Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these. 

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) with higher-dimensional operators. These operators are added to the SM Lagrangian, right? And when you add these operators, they have to maintain certain symmetries.

First, what's the deal with Poincare symmetry? I think Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, the Poincare group is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. So if the theory has Poincare symmetry, it automatically includes Lorentz symmetry. But wait, SMEFT is built from the SM, which already respects Poincare. So do the operators in SMEFT also respect Poincare symmetry?

I remember that all terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant. Because otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense—it wouldn't have the right symmetries for a relativistic field theory. So that means operators must be Lorentz scalar, and also their terms are translation invariant. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are respected.

What about CP symmetry? I think that's a different story. CP is charge conjugation plus parity. The SM doesn't respect CP, right? Like, CP violation is a known phenomenon in the SM, especially in the CKM matrix. So if the SM already violates CP, then the SMEFT operators should allow for CP violation too. Wait, but the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So if some operators violate CP, then CP isn't a symmetry that must be respected. So not all operators have to respect CP symmetry.

Wait no, maybe the point is that the SMEFT must preserve certain symmetries, and whether operators can violate them. Hmm. Or perhaps the question is which symmetries are automatically respected because of the way the SMEFT is constructed. Because SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the SM, which itself doesn't have CP symmetry. So I think the operators may or may not respect CP symmetry. So the symmetry isn't necessarily required for the operators. So option 3, CP, might not be a must.

Then there's CPT symmetry. The SM respects CPT. Because CPT is a big deal; in quantum field theory, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT. So if the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT. Because CPT is a combination of C, P, and T. So I think the SMEFT respects CPT symmetry. So all the operators must respect CPT.

So putting it together: the operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) because those are part of the structure of the theory. And they must respect CPT (4), because that's a consequence of Lorentz invariance. But they don't have to respect CP (3) because the SM doesn't, so SMEFT allows for CP violation.

Looking at the options, which ones include 1,2, and 4? Option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. So the correct choice would be C.

Wait, another thought: does SMEFT actually require Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. The SM Lagrangian is already Poincare invariant, so the higher-dimension operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars and are local, so they preserve Poincare. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 1 and 2 are both required.

So including 1,2,4, that's option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect certain symmetries to maintain the consistency of the theory. Let us analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic theory, and all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic field theory, so Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is built as a relativistic theory, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The SM already violates CP symmetry (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT allows for CP-violating operators. Thus, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Any Lorentz-invariant theory, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry for all operators.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1,2,4
