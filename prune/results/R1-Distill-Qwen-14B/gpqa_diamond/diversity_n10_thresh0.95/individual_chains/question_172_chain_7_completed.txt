Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to work through this.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, and both photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that probably means we can use some standard thermodynamic equations here.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think the excitation of atoms in a star depends on the temperature. Maybe it's related to the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation, right! It describes the population of particles in different energy states.

The Boltzmann factor is something like n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i is the number of particles in state i, n_j in state j, E the energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature. Oh wait, but wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher there.

So let's model this. Let me denote the energy levels as E_1 and E_2, but wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's say E_2 is higher than E_1 by delta E. So delta E = E_2 - E_1 = 1.38e-23 J.

In star_1, the number of excited atoms (say in E_2) is twice that of star_2. So n_2,1 / n_1,1 = 2. Wait no, wait, the problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe n_2,1 is twice n_2,2? Or perhaps the ratio is different.

Wait, perhaps the excitation is the ratio of the higher energy level to the lower one. So for star 1, n1_2 / n1_1 = 2. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the number in the excited state is twice that in the lower state. Or perhaps it's the ratio between the two stars. Hmm, not sure. Let me think about what the problem says again.

The problem states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think that for each star, the ratio between the excited state and the ground state (or another state) is given. So for star 1, the number in the excited state is twice as much as in star 2's excited state, or perhaps compared to their own lower state.

Wait no, I think it's the ratio between the two stars. So, the ratio for star_1 is (n2/n1) = 2, and for star_2 it's (n2'/n1') = something else. But I'm not quite sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So let's model it.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's denote for each star, the ratio of the number of excited atoms (n_upper) to the number in the lower energy level (n_lower). For star_1, this ratio is R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1. For star_2, it's R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2.

The problem says that R1 is twice as much as R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, actually, the problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe R1 = 2 * R2? Or perhaps R1 = 2. Because the question says "twice as excited", so perhaps R1 = 2. Hmm, a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2). Wait, that's not what the problem says. The problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the ratio of n_upper in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But then, what's the denominator? Maybe the same energy level in each star. Wait, perhaps for each star, the ratio is their own n_upper to their own n_lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the energy difference is the same for both stars, but the excitation (i.e., the ratio of populations) is different.

Well, perhaps the key is to relate the excitation ratio to the temperature.

So for each star, the ratio n_upper / n_lower is given by the Boltzmann factor: exp( -delta_E/(k T) )

Wait, because E_upper > E_lower, the exponent is negative, so the ratio is less than 1. So, the higher the temperature, the larger the ratio.

So, for star_1, ratio R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( -delta_E/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, R2 = exp( -delta_E/(k T2) )

The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, no. The problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, but R1 and R2 are both ratios of excited to lower. So if star_1 has a higher excitation, that would imply a higher temperature, because higher T would give a higher ratio.

Because exp( -delta_E/(k T)) increases as T increases, since the denominator is bigger, so the exponent is less negative. So when T is higher, the ratio is higher.

So R1 = exp( -delta_E/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -delta_E/(k T2) )

Given that R1 = 2 * R2.

So substituting,

exp( -delta_E/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -delta_E/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -delta_E/(k T2) ):

exp( delta_E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take natural log of both sides:

delta_E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me compute that.

Wait, let's think about 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So,

delta_E/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2) ) / (delta_E )

But the problem gives delta_E = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, wait, 1.38e-23 J is actually k_B * 1 eV, I think. Wait, no, 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 1.38e-23 J is much smaller. Wait, perhaps delta_E is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, substituting delta_E = 1.38e-23 J.

But the problem isn't asking for the actual temperatures, but which equation is correct for the relation between T1 and T2.

So, looking at the options, let's see.

We have that (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2) ) / delta_E.

But none of the options directly have this. Let me check the options.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Wait, but our equation is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2))/delta_E. So unless k and delta_E are in a ratio that gives a 1, which is not the case here. So perhaps I made a mistake in my setup.

Wait another approach. Let's write the ratios again.

R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( -delta_E/(k T1) )

R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2 = exp( -delta_E/(k T2) )

The problem says that R1 = 2 * R2.

So,

exp( -delta_E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -delta_E/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -delta_E/(k T2) ) gives:

exp( delta_E/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

delta_E/(k) ( (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

delta_E/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / delta_E

But the options don't include any k or delta_E terms. So perhaps the given delta_E is equal to k * something, like delta_E = k * (something), because 1.38e-23 J is the same as k * (0.0000000000000000000000138) which is a very small value. Wait, no, k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait! So delta_E is given as 1.38e-23 J. And k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So delta_E = k * something. Let's compute delta_E/k. delta_E = 1.38e-23 J, k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta_E / k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So delta_E/k = 1 K.

So our equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / delta_E = (k * ln(2) ) / (k * (1 K) )) )

Wait, no, because delta_E = k * (something), which is 1 K. So delta_E = k * (1 K).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-calculate.

Given delta_E = 1.38e-23 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So delta_E = k * (1 J/(1.38e-23 J/K)) )? No, wait, no. Let me compute delta_E/k.

delta_E/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah! So delta_E/k = 1 K.

So substituting back into our equation:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k * ln(2)) / delta_E

Wait, but delta_E = k * (1 K), so:

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / (k * 1 K )

The k cancels, and 1 K in the denominator:

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( ln(2) ) / 1

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (denoted as \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \)) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_{\text{upper}} \) and \( n_{\text{lower}} \) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of populations are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting this into the equations:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The problem specifies \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the equation in option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct relationship between the effective temperatures is given by option D.

Answer: D
