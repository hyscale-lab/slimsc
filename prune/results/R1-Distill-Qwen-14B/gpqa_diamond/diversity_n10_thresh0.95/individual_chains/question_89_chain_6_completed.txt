--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully and break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me try to visualize the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, right? So, it's a four-fused cyclohexane ring system. The 1,3-dibromo would mean there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So, two Br atoms on adjacent carbons would eliminate as Br- and form a double bond. The product here is a light yellow solid, which might be due to the formation of an alkene, maybe. The NMR data for product 1 is given.

Looking at the NMR spectrum of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but after elimination, I thought it would form an alkene. But IR shows a carbonyl, which doesn't fit. Did I miss something?

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Another possibility is that the dibromide could undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but how? Oh, wait, wait. I'm confusing the reactions. Vicinal dihalides can also undergo intramolecular elimination if possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? Or perhaps it's a di-elimination leading to a ketone.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have a vicinal dihalide, using a strong base can lead to double elimination, forming an alkene. But if the base is in excess and heat is applied, maybe it can form a diepoxide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. Wait, but how would that happen?

Wait, could it be a pinacol-like elimination? No, pinacol rearrangement typically involves diols. Another thought: If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is symmetric, perhaps upon elimination, it forms an adamantyl group with a ketone. Oh, wait, maybe the elimination produces an allene or something else, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps instead of elimination, it's a substitution. But KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution reactions typically. Unless it's a SN2, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has a very rigid structure, making SN2 unlikely because of steric hindrance. So elimination seems more plausible.

Wait, but then why is there a carbonyl? Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but oxidation. Wait, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, so when KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the electrons form a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form an alkene. But wait, that would form an alkene somewhere, but the NMR of product 1 shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm. That's around where vinyl protons might appear, but in adamantane derivatives, the protons are usually more downfield due to the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, like a ketone.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with KOH, maybe it's a double elimination, leading to the formation of a ketone. How?

Wait, another possibility: The base could abstract a beta hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to two elimination steps. If both Brs are eliminated as Br-, perhaps forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR. Alternatively, perhaps each Br leads to a carbocation, but that's unlikely under basic conditions.

Wait, perhaps it's a more complex elimination. Since the molecule is symmetric, maybe the two Br atoms are on carbons that are each adjacent to a bridgehead. So, elimination would form a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule. Oh, right! Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds are not possible in bicyclic systems unless the ring is large enough, like in norbornene. Adamantane has four rings, so it's a larger system. So maybe a bridgehead double bond is possible here.

So, if the initial product is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond, what's the structure? Let's say the double bond is between C1 and C2 in the structure. Then, perhaps during the reaction, the two Brs are eliminated to form a double bond, leading to adamantylene or similar.

But then, the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm off. Another possibility is that each Br is replaced by an OH group. Wait, but under strong basic conditions, substitution with OH is unlikely. Unless it's an elimination followed by something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR peak more. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, possibly from a ketone or an ester. But in the product, since we started with a dihalide and used KOH, which is a base, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination leads to a carbonyl. How? Perhaps each elimination forms an alkene, but in such a way that the structure becomes a ketone. That doesn't seem straightforward.

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugate elimination leading to a ketone. Let me imagine the structure: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH would abstract a beta hydrogen from each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond and elimination of HBr. But if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, the elimination could lead to a bridgehead double bond, which is possible in adamantane. Alternatively, perhaps the base causes the formation of an alkoxide, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another idea: Maybe each Br is on a carbon that, when eliminated, forms a carbonyl group. How? Let me think about the mechanism. If each Br is on a carbon that can lose a hydrogen, forming a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But the IR would show a strong peak for C=O, but the NMR doesn't show any obvious ketone carbonyl protons because they're usually deshielded. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm is 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or an ester, but in this case, maybe an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a C=O peak. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR. The product 1 has an NMR with a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). That might be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an epoxide. But the IR doesn't support that. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. But then the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the product as a ketone. Suppose the product is 1,3-adamantanedione. But then, the NMR would likely show some deshielded protons near the carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring opening or something else.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the subsequent reactions. Product 1 is treated with excess Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid catalyst. Al isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the Al isopropoxide would help in some alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but let's get back. The first step: what is product 1?

Let me think about the structure again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with KOH, perhaps both Br atoms are eliminated as Br- and form a double bond. Because KOH is a strong base, it would promote elimination (E2 mechanism). Since the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those carbons.

So, the product would be 1,3-diene adamantane? No, because in adamantane, the structure is such that those positions are bridgeheads. Wait, but I thought bridgehead double bonds are not allowed. However, in adamantane's structure, the bridgehead carbons are part of a four-membered ring. According to Bredt's rule, bridgehead double bonds are allowed only in systems where the bridge has more than two carbons, or in cases where the structure is such that the ring strain is manageable. Adamantane's structure is fused in a way that a bridgehead double bond would be possible because the molecule is highly strained otherwise?

Wait, perhaps the double bond is not at the bridgehead but elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a ketone. Wait, another idea: Maybe each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a methyl group, and elimination leads to a carbonyl. For example, if a Br is on a CH2 group, and elimination of HBr forms a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a double elimination. Let's say each Br is on a central carbon, and elimination of two HBr molecules forms a ketone. So, the central CH2Br2 would lose two HBr to become a C=O. Wait, but that would require a central CH2Br2, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is on two separate bridgehead carbons.

Hmm. Maybe I should sketch the structure.

Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgehead carbons. So each has a Br.

So, when KOH is added, each Br will eliminate. Each elimination would form a double bond. But wait, each elimination would require abstracting a β-H from the adjacent carbon. Since it's a bridgehead, the β-Hs might be available.

So, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? No, wait, each Br is on C1 and C3. So, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination would form a double bond on each adjacent bridge, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe each Br is on a carbon that is connected to a bridge, and elimination forms a ketone by losing HBr from each.

Wait, if each Br is on a CH2 group, then eliminating HBr from each would form a carbonyl. So, for example, two CH2Br groups become two C=O groups. But that would require two carbons, each adjacent to Br, losing H and Br to form a carbonyl. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Brs are on bridgehead carbons, each connected to three other carbons. So, each Br is on a bridgehead which is connected to three other bridgeheads. So, each bridgehead has three CH groups.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon that, upon elimination, forms a carbonyl group. Let me think about the structure. Suppose each Br is on a carbon that is connected to two other bridgehead carbons and a CH2 group. No, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination of two HBr molecules results in the formation of a ketone via a conjugated di-elimination. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Wait, maybe the product is not an alkene but a diketone. So, each Br is replaced by a carbonyl. But that would require two carbonyl groups in the molecule.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a single ketone. Wait, but how? If two Brs are eliminated, perhaps they are eliminated in a way that forms a single carbonyl group. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a ketone, and the NMR and IR data support that. The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, but in a ketone, the protons adjacent would not necessarily be a triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is from an alcohol group. But then the IR would have a broad peak around 3300 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned. So that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the product is not a ketone but an epoxide. Epoxides have protons around δ 3.5-4.5 ppm. The triplet at 4.79 could be from an epoxide. But the IR of an epoxide typically shows a strong peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ and 1050 cm⁻¹ due to the C-O-C stretching. The given IR is at 1720 cm⁻¹, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the second reaction. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So, product 1 must have an aromatic ring or something that can undergo electrophilic substitution. But wait, adamantane is a fused ring system, not aromatic. So, unless product 1 is a ketone which can act as an electrophile.

Wait, product 1 could be a ketone, so when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some alkylation. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkene, and under Friedel-Crafts conditions, it could undergo some addition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is the result of some reaction. But I'm not making progress here.

Let me think about the third step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, leading to product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So, product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis is a reaction of alkenes.

So, product 2 must contain a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that double bond into smaller fragments, each with a carbonyl group.

So, working backwards: product 3 is the result of ozonolysis of product 2. Product 2 has a double bond. Product 1 is the starting material for product 2, which came from treating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. So, product 1 must have some functionality that reacts with Al isopropoxide to form an alkene.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed via a conjugate addition or some elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, then Al isopropoxide may not react directly. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. After ozonolysis, product 3's NMR is to be considered. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those exchanging with D2O). So, what kind of structure would have a hydrogen with a particular coupling pattern.

In ozonolysis, the alkene is cleaved, and each resulting fragment has carbonyl groups. If the alkene was symmetric, the ozonolysis would give two identical fragments. The coupling in the NMR would depend on the neighboring protons.

So, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it deshielded. Its coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring groups.

Wait, in the ozonolysis product, each end would have a carbonyl. So, perhaps the hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl and has two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. Or maybe it's coupled with two sets of protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diol or a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. If the alkene in product 2 is between two identical groups, then ozonolysis would produce two identical carbonyl compounds. So, the NMR of product 3 would show symmetric peaks.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to figure out what each step does.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1.

Assuming elimination, product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene (but I'm not sure about the structure). But the IR has a carbonyl, which contradicts. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the elimination forms a cyclopropane. No, that doesn't explain the IR.

Alternatively, the product could be a bromoalkene, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a geminal diol. No, that would require substitution, which isn't favored under basic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would require a strong acid, not a base. Plus, the IR would show a broad peak around 3300, which isn't mentioned.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the IR again. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. That suggests a ketone or an aldehyde. But in the structure of product 1 from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps a ketone is formed.

Wait, maybe the starting material undergoes a double elimination, where two HBr molecules are lost, forming a ketone. Let me think: Each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, so eliminating both would form a carbonyl group. For example, think of 1,2-dibromoethane eliminating to form ethylene. But in adamantane's case, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, and elimination forms a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, that's possible. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form 1,3-adamantanedione? No, that would require each Br to be on adjacent bridgeheads, but in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the positions are bridgeheads separated by one carbon? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 1-adamantanone. But how? If both Brs are eliminated from a single carbon, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a single carbonyl group. For example, each Br is on a CH2 group attached to the bridgehead, and elimination forms a C=O.

Wait, but bridgeheads can't have CH2 groups because they're part of the fused rings. So each bridgehead must be a CH group attached to three other carbons.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and the NMR shows the adjacent CH2 groups. Let's say product 1 is 1-adamantanone. The NMR would then show the protons adjacent to the carbonyl. In such a case, the protons on the CH2 groups adjacent to the ketone would be around δ 2.1-2.4, which matches the 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) in product 1's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2O group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ would fit a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone, maybe 1-adamantanone.

Then, product 1 is 1-adamantanone. The next step is treating it with excess Al isopropoxide. What reaction occurs here? Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, so perhaps it facilitates the formation of an enol or enolate.

But 1-adamantanone is a bulky ketone. Alternatively, Al isopropoxide could help in some Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but 1-adamantanone isn't aromatic. Alternatively, maybe the ketone undergoes some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, another possibility: The ketone could undergo a Claisen or aldol condensation under acidic conditions. But without a base, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is converted to an enol ether, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane. No, that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, product 1 is a diene, leading to product 2 via some addition, but I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → epoxide. How? Epoxides are formed from dihalides via oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps via an elimination to form an alkene, but that doesn't lead to an epoxide.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but again, that doesn't fit the IR.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should move to the next part.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to one, possibly with coupling to neighboring protons.

But to find the coupling pattern, I need to know the structure around that hydrogen.

Wait, in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each fragment has carbonyl groups. For example, if the double bond was between carbons A and B, then each fragment would have a carbonyl at A and B, respectively.

The hydrogen's coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens. If the hydrogen is next to a CH2 group, it might couple with two protons, leading to a triplet. Or if it's next to a CH group with two hydrogens, it might be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the structure of product 2's double bond would determine this.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, perhaps a symmetric one, so when ozonolyzed, each fragment is the same. So the NMR would show symmetry.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to determine.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is a methine (CH) group adjacent to two CH2 groups, leading to coupling with two sets of protons.

Wait, for example, if the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=CH-CH2-CHO, then each end would have a carbonyl. The middle CH2 would have protons that are split by neighboring groups.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is at the end, adjacent to a carbonyl, and coupled to two equivalent protons, resulting in a triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogen is adjacent to a CH2 group, which has two protons. So each of those would split the signal into a triplet. But if there are two neighboring groups, it might be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, the question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which would likely be near the carbonyl group.

In ketones, the alpha protons (next to carbonyl) are usually deshielded and split based on neighboring groups.

So, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', the protons on the CH2 next to the CO would each be split by the neighboring CH2. Each of those protons would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. But if there are two different neighboring groups, perhaps the splitting would be more complex.

Alternatively, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CHO, then the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each be coupled with the two adjacent CH2 protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, if the alkene is in the center, the resulting products would have carbonyl groups on each end. So, each carbonyl is at the end of a chain.

Suppose the alkene in product 2 is between two CH2 groups. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. Each fragment would be R-CO- and -CO-R'. But if product 2's alkene is in a symmetric position, the fragments would be the same.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an adamantyl compound with an exocyclic double bond. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms two equivalent carbonyl groups.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to predict.

Wait, back to product 1. The NMR has 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests multiple CH2 groups in a rigid structure, perhaps the adamantane framework. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, and the 4.79 (2H) could be another CH2 group, maybe part of an ether or ester.

Wait, could product 1 be an epoxide? Then, the 4.79 ppm would be the epoxide's CH2. But the IR doesn't show the C-O-C stretch, which is around 1250 cm⁻¹, so that's a problem.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, but without the correct IR.

Hmm. Maybe product 1 is a hemiacetal or some oxygen-containing compound, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm peak is from something else, like an OH group. But the IR doesn't show OH stretch.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is from a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a gem-diol, but that's unlikely under basic conditions.

I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should look at the answer options and think about what coupling patterns they represent.

The options are:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

A triplet implies coupling with two equivalent protons. A triplet of triplets would mean coupling with two sets of protons, each giving a triplet. A doublet of triplets suggests coupling with two different sets, each with two protons. A pentet (five peaks) would result from coupling with four equivalent protons.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen is probably adjacent to two different sets of protons, each with two protons, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if it's adjacent to a CH2 group, which has two protons, and perhaps another adjacent group, like another CH2, then it might be a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'm speculating.

Wait, if the hydrogen is next to a CH2 group and also next to another CH2 group, each with two protons, then each coupling would split the peak. For example, a CH2-CH2-CH2 group: the middle CH2 would be a triplet of triplets. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the hydrogen is adjacent to a CH group with two protons, that would cause a triplet. But if it's also coupled with another set of two protons, it becomes a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis has a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is connected to another CH2 group. So, the most deshielded hydrogen (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would be split by the adjacent CH2 (two protons) and possibly another group. If there's another coupling, it could lead to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CO- group, where the CH2 is next to CO and another CH2, leading to coupling with two sets of two protons each, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain. Given the options, and the possible structures, I'm leaning towards option B) triplet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: The hydrogen is part of a -CH2-CH2- group next to a carbonyl. The first CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there's another coupling, perhaps from another adjacent group, it might become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is part of a -CH2- group next to a carbonyl and also next to a CH group with two protons, leading to a triplet of triplets.

I'm not 100% sure, but considering the options and the possible structures, I think the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step involves heating the compound with KOH, leading to a product (product 1) with a light yellow solid, an IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, and an NMR spectrum with peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. The NMR data supports this, with the 4.79 ppm peak possibly corresponding to a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, and the 2.41-2.23 ppm peak corresponding to CH₂ groups in the rigid adamantane framework.

The second step involves treating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitating a reaction that introduces a double bond, forming product 2. This is inferred because product 2 undergoes ozonolysis in the third step, which specifically reacts with alkenes.

In the third step, ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C followed by dimethyl sulfide cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically produces carbonyl-containing fragments. The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, which is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group due to its deshielded nature.

The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons. If the hydrogen is adjacent to two sets of non-equivalent protons, such as two CH₂ groups, it would exhibit a triplet of triplets due to coupling with two protons from each set. This pattern arises when the hydrogen is influenced by two distinct coupling constants.

Given the options:

- **A) Triplet**: Results from coupling with two equivalent protons.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: Results from coupling with two sets of non-equivalent protons.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: Results from coupling with two different sets of protons, one set providing a doublet and the other a triplet.
- **D) Pentet**: Results from coupling with four equivalent protons.

The most plausible scenario is that the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to two CH₂ groups, leading to a triplet of triplets due to coupling with two protons from each CH₂ group. This matches the expected splitting pattern for such a structure.

Answer: B
