Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty for E2. 

Wait, but what's the total uncertainty in the energy difference between E1 and E2? Hmm, I think when considering the energy difference, it's the uncertainty in each state that contributes. So the total uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, because for each state, their energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. Or maybe I should think about the uncertainty in the difference, which would be the maximum of the two? Or perhaps the sum? 

Wait, no, actually, the energy difference is E2 - E1. The uncertainty in that difference would be ΔE2 + ΔE1, because if E2 is uncertain by ΔE2 and E1 by ΔE1, their difference's uncertainty is the combination. Because when you subtract two independent uncertainties, the maximum possible is the sum. So ΔE_diff ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So plugging in the numbers: 6.56e-7 eV + 6.56e-8 eV. Let's see, 6.56e-7 is 65.6e-8, adding 6.56e-8 gives us about 72.16e-8 eV. So roughly 7.2e-7 eV. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's exactly correct. Another thought: perhaps the energy difference's uncertainty is the smaller of the two, because if the lifetimes are different, the more precise measurement comes from the longer lifetime. Or wait, no. Each state's lifetime contributes to the uncertainty of their own energy. So when considering the difference, the uncertainty in the difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because each energy has its own uncertainty, and when you take the difference, the maximum possible uncertainty is the sum. So I think that's correct.

So for the energy difference ΔE to be clearly distinguishable, it should be greater than the uncertainty in ΔE. So ΔE > ΔE_diff. 

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than 7.2e-7 eV. Let's look at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way less than 7e-7. So too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 7e-7. So that's way bigger than the uncertainty. So yes, definitely distinguishable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. Hmm, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7. The required ΔE is about 7.2e-7, which is 7.2e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller, so not enough.

Wait, but wait, the options given are: 

C is 1e-4 eV, which is much bigger than our calculated uncertainty. So that would mean that the energy difference is clearly distinguishable. So the correct answer is C. 

But wait, let me think again. Wait, the question is about which energy difference would allow the two levels to be clearly resolved. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty. So the correct answer is the one where the energy difference is greater than the uncertainty. 

In our case, the uncertainty is about 7.2e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than that would suffice. Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is 0.001e-6, which is 1e-9. Less than 7.2e-7. So no.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 7e-7. So yes, clearly bigger.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV. 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is less than 7e-7. So no.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait another thought: isn't the uncertainty in the energy difference the sum of the two uncertainties? So yes, because E2 has a larger lifetime (1e-8 s), so its energy uncertainty is smaller. Wait, no, because longer lifetimes mean lower energy uncertainty. Because higher Δt (lifetime) leads to lower ΔE.

Wait, let me recalculate. For E1, which has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s), ΔE1 is higher. Because ΔE = ħ / Δt. So with shorter Δt, higher ΔE. So for E1, ΔE1 is 1e-34 /1e-9 =1e-25 J, which is about 6.25e-7 eV. For E2, longer lifetime, 1e-8 s, ΔE2 is 1e-26 J, 6.25e-8 eV. So the sum is 6.25e-7 + 6.25e-8 = 6.875e-7 eV. So about 6.87e-7 eV uncertainty in the energy difference.

So the energy difference must be larger than 6.87e-7 eV. So let's check each option:

A) 1e-9 → 1e-9 eV is 0.001e-6 eV, which is 0.001 * 1e-6 eV. 1e-9 is 0.001e-6, but wait, 1e-9 is 0.001 * 1e-6, meaning 0.001 micro-eV. Which is way less than 6.87e-7 eV (which is 0.687 micro-eV). So no.

B) 1e-11 eV is 0.01 * 1e-10 → even smaller than A.

C)1e-4 eV is 100 micro-eV. 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.87e-7. So yes, the energy difference is clearly distinguishable.

D)1e-8 eV is 0.01 micro-eV. 1e-8 is 0.01e-6 eV, which is 0.01 micro-eV. Which is less than 6.87e-7 eV (0.687 micro-eV). So no.

So the only option that's larger is C. So the answer is C.


To determine the energy difference that allows the two quantum states to be clearly distinguished, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in time (Δt) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, the lifetimes (Δt) of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The uncertainty in energy for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} = E_2 - E_1 \) is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the energy difference \( \Delta E \) to be clearly distinguishable, it must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is not sufficient.

Thus, the only energy difference that allows the two states to be clearly distinguished is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
