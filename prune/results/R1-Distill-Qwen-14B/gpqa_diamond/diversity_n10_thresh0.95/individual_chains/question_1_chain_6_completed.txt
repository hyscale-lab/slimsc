Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties, the peaks won't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required ΔE is the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe the larger uncertainty. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), because the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in the context of this question, each state has its own line width. So for state 1, the line width (full width at half maximum) is proportional to 1/τ1, and similarly for state 2.

So the two lines (from E1 and E2) must be spaced apart by more than the sum of their line widths to be distinguishable. Because if they're too close, their spectral lines might overlap and you can't tell them apart.

So the minimal energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of the line widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2) for the two states.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be greater than the maximum of the two line widths. Because if ΔE is larger than the maximum line width, then probably they are resolvable.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the formula again. The natural line width is given by the uncertainty principle. The energy uncertainty is approximately ħ/(τ), so the line width is about 2π times that, maybe, but perhaps the question is using a simplified version.

Wait, let's compute the uncertainties for each state.

First, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are given in eV, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV·seconds.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So ħ in eV·s would be ħ * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE = ħ/(2τ). But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, it's approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. Because maybe the 2 is negligible, or the exact factor isn't needed for the order of magnitude.

So for state 1, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

For state 2, τ2 = 1e-8 s. ΔE2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the line widths are about 6.6e-7 eV for E1 and 6.6e-8 eV for E2.

To resolve the two states, their energy difference ΔE must be greater than the sum of their line widths. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the lines would overlap.

So the minimal ΔE is approximately ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.6e-7 + 6.6e-8 = 7.26e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV: 0.001 n eV, way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV: even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV: 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV. That's larger than our sum of 7.26e-7 eV (which is about 0.726e-6 eV). Because 1e-4 is 100 times bigger than 1e-6. So 1e-4 is much larger than 7e-7, so that's sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV: 0.00000001 eV. That's about 0.014 times the sum (since 7e-7 is 70e-8), so it's way smaller than needed.

So the minimal required ΔE is around 7e-7 eV, but looking at the options, the closest higher value is option C, 1e-4 eV. Because 1e-4 is much bigger than 7e-7.

Wait but wait a minute, wait. Let me recheck. Because 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 100,000 times larger than 1e-9 eV (option A). So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than our required 7e-7 eV. So that would mean that option C is a possible correct answer.

But wait, why is option C higher than what is needed? Because the question is about "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So any energy difference larger than the sum of the uncertainties would work. So 1e-4 eV is much larger than 7e-7 eV, so it's sufficient.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because ΔE1 is 6.5e-7 eV, which is 6.5e-7 eV, which is 650e-8 eV. Option D is 1e-8 eV, so much smaller than 650e-8. So if ΔE is 1e-8 eV, that's less than the line width of E1, which is 6.5e-7 eV. So the lines would overlap, so you can't resolve them. So options A and B are even smaller, so worse.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than the sum of the line widths, so that would definitely allow you to see two distinct peaks.

Wait, but why is option D 1e-8 eV? That's the same order as the line width of E2. Hmm, I think if the energy difference is about equal to the line width, their peaks might just barely be distinguishable. But I'm not sure. Maybe the rule of thumb is that the energy difference should be much larger than the larger line width.

Wait, in the case of E1, the line width is 6.5e-7 eV, which is larger than the line width of E2, which is 6.5e-8 eV.

So to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the line width of E1. Because if it's just a bit larger than E2's line width, but smaller than E1's, then the peaks might overlap with E1.

Wait, so the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two line widths. Because if the energy difference is bigger than the larger line width, then it's definitely bigger than the smaller one.

So in this case, the larger line width is 6.5e-7 eV (E1's). So the energy difference must be greater than 6.5e-7 eV to resolve them.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 6.5e-7 eV. The others are smaller.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy for each state is inversely proportional to its lifetime, given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For the two states:

- For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), the energy uncertainty is:
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the energy uncertainty is:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be significantly larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Since \( \Delta E_1 \) is larger (\( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \)), the energy difference must be greater than this value.

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so the states cannot be resolved.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than Option A and also insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( \Delta E_1 \) (\( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \)) and satisfies the condition for clear resolution.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so the states cannot be resolved.

The only option that ensures the energy difference is sufficiently large to distinguish the two states is **Option C**.

Answer: C
