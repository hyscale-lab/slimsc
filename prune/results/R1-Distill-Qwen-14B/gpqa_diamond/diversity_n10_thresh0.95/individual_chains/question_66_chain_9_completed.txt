Okay, so I've got a question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1. Lorentz Symmetry, 2. Poincaré symmetry, 3. CP symmetry, and 4. CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct combination.

Wait, wait. So SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension. But I remember that SMEFT is built respecting certain symmetries, but not others, right?

First, what's Lorentz symmetry? Well, that's the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. The SM respects this, so SMEFT should too, because it's an effective theory that's supposed to include the SM. So operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant. So option 1 (Lorentz Symmetry) is definitely a must.

Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, meaning momentum conservation and energy-momentum relation. The SM respects Poincaré symmetry, so SMEFT should as well. Therefore, option 2 (Poincaré) should also be a symmetry that operators respect. So both 1 and 2 are correct so far.

Now, what about CP symmetry (option 3)? CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in all cases. For example, CP violation is observed in certain processes like kaon and B meson systems. So SMEFT can have operators that break CP symmetry. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP. If an operator violates CP, it's allowed. So option 3 isn't a must.

Then there's CPT symmetry (option 4). CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, the CPT theorem states that a Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT-symmetric. So any theory that respects Lorentz symmetry must also respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry (as we concluded for option 1), it must also respect CPT. So option 4 is a must.

Wait, but does SMEFT explicitly include CPT? Or is it a consequence of Lorentz symmetry? Because if operators are Lorentz-invariant, then CPT symmetry is automatically enforced. So yes, operators must respect CPT.

So the required symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincaré), and 4 (CPT). Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4, which is choice C. Option D has 1,3,4. But since 3 isn't required, D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait another thing: Poincaré symmetry. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but do the SMEFT operators themselves have to respect Poincaré symmetry? Because Poincaré includes translations, which relate to momentum conservation. The effective theory is constructed in a way that includes all possible operators consistent with the SM symmetries, which include Poincaré. So yes, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.

So the correct answer should include 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options:

A) 1,2 → includes 1 and 2, but not 4. So incorrect.

B) 3,4 → incorrect, as 3 is not required.

C) 1,2,4 → this is correct.

D) 1,3,4 → incorrect, as 3 is not required.

So the answer is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) and higher-dimensional operators, while respecting certain symmetries. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry, which applies to spacetime transformations like rotations and boosts, is fundamental to both the SM and SMEFT. Since SMEFT is built to include the SM, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations, ensuring momentum conservation and the energy-momentum relation. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT must also respect it, as it is part of the framework of effective field theories.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation and parity. While the SM respects CP symmetry in some cases, CP violation is observed in certain processes (e.g., kaon and B meson systems). SMEFT does not require operators to respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is allowed in the theory.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge, parity, and time reversal. The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required. Among the given options, the correct combination is **1, 2, 4**.
