Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what's going on. 

The question is about a wave function of a particle. Each particle is in a system, and they all have the same conditions. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. They mention that when they measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region, right? Because if a particle is measured and not found, the probability of it being there must be zero.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The wave function being zero would mean the particle isn't present there, but the given wave function isn't written that way. Let me think again. Oh, no, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually complex, but the probability density is the square of the absolute value. So, the probability density is |ψ|^2.

But the problem states that when they measured, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be non-zero only in that interval. So, outside x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero. So, the wave function as given must be zero for x < 1 and x >3.

Looking at the given wave function: (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. If this equals zero for x outside 1-3, then both terms must be zero. Wait, but that's not possible because 0.5i is a constant term. Unless a is zero, but that would make the entire function -0.5i, which is non-zero everywhere. That can't be right because the problem says that particles are found only between 1 and 3; elsewhere, the wave function should be zero.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is given in a part of space where the particle can exist, meaning that it's non-zero between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So perhaps within the region x=1 to x=3, the wave function is non-zero, and outside, it's zero. But the given wave function doesn't look like it's zero outside unless some conditions are met.

Wait, perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3. So we don't have to worry about x outside that interval because it's not part of the region where the particle exists. But then, the way the problem is phrased is a bit confusing. It says "the wave function of each particle in a part of space where it can exist is described as..." So, the part of space where it can exist includes x from 1 to 3, and the wave function is given in that region.

But, wait, the wave function needs to satisfy normalization because it's a valid quantum state. So we can use normalization to find the value of 'a'. 

The normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 dx over all space equals 1. So, since ψ is zero outside x=1 to x=3, the integral is from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|^2. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The absolute square is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because (a + ib)^2 would be a^2 + b^2 when considering the modulus squared.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when you take the modulus squared of a complex number, it's (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So for ψ(x) = A - i B, |ψ|^2 = A² + B². So here, A is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and B is 0.5. So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me split this integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(x+1) dx is ln(x+1). Evaluated from 1 to 3: [ln(4) - ln(2)] = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first part: a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. The integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total equation is:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate that. Let me remember that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.8492.

Wait, the options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

So 0.8492 is approximately 0.85, so option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

The modulus squared is correct: (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)².

So the integral is:

a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + 0.25*(3-1) = 1.

Compute the first integral:

∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931. So a² * 0.6931 + 0.5 = 1.

0.6931 a² = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Square root of that is about 0.849, which is 0.85. So option B.


The problem involves determining the value of "a" in the wave function of a particle, given that the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The wave function is provided as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function must satisfy the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this interval. Thus, the normalization integral reduces to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx \)

For the first integral, the integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2) \approx 0.6931
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2)
\]

For the second integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition is:

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849 \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), corresponding to option **B**.
