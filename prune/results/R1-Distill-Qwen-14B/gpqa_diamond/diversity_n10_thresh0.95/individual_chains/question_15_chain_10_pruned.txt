Alright, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, okay, let me try to think through this. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance.

The question says they're looking at two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1 is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits.

The stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh wait, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius. Interesting.

So, what determines the transit probability? I think the formula for transit probability is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else. Or wait, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on the area of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size.

Transit probability (P) is given by P = (R_p / a) * (something), but wait, perhaps more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2, but I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that the transit probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the star's radius, but scaled by some factors. Or wait, the transit probability (assuming random orientation) is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits. Oh right, the alignment probability is (R_s / a) * something.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The probability that a planet transits its star is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (b_max)), where b_max is the maximum impact parameter.

Wait, no, I think the impact parameter is the distance in units of the star's radius from the center. The maximum impact parameter for a transit is when the planet just grazes the star's limb; beyond that, no transit occurs. So, the transit probability is the area where the planet's path is across the star's disk, divided by the total possible area (which would be a circle of radius a, but that's in astronomical units... Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall the formula. The transit probability for a planet in an orbit with semi-major axis a (in units where R_s is the star's radius) is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (R_s / a). Hmm.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but that can't be right because R_p is much smaller than R_s, and a is much larger than both. Wait, maybe not. Wait, another approach. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is given by (R_s / a) * (something else). Or perhaps it's (R_p / a) * (R_s / a), but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't, but I remember that the probability of a transit is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital inclination is such that it transits. The inclination needs to be less than a certain value for a transit to occur. So the probability of the planet transiting is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) / π. Wait, no, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another way: The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is within a certain range relative to our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the area that would result in a transit to the total possible area.

The planet's orbit is a circle with radius a. The star has radius R_s. For a transit to happen, the planet must pass within a distance R_s (from the star's center) in the plane of the sky. So the area where a transit can occur is a circle of radius (a - R_s), but wait, that might not be right. Because if the planet's orbit is much larger than the star, the area where the planet can be in front is a ring around the star.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relative sizes. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit would result in a transit is approximately (R_s / a) * (R_p / R_s). So P ≈ (R_p / a) * (R_s / R_s) = R_p / a. But that can't be right because R_p is much smaller than a.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The transit probability is given by the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, because the planet's orbit is much larger. So the area where the planet can transit is a circle of radius R_s (the star's radius) centered at the star, and the planet's orbit is a much larger circle of radius a. So the probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the orbit's disk, which would be (π R_s^2) / (π a^2) ) = (R_s / a)^2. But wait, that's just the geometric probability based on the area. But the transit also depends on the planet's size, right? Because if the planet is smaller, the dip is smaller, but the probability of it blocking any part of the star is the same as the area ratio.

Wait, no, the transit probability is the likelihood that the planet's path crosses the star's disk. That's determined by the relative sizes of the two circles (the star and the planet's orbit). So the probability is (R_s / a) * (something else). Oh wait, I think the correct formula is (R_p + R_s) / a, but that doesn't make sense when R_p is much smaller than R_s.

Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (something else). Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the factors.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability assuming a random inclination is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key factor is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because if the planet is closer (smaller a), the chance that its orbit's plane will allow a transit is higher. Wait, because when a is smaller, the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on.

Wait, another approach. The probability of transit is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Because the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2, and the likelihood that the orbital inclination is such that it transits is (R_s / a).

Wait, let me think about it. The transit probability depends on two factors: the chance that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough (so that it actually crosses our line of sight), and the size of the planet relative to the star.

So, the first factor is the geometric probability, which is (R_s / a), because if the planet's orbit is much larger than the star, the chance that it passes in front is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital radius. The second factor is (R_p / R_s)^2, because the area of the planet relative to the star determines the depth of the transit, but perhaps the probability of the transit itself is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a).

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. The transit probability (P) is approximately given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (some factor)

Alternatively, I've read somewhere that the probability of a transit is (R_p + R_s) / a, but that can't be right because if a is much larger, the probability approaches zero.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula. I remember that for a planet with semi-major axis a and orbital inclination i relative to us, a transit occurs when i is less than 90 degrees, and the exact probability depends on the star's size and the planet's orbit.

The formula for the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p + R_s) / a * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) )

Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, another formula I've heard of is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (something like 1 / (a) )

No, maybe it's better to think of it as the ratio of the star's angular size to the planet's orbital angular size as seen from Earth. Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), which would be (R_p^2 R_s) / (R_s^2 a) ) = R_p^2/(R_s a). But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I've found conflicting thoughts in my memory, so perhaps I should think of it in terms of the ratio of the orbital period and the star's size.

Wait, another approach: The probability of a transit is higher when the planet is closer to the star. Because if a is smaller, the star's disk is a larger fraction of the planet's orbit, so the chance of the planet passing in front is higher.

In this problem, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2. Since the period is shorter, and assuming both are orbiting stars of different masses, perhaps we can compute their semi-major axes using Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that (a^3) / (P^2) = (G (M_s) ) / (4 π² ), where M_s is the mass of the star. So for each planet, a is determined by P and M_s.

So let's compute the semi-major axes of Planet_1 and Planet_2.

Given:

- Planet_1's period P1 = P2 / 3.

Planet_1's star mass M1 = 2 * M2.

Wait, since Kepler's law is a^3 = (G M_s) (P/(2π))².

So a1^3 = (G M1) (P1/(2π))^2.

Similarly, a2^3 = (G M2) (P2/(2π))^2.

Let me compute a1 and a2.

Express a1 in terms of a2.

So, a1^3 = [G * 2 M2] * (P2/(3 * 2π))².

Which is [2 G M2] * (P2^2)/(9 (2 π)^2) )

Similarly, a2^3 = [G M2] * (P2/(2 π))².

So a2^3 = G M2 * P2²/(4 π²).

So, taking the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = [ 2 * (1/9) ) ] / [1/(4) ].

Wait, let me compute that:

a1^3 / a2^3 = [2 * (P2^2)/(9 (2 π)^2) ) * G M2 ] / [ G M2 * (P2^2)/(4 π^2) ) ].

Wait, actually, no, that's not right. Let me compute a1^3 divided by a2^3.

a1^3 = [G * 2 M2] * (P1/(2π))².

But P1 = P2/3, so (P1/(2π))² = (P2/(3*2π))² = P2²/(36 π²).

So a1^3 = 2 G M2 * (P2²)/(36 π²) = (2/36) G M2 P2² / π² = (1/18) G M2 P2² / π².

a2^3 = G M2 * (P2/(2π))² = G M2 * P2²/(4 π²).

So the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 is (1/18) / (1/4) ) = (4)/(18) = 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.222.

Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606, because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 0.6^3 = 0.216, 0.61^3 is about 0.226, 0.606^3 is (0.6^3) + 3*(0.6)^2*(0.006) + ... which would be 0.216 + 0.01296 + ... ≈ 0.228. Hmm, my target is 2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

So 0.605^3: Let me compute 0.605*0.605 = 0.366025. Then 0.366025 * 0.605 ≈ 0.2213. Oh, that's very close to 0.2222. So a1/a2 ≈ 0.605.

So a1 is about 0.605 times a2.

So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

Now, the transit probability depends on (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), but wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the transit probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a multiplied by some factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s / a)^2)) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the key factors are the ratio R_s / a, because a smaller a increases the chance of transit.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it as the transit probability being proportional to (R_p / a)^2, but also influenced by the star's size. Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) ) × something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the transit probability as:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (something like 1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) )

But I'm not confident, so perhaps I should think of it in terms of the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius.

Wait, another approach. Let's assume that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Because the area of the star is π R_s², and the area of the planet's orbit (projected) is π a². The probability that the planet's path crosses the star is the ratio of these areas times some geometric factor.

Wait, but if the planet's orbit is much larger than the star, the probability would be approximately (R_s² / a²) × (R_p² / R_s²) ) = (R_p^2 / a^2) × (R_s^2 / R_s^2) → R_p^2 / a^2. But that doesn't account for the inclination.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Let me try a different angle. Let's compute
