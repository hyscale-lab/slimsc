Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just add them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for energy, I should calculate the total relativistic energy for each astronaut and add them together.

Wait, let me break this down. The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. So first, the relative speed. Oh wait, but relative to whom? If they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference. Or is it? No, wait, in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities. I remember the formula for adding two velocities u and v is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). But wait, in this case, if one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction, the relative speed is not their difference. Wait no, the relative speed would be the speed of one as observed from the other's frame. So I think I need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula where u is the speed of the second astronaut in the first's frame or vice versa.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The formula for the relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²) if u is the velocity of the object in the first frame (like the frame moving at velocity v). Or wait, maybe I have it backwards. Let me think: if frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to frame S, then an object moving at u in S would have a velocity u' in S' given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, what is B's speed in A's frame?

So, in A's frame, the speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² ). Let me compute that. Numerator is -0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1429c. Oh wait, but speed is a scalar, so the magnitude is 0.1429c. So about 0.14c. That would be the relative speed.

Wait, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's a good start.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c². So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c: gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That matches.

Option D: same speed, E=5 mc². That's less than what I calculated.

Another option: option B has E=4.96, which is lower, so no.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1429c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the speed is a scalar, so the magnitude is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass \( m_1 = 2m \)
- Velocity \( v_1 = 0.6c \)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy \( E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass \( m_2 = 3m \)
- Velocity \( v_2 = 0.5c \)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy \( E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options:
- **Option C** matches both the relative speed and total energy.

### Final Answer:
Answer: C
