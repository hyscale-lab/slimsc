Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to identify what each product is.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating this with KOH... Oh, wait, KOH is a strong base. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is quite rigid, but with two bromines in the 1,3 positions. When you treat dibrominated compounds with KOH, especially vicinal dihalides (like 1,2), you get elimination reactions, forming alkenes via an E2 mechanism. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; they're on adjacent carbons but across the structure. Wait, no, in adamantane, each carbon is connected in a diamond lattice. So 1,3 positions are actually on opposite ends of a chair-like structure, perhaps? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation.

Alternatively, another possibility: When two bromines are on adjacent carbons in a structure that can form a double bond upon elimination, the KOH would cause elimination, forming an alkene. But wait, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, are the Br atoms on adjacent carbons or not? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is bonded to three others, arranged in a diamond lattice. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on two carbons that are two apart. Wait, no, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are on opposite faces, perhaps not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination. Wait, when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in a situation where elimination is possible, the product is an alkene. So if KOH is in excess and heat is applied, it's likely an E2 elimination, producing an alkene. But the position of the double bond depends on the structure.

Wait, what's the product of heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Oh, wait, maybe it's more than just elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. But given that KOH is a strong base, elimination seems more likely.

So product 1 is probably an adamantane derivative with a double bond. But let me think. Adamantane has four equivalent bridgehead positions. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgeheads. When KOH is added, perhaps it leads to an elimination reaction, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond between the bridgehead carbons. Wait, but bridgehead alkenes are usually not possible due to Bredt's Rule, which states that alkenes cannot form at bridgehead positions in bicyclic structures unless the ring is large enough. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so it's a polycyclic structure. So perhaps the elimination leads to a different structure.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution, but that would require a good leaving group and perhaps a SN2 mechanism. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's an elimination. Wait, but if it's elimination, then the product would be an alkene, and the IR would show a peak around 1700 cm-1, which matches with a carbonyl. Wait, but in the given IR, product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, if product 1 has a carbonyl group, that suggests that elimination didn't form an alkene but perhaps a ketone. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? Or maybe it's a different kind of elimination, like forming a carbonyl via a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening or rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation, but not forming a double bond but rather a ketone. Wait, but how? Oh, maybe a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that requires a ketone already and introduces an oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, but with two Br atoms, and KOH in excess, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would form a diol. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl, not an alcohol. So maybe not.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's the formation of a diketone. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination, each Br is removed with an adjacent hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But then, that would form an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an epoxide or something else. But I'm not seeing it. Let me think again.

Wait, the IR of product 1 shows 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 likely has a ketone group. So maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and the elimination forms a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, but each elimination forms an alcohol, which then loses a proton to form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's an E2 mechanism where each Br is removed with a base, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that when both Br atoms are eliminated, the resulting structure has a carbonyl group. Let me imagine the structure. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. So 1 and 3 are two bridgehead carbons. Wait, maybe the structure after elimination forms a bridge where the carbons that had Br now have a double bond to oxygen, making a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is adjacent to a CH2 group, and elimination would form a carbonyl. Let me think about a simple example. If we have two vicinal Br atoms, like CH2BrCH2Br, upon elimination with KOH, we would form CH2=CH2 and 2 HBr. But that's an alkene, not a carbonyl. So maybe the starting material isn't vicinal.

Wait, but in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the Br atoms are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, and elimination would bridge them, forming a bicyclic structure with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that might not fit the IR data, which is a single carbonyl peak. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The IR absorption at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 probably has a ketone group. So perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and each Br is on a bridgehead. When KOH is added, the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Since the structure is symmetric, perhaps both Br atoms are removed, leading to two ketone groups. But wait, would that give a diketone? But the IR shows a single peak, not two. So maybe only one carbonyl is formed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination of two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane forms a single ketone. Let me think about the structure. Suppose each bridgehead has a Br and a CH2 group. Elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps in the process, some rearrangement forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, and each elimination forms an oxygen-containing group. So perhaps the product is a diepoxide? No, that doesn't fit the carbonyl peak.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a single ketone, like adamantanone.

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure. If you remove two Br atoms and form a ketone, perhaps the product is adamantan-1-one (or similar). Let me imagine: if one bridgehead carbon has a Br and another bridgehead has a Br as well. Upon elimination, each Br is removed along with a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond. But that would produce an alkene, not a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone via some kind of cyclization. For example, maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, and elimination leads to a conjugated system that becomes a ketone. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. If each Br is replaced by an OH group, we would get a diol. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl peak. So maybe not.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that's not a carbonyl either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The peak at 4.79 ppm is probably a triplet or something else, but for two protons. Considering that, maybe it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or an alcohol. But IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, the peak at 4.79 ppm is a singlet? Or a triplet? The question says 4.79 (2H). So integration is 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, such as an ether or an alcohol. But wait, if it's a ketone, the adjacent protons would be deshielded. Let me think about a typical NMR spectrum for a ketone. The carbonyl is usually not seen in 1H NMR, but the protons adjacent to it would be deshielded and appear downfield.

But in product 1, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is an -OCH2- group. For example, in an epoxide, the protons would be around 3-4 ppm. Wait, but 4.79 is a bit upfield for an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that would have a broad peak, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. A primary alcohol's protons are around 1-1.5 ppm, secondary around 1.5-2.5, and tertiary around 2.5-3.5. But 4.79 is more like an ether or an adjacent oxygen. Wait, but with the IR showing a carbonyl, maybe it's not an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 peak is from a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a ketone like acetone, the CH3 groups are around 2.1 ppm. But in this case, maybe it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Wait, what's the typical shift for a CH2 adjacent to a ketone? I think it's around 2.5 ppm. But the 4.79 is higher, so maybe it's an ether or some other group.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But the IR would show a strong peak around 1700, but maybe two peaks. But the question says a 'characteristic absorbance' which suggests one peak. So perhaps it's a single ketone.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Maybe the first reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl.

Wait, when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can form a ketone. For example, if the dihalide is geminal, like R-CBr2-R', then elimination could form a ketone. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3, which are not geminal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, but in adamantane, which is a rigid structure, perhaps elimination isn't possible, leading to a rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a bridge across the molecule. Let me imagine a structure where elimination of HBr from two adjacent bridgehead carbons forms a bridge, resulting in a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the KOH is causing a cleavage reaction. If the dihalide is treated with a strong base, perhaps it forms a carbonyl via a cleavage mechanism. For instance, in the cleavage of 1,3-dibromoalkanes using a strong base, each Br is replaced by an OH, leading to a diol. But again, that wouldn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a ketone to begin with. So that's probably not it.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure of four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three other bridgeheads. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgeheads that are opposite each other.

When KOH is added, perhaps it abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond. But given Bredt's rule, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed unless the ring is large. So perhaps that's not the case. Therefore, maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl group instead.

Wait, perhaps each elimination leaves behind an oxygen. Wait, but KOH provides OH- ions, so perhaps the elimination forms an epoxide or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But how would two Br atoms substitute to form a carbonyl group?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but then the diol could undergo oxidation to form a ketone. But that would require additional reagents, and KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. So that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe the product is a single bromide with a hydroxyl group, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR data for product 1. The integrals are 2H (4.79), 10H (2.41-2.23), and 2H (1.94). The 10H in the middle suggest perhaps a set of equivalent protons, maybe from a cyclohexane ring. The 2H at 4.79 could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. And the 2H at 1.94 could be another CH2 group somewhere else.

If it's a ketone, then perhaps the structure is something like a bridge with a carbonyl. Let's imagine a structure where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. The 4.79 ppm peak could be a CH2-O group, but where is the carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol, but the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3300 cm^-1, which would be for O-H stretching. The IR is at 1720, which is more of a C=O.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the product is a quinone or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. If we have two ketone groups, the IR would show a strong peak around 1700. But the question says the IR has a characteristic absorbance at 1720, implying a single carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclohexanone derivative. But given the starting material is adamantane, perhaps it's a cyclohexenone or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I should move to the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst, perhaps in Friedel-Crafts reactions or in some elimination reactions.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl group. So when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, maybe it undergoes some kind of enol formation or tautomerism. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but for that, you need an aromatic ring. Adamantane doesn't have an aromatic system, but perhaps if product 1 has a ketone, maybe it's involved in some kind of cycloaddition or other reaction.

Wait, another possibility: If product 1 is a ketone, then treating it with a Lewis acid could lead to the formation of an enol or enolate, but under what conditions? Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen or aldol condensation, but without an appropriate carbonyl partner, I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol, and product 2 is an ether formed through some kind of elimination, but I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, when ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2, which is kept at low temperature, it performs ozonolysis, cleaving the double bond. Then, adding dimethylsulfide (a reductive work-up) would break the ozonides into carbonyl compounds.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Let me try to piece this together.

So, product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. It has a carbonyl group (IR 1720). Then, product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2, which has a double bond (since ozonolysis is done on it). So, product 2 has an alkene.

So, to recap:

1,3-dibromoadamantane â (KOH, heat) â product 1 (with carbonyl) â (Al(OiPr)3, heat) â product 2 (with alkene) â (O3, then DMS) â product 3 (with carbonyl groups from ozonolysis).

So, how does product 1 become product 2? Since product 2 has a double bond, perhaps product 1 undergoes a dehydration reaction, forming an alkene. But product 1 already has a carbonyl group. So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enol with a ketone), which would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but how would product 1, which is a ketone, form product 2 with a double bond? Maybe through an elimination reaction, perhaps using the Lewis acid as a catalyst. Aluminum isopropoxide can act as a Lewis acid, facilitating the removal of a proton to form a double bond.

So, if product 1 is a secondary alcohol adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps it loses a water molecule to form an alkene. But product 1 has a carbonyl, so perhaps product 1 is a tertiary alcohol, but that would lead to a different reaction.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it loses two water molecules, forming a double bond. But product 1's IR has a carbonyl, not an O-H stretch, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). So, product 1 â product 2 via dehydration. How? Maybe the Lewis acid (Al(OiPr)3) helps in the removal of a proton alpha to the carbonyl, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Yes, that makes sense. So, product 1 is a ketone (maybe cyclohexanone derivative), and product 2 is an enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone).

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond. Ozonolysis of an enone would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups on each fragment. But depending on the structure, the ozonolysis products can vary.

Now, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. So, the NMR of product 3 will show protons adjacent to carbonyl groups, which would be deshielded and appear downfield.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those exchanging with solvent). So, in product 3, which is the ozonolysis product, what's the structure?

Assuming product 2 is an enone, such as cyclohexenone. Ozonolysis of cyclohexenone would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, cyclohexenone (cyclohex-2-en-1-one) would upon ozonolysis give two aldehyde groups, maybe, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, no. Ozonolysis of an enone would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, if the enone is a cyclic structure, ozonolysis would open the ring and form two carbonyls.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a bridged enone, like an adamantane derivative with a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is a cyclohexenone. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, so the product would have two ketone groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's an exo-methylene group, leading to a diketone after ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, where each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group.

So, the NMR of product 3 would have protons adjacent to carbonyl groups. These protons would be deshielded and appear downfield, around Î´ 2.1 or so, perhaps. But in the question, the most deshielded hydrogen is being considered.

Wait, but if product 3 has two carbonyl groups, perhaps the adjacent protons are split into certain coupling patterns.

Wait, in ozonolysis, each carbonyl group is adjacent to a CH2 group if the original double bond was between two CH2 groups. Let me imagine the structure: if product 2 was (CH2)2C=CH2, then ozonolysis would break into two (CH2)2CO groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 3 is a diketone with each ketone adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each CH2 is next to a carbonyl. The protons on these CH2 groups would couple with each other and possibly with any neighboring protons.

Wait, for example, if product 3 is something like O=C-R-CH2-CO=O, then each CH2 would be between two carbonyls. The protons on the CH2 would be split by adjacent groups.

But perhaps the structure is more of a bridge. Let me think, product 3 might have two carbonyl groups adjacent to a single CH2 group, which is then connected to other CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Let me model this: imagine a structure where a single CH2 is between two carbonyls, like O=C-CH2-CO. So, the CH2 is next to two carbonyl groups. The protons on that CH2 would be deshielded and would couple with each other and with any neighboring protons.

Wait, but in that scenario, the CH2 would be split into a triplet, perhaps. Because each proton on the CH2 would be adjacent to two equivalent protons on the same CH2. Wait, no, the coupling between the two protons on the same CH2 would be a doublet of doublets or something else. Wait, but in reality, the two protons on a CH2 are equivalent and split each other into a singlet. But wait, in that case, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each proton would be split by the other.

Wait, no, the two protons on the same CH2 are equivalent, so their coupling isn't observed as splitting in the NMR. So, the CH2 would be a singlet if not coupled to any other protons. But if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, then each proton on the first CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, let's model it. Suppose we have O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. The central CH2 is between two CH2 groups. Each proton on the central CH2 would be split by the two protons on each adjacent CH2. Wait, but the central CH2 would be flanked by two CH2 groups: one on the left (O=C-CH2-) and one on the right (-CH2-CO). So, each proton on the central CH2 (let's call it CH2a) would be adjacent to the two protons on the left CH2 (CH2b) and the two protons on the right CH2 (CH2c). 

Wait, no, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, then the middle CH2 (CH2b) is between CH2a and CH2c. In this case, each proton on CH2b would couple with the two protons on CH2a and the two protons on CH2c. But wait, in reality, each CH2 is next to the next CH2. So, CH2a is next to CH2b, and CH2b is next to CH2c. So each CH2 group is adjacent to another.

Wait, perhaps I should consider a specific example. Let's say product 3 is a molecule with a structure like O=C-(CH2)n-CO, where n is the number of CH2 units. For instance, if n=1, it would be O=C-CH2-CO, but that's a very strained structure. Alternatively, n=2 would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, which is more plausible.

In that structure, each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2. So, the CH2 closest to the carbonyl (CH2a) would be next to CH2b. Each proton in CH2a would couple with the two protons in CH2b, leading to a triplet for each. But since all four protons are equivalent in a CH2 group, the coupling would be a triplet for each CH2 group.

But wait, actually, each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2 group. So, for CH2a, each proton is split by the two protons in CH2b, leading to a triplet. Similarly, CH2b would be split by CH2a and CH2c, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, each of the middle CH2 groups would be adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So, the middle CH2 would be split by two adjacent CH2 groups, each contributing two protons. So, each proton on the middle CH2 would see four neighboring protons, leading to a quintet (pentet). Wait, but that's if each adjacent CH2 is equivalent.

Alternatively, if the structure is symmetric, perhaps the middle CH2 is equivalent on both sides, leading to a different splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each of which has two protons. So, each proton on the central CH2 would couple with four protons (two from each adjacent CH2 group). That would lead to a quintet (n+1, where n=4, so 5 peaks, a pentet).

Wait, but in reality, each adjacent CH2 group has two protons. So, for a central CH2 group, each proton is split by two neighboring protons on each side. So, the splitting would be 2+2=4, leading to a pentet. So, the most deshielded hydrogen (on the central CH2) would be a pentet.

But wait, the options are: A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

So, if the most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH2 group that's adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons, then it would be a quintet (option D). But let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group and perhaps another group with one proton. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The initial steps leading to product 3. Let me try to outline the possible structures.

1,3-dibromoadamantane â product 1 (heated with KOH): forms a ketone, perhaps adamantanone.

Then, product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid. This could cause an elimination, forming an enone. So, product 2 is an enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone).

Ozonolysis of the enone would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would be a diketone.

Assuming the enone is in a bridge position, ozonolysis would break the bridge, leading to two separate carbonyl groups connected by some structure.

Wait, perhaps the enone in product 2 is part of a bridge structure. Ozonolysis would break the bridge, leading to a diketone.

In such a case, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups connected by a chain of CH2 groups. For example, something like O=C-(CH2)2-CO.

In this case, the CH2 groups between the two carbonyls would be the most deshielded. Each CH2 would be next to a carbonyl, making their protons deshielded and appear downfield.

So, the central CH2 in O=C-CH2-CH2-CO would have each proton coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, for the CH2 in the middle (CH2b) in O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, each proton on CH2b is adjacent to two protons on CH2a and two on CH2c. So, four neighboring protons, leading to a quintet (n=4, so 5 peaks).

But wait, in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the central CH2 is flanked by two carbonyls. Each CH2 would be adjacent to the next CH2. So, the CH2 groups would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

So, the two CH2 groups are each adjacent to a carbonyl. The coupling between the two CH2 groups would cause each to split into a triplet.

Wait, no. The first CH2 (CH2a) is adjacent to the carbonyl and the next CH2 (CH2b). Each proton in CH2a would couple with the two protons in CH2b, leading to a triplet. Similarly, each proton in CH2b would couple with the two protons in CH2a and the two in CH2c (if any). But in this case, it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, so CH2b is next to CH2a and CH2c (which is another CH2 attached to the carbonyl). Wait, no, in this structure, CH2b is between CH2a and the carbonyl. So, CH2b is adjacent to CH2a and the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, making it a four-membered chain. Then, the central CH2 group (CH2b) is adjacent to CH2a and CH2c. So, each proton in CH2b would see two protons from CH2a and two from CH2c, leading to a quintet.

But the most deshielded hydrogen would be the ones closest to the carbonyl groups. So, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would be more deshielded. Their protons would couple with the adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each CH2 next to a carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2. So, for each CH2a (adjacent to carbonyl), each proton would couple with the two protons in CH2b. So, each CH2a would be a triplet, and CH2b would be a quintet if it's between two CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a single CH2 group between two carbonyl groups, like O=C-CH2-CO. Then, the CH2 group would be split by any adjacent groups. But in this case, the CH2 is between two carbonyls, so no adjacent CH2 groups. So, the CH2 would be a singlet. But that's unlikely because in ozonolysis, the molecule is usually cleaved into two parts, each with a carbonyl.

Wait, but in ozonolysis of a cyclic enone, it would break to form two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is a cyclic enone like cyclohexenone, ozonolysis would break the ring into two aldehyde groups. But I'm not exactly certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with the structure O=C-(CH2)m-CO, where m is the number of CH2 groups between the two carbonyls.

If m=1, it's O=C-CH2-CO, which is a three-membered structure, which is not possible due to ring strain. So m=2 would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, which is a four-membered structure, possible but strained. m=3 would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, a five-membered structure, which is more plausible.

In this case, the central CH2 groups (if any) would have coupling with neighboring CH2 groups.

But the most deshielded hydrogen would be the ones next to the carbonyl groups. So, the CH2 groups at the ends (adjacent to the carbonyls) would have their protons coupled to the next CH2 group.

So, for example, in O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, the end CH2 groups (CH2a and CH2d) would each be adjacent to a CH2 group (CH2b and CH2c, respectively). Each proton in CH2a would see two protons in CH2b, leading to a triplet. Similarly, the CH2d protons would each be triplets. The middle CH2 group (CH2b and CH2c) would be adjacent to two CH2 groups, leading to a quintet for their protons.

Wait, but in a five-membered structure, the two CH2 groups in the middle would each be adjacent to two other CH2 groups, leading their protons to be split into a quintet. The end CH2 groups would each be adjacent to one CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But the question asks about the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be the ones adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Those would be the CH2 groups at the ends (CH2a and CH2d), which would each be triplets. So, their coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Wait, but product 3 is the ozonolysis product. If the original enone was in a bridge structure, the ozonolysis would break the bridge, leading to a diketone. So, perhaps the structure is more like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, which is a four-membered ring, but as I said, that's strained. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more linear.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to a single CH2 group. For example, in a structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the CH2 groups at the ends are each adjacent to one CH2 group, leading to a triplet for each. The middle CH2 would be adjacent to two CH2 groups, leading to a quintet.

In that case, the most deshielded hydrogen would be the end CH2 groups, each being a triplet. Alternatively, the middle CH2 would have a quintet, but it's less deshielded than the ends.

Wait, but deshielding depends on proximity to electronegative groups. The end CH2 groups are adjacent to carbonyls, which are more deshielding than the middle CH2, which is between two CH2 groups. So, the end CH2 groups' hydrogens would be more deshielded.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl group, and this CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So, each H in this CH2 would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Therefore, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought it might be a quintet. So, which is it? Let me clarify.

If the end CH2 group (adjacent to a carbonyl) is next to a single CH2 group, then each H in this end CH2 would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So, the most deshielded H (on the end CH2) would be a triplet.

But the question says 'the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)'. So, the end CH2 groups next to the carbonyls are the most deshielded. Their coupling is with the adjacent CH2 group, so triplet.

Therefore, the correct answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a dehydrohalogenation reaction. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, indicating the formation of a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm for 2H, 2.41â2.23 ppm for 10H, and 1.94 ppm for 2H) supports this conclusion, as the chemical shifts align with a ketone structure.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)â**: Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely facilitates an elimination reaction, forming an Î±,Î²-unsaturated ketone (enone) as product 2. The double bond in the enone is positioned for subsequent ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis and Work-Up**: Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which is a diketone. The structure of product 3 likely has two carbonyl groups separated by a chain of CHâ groups.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CHâ group that is also adjacent to another CHâ group. Each proton in this CHâ group couples with the two protons of the adjacent CHâ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
