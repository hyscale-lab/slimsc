Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography here. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, right, interplanar distance usually refers to the d-spacing between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice.

First, I remember that for a cubic crystal, calculating the interplanar distance is straightforward using the formula d = a / √(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter and (hkl) are the Miller indices. But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal, which isn't cubic. So the formula must be different.

Rhombohedral systems have all edges equal, but the angles between the axes aren't 90 degrees. In this case, all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Oh right, rhombohedral is a special case where the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

I think the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is given by d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2(hk + hl + kl)cosθ) ), where θ is the angle between the axes. Wait, or is it related to the dot product somehow? Maybe I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I have to rely on what I remember.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice vectors a, b, c (not necessarily orthogonal) is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the structure factors. Oh, I think the formula involves the metric tensor. The d-spacing can be found using the relation:

(1/d²) = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα)/(a²)

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the general formula. The general formula when the lattice is not cubic is:

d² = (a² b² c²) / [ (h l m · ... ) ]

Wait, perhaps using the formula that involves the unit cell parameters. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with a basis is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/(a²) + k²/(b²) + l²/(c²)) + (2hk cosγ)/(a b) + (2hl cosβ)/(a c) + (2kl cosα)/(b c) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. I think the correct formula involves the reciprocal of a squared, multiplied by the terms, but for the case of a rhombohedral crystal, since a = b = c, and all angles are the same, the formula simplifies.

So let's try to plug in the variables. The lattice parameter 'a' is given as 10 Angstrom, but wait, no, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a because each atom is situated at the corners of the rhombohedron and the edges are the distance between atoms. So, a = 10 Angstroms.

The Miller indices here are (1,1,1). So h=1, k=1, l=1.

The formula I'm thinking of is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but wait, since the angles are all 30 degrees here. So θ is 30 degrees.

Let me make sure: for a rhombohedral lattice with a = b = c, and angles α = β = γ = θ, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, is that correct? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think so. Let me test this with a cubic case. If θ is 90 degrees, then cosθ is 0. So the formula reduces to a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), which matches the cubic case. That makes sense. So yes, this formula should be correct.

So plugging in the numbers: h=k=l=1, θ=30 degrees, a=10.

First, compute the denominator.

h² +k² + l² = 1+1+1=3.

Then, 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ.

Each term hk, hl, kl is 1*1, so each is 1. So sum is 3. Multiply by 2: 6.

Multiply by cos(30 degrees): cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So the denominator inside the square root is 3 + 5.196 ≈ 8.196.

So d = 10 / sqrt(8.196).

Compute sqrt(8.196). Let's see, 8.196 is approximately 8.196. The square of 2.86 is about 8.18 (since 2.86^2 = 8.1796), so sqrt(8.196) is roughly 2.863.

So 10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 A.

Wait, that's about 3.49, but the options are all around 8-10. I must have made a mistake here.

Wait a minute, wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance 'a' is the edge length, so yes, a=10 A.

But according to this calculation, the (111) plane's d-spacing is about 3.49 A, which isn't any of the options. The options are all around 9 A. So I've done something wrong. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I swapped the formula. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the (222) plane or another. No, the question is about (111).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the general formula for d-spacing in terms of the reciprocal lattice. The general formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/a² + (2 hk cosγ)/(a²) + (2 hl cosβ)/(a²) + (2 kl cosα)/(a²) )

Wait, no, maybe it's better to write the metric tensor approach. The metric tensor g for a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

g = [ 1        cosθ      cosθ
      cosθ     1         cosθ
      cosθ     cosθ      1    ]

Then, the reciprocal of the metric tensor, which is used in calculating d-spacing, is involved. Alternatively, the formula for (d_{hkl})^(-2) is [ h² +k² + l² + 2(hk cosθ) + 2(hl cosθ) + 2(kl cosθ) ] / a².

Wait, perhaps my initial formula was correct, but perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate:

h = 1, k=1, l=1.

So denominator inside sqrt: 1 + 1 +1 + 2*(1*1 * cosθ + 1*1 * cosθ + 1*1 * cosθ )

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, in the initial formula I used, the denominator was h² +k² + l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ.

But in this case, for rhombohedral, all angles are 30 degrees, so cosθ = cos30 ≈ 0.8660.

So h² +k² + l² =3.

2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ = 2*(3)*0.8660 = 6 *0.8660 = 5.196.

So sum is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= ~2.863.

So d=10/2.863 ≈3.493 A.

But the options given are all around 8-10 A, which is much bigger.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question says 'interatomic distance' of 10 Angstrom. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance (edge length) is a, which is 10 A here. So that part is correct.

But the d-spacing for (111) is around 3.5 A, which is not among the options. So either I have the wrong formula, or perhaps the question is about the (222) plane instead.

Let me check what if the plane is (222):

h=2, k=2, l=2.

h² +k² + l² = 12.

2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ = 2*( (4 +4 +4 ) ) * cos30 = 2*12 *0.8660=24 *0.8660=20.784.

Sum: 12 +20.784=32.784.

sqrt(32.784)=5.726.

So d=10 /5.726 ≈1.746 A. Still not matching.

Hmm, maybe I have the formula wrong. Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, that's what I did, but perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the formula has (h² +k² +l²) * (some function of angles).

Wait, another approach: the general formula for the d-spacing in any crystal system is given by:

1/d² = (h² (b² sin²γ)/(a² sin²α) ) + (k² (a² sin²γ)/(b² sin²β) ) + ... Hmm, I'm not sure. This might get complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell and vectors. The plane (111) is defined by the intercepts, but the interplanar distance d is calculated as the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h a* + k b* + l c*,

where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal vectors.

The reciprocal vectors can be found using:

a* = (1/a²) (b x c) · (a direction),

but this might be getting too involved.

Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system with a=b=c and angles α=β=γ=θ, the reciprocal vectors have the same magnitude. The formula for the reciprocal lattice (hkl) is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) * (1/a)

Wait, no, that would make d = a / sqrt(...). As before.

Wait, but if I'm getting a d-spacing of ~3.5 A, which isn't an option, maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the distance between adjacent planes, but in a different definition. Wait, maybe it's not the (111) plane, but another plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is for a hexagonal crystal, not rhombohedral. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should refer back to the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me think again.

In a rhombohedral system, where a = b = c, and all angles are equal, the formula for the interplanar spacing for (hkl) is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Where θ is the angle between the axes. So in this case, θ is 30 degrees.

So plugging in the numbers again:

h = k = l =1.

So, denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*(1+1+1)*cos30 = 3 + 6*(√3/2) = 3 + 3√3 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=~2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.493 A.

Which doesn't match any of the options. So maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal axes, not the direct lattice. Oh wait, that's possible. Because in crystallography, sometimes the formula uses the reciprocal angles.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) ) )

Wait, that's the same as the formula I used before.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the angles in the formula are the angles of the reciprocal lattice, which would be 180-30=150 degrees. But that would make cosθ negative.

Let me try that. So cosθ = cos(150) which is -√3/2 ≈-0.8660.

Then, 2(hk + hl + kl) * (-0.8660) = 2*(3)*(-0.8660) = -5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + (-5.196) = -2.196. That's negative, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm. So perhaps my initial approach is correct, but the answer isn't matching the options. Maybe the question is wrong or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I got the plane indices wrong. The question says (111) plane. Maybe it's a typo and it's (100), but then the options are around 8-10.

Wait, (100) plane: h=1, k=0, l=0.

Denominator: 1 +0 +0 + 2(0 +0 +0) * cosθ =1.

So d=10/1=10 A. Which is option D.

But the question is about (111), so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum of the squares without the cross terms.

Wait, suppose the formula is d= a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), which is the cubic case.

So for (111), d=10 / sqrt(3)= ~5.773 A. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the formula is different. Let me think.

Another formula I came across is: 1/d² = (h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ) ) / a².

Which is what I used earlier. So same result.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are in a different form. Wait, 30 degrees is quite a small angle, leading to a larger d-spacing. Wait, but in the rhombohedral case, smaller angles would lead to larger distances.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 + cosθ) )

Wait, no, I'm just making this up now. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Since in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, this becomes:

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 + 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30) )

Which is:

3 + 2*(3*(√3/2)) =3 + 3√3 ≈3+5.196=8.196.

Same as before. So same result.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. What if the formula uses cos(theta/2) or something? Let me see. If I use cos(15
