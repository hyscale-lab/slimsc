Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to a stationary observer. Hmm, I remember something about how the speed of light doesn't change in different inertial frames, but wait, this is about a medium moving through the lab frame. So maybe I need to use relativistic mechanics here.

Alright, the setup: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I think I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in the glass, it's moving at velocity v, but the light's speed in the glass is c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. But wait, no, that can't be right because the glass is moving. So maybe I'm missing something about relative motion.

Oh wait, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed? Hmm, maybe not. Because according to Einstein's postulate, regardless of the motion of the source or the medium, the speed of light remains c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is a medium moving in the same direction as the light. Oh, wait, but the light is already in the medium. So the medium's motion might affect how the light propagates relative to the lab frame.

Wait, maybe I should think about the frame transformations. Like, if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at speed u in the glass. So what is u, the speed of light in the glass, in the lab frame?

Wait, no, the speed of light in the glass is c/n. Let me think: When the glass is stationary, the light's speed is c/n. But if the glass is moving, does that add to the light's velocity in the lab frame?

Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. So from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, we need to transform this velocity. I think that's the approach. So using the velocity addition formula from relativity.

Wait, but wait. The velocity addition formula is for when you have velocities in different frames. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n. We want to find u, the speed of light in the lab frame.

But wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n. So using the Lorentz transformation, the lab frame would see the light's velocity as u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ). But wait, u' is the velocity in the glass's frame, which is c/n. So substituting that in:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)) ).

So the numerator is (c + n v ) / n, denominator is (1 + (v/(n c))).

Wait, but c is 1, according to the problem statement. So substituting c=1, let's see:

u = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (v/(n * 1)) ) ]

Which is [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ) ]

Because denominator: 1 + v/(n) = (n + v)/n.

So when we divide the numerator by the denominator, the n in the numerator and denominator cancels out.

So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v)

Wait, but that's the expression. But the options are given. Let me check the options.

Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that's what I got.

But wait, another thought: the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the beam. So the direction is such that v is in the same direction as the light. Hmm, but in the velocity addition, the sign should be considered.

Wait, let me think again. If the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light is moving towards the observer in the same direction with speed u in the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n towards the observer. Then, adding the glass's velocity, which is towards the observer, so v is positive.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So in the glass's frame, the lab is moving at velocity -v. So in the glass's frame, the light's velocity is u' = c/n towards the observer. Then, from the lab's frame, the light's speed is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² )

But wait, let me recheck. Let me define the positive direction as the direction towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light inside the glass is moving at u' = c/n towards the observer in the glass's frame. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (u' + v) / [1 + (u' v)/c² ]

Wait, but that's the same as before. So substituting, u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (v/(n)) ), because c=1.

So the denominator is 1 + v/(n) = (n + v)/n. So the numerator is (1 + n v ) / n.

So u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A. So the speed would be (1 + n v)/(n + v)

Wait, but wait a second. Because in the lab frame, the speed of light can't exceed c=1. Let's see under what conditions this expression is less than 1.

So (1 + n v)/(n + v) < 1?

Multiply denominator both sides (assuming positive denominator since v and n are positive, and n>1 for glass), so 1 + n v < n +v.

Which simplifies to 1 < n + v - n v.

Hmm, but not sure if that's necessarily the case. Let's take n=1.5, v=0.5. Then, (1 + 1.5*0.5)/(1.5 +0.5) = (1 + 0.75)/(2) = 1.75/2=0.875 <1. That's okay.

Another case: if v approaches 1 (assuming c=1). Let's say v=0.8, n=1.5.

(1 +1.5*0.8)/(1.5+0.8) = (1+1.2)/(2.3) = 2.2/2.3≈0.956 <1. Still under.

Wait, but when v approaches (n) / (n-1), perhaps? Let me see what happens. Suppose n=2, and v approaches 1. So (1 +2*1)/(2+1)= (3)/(3)=1. So exactly 1. So beyond that, it's impossible. So for v < (n)/(n-1), which for n>1, is a velocity less than 1. So the expression is valid and under 1.

But since the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity v, I think it's assuming that v is within the limits where this holds.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the laboratory, and the light beam is propagating through the glass with an index of refraction \( n \). In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem). 

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light \( u \) in the laboratory frame is given by:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u' = c/n = 1/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory. Substituting \( u' = 1/n \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
\]

Thus, the expression for \( u \) becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is therefore:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This result ensures that the speed of light remains consistent with relativistic principles and does not exceed \( c = 1 \), as required.
