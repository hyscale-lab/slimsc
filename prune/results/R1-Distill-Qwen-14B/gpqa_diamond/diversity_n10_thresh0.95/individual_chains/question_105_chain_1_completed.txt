Okay, so I need to figure out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar is about 1 solar radius, which is roughly 700,000 km. The hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. Oh wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered, so the total area covered by spots is 0.2.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I assume, because they're dark. The temperature difference is 1000 K, so the spots are at 5000 K. Right, because the star is 6000, and the spots are 1000K cooler.

When the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing the observed brightness to dip. Photometric observations would show this as a periodic dip in brightness. But if the spots weren't there, the same dip would be caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

So the question is asking, what exoplanet radius (Rpl) would cause a dip as significant as the spots' effect, as seen from Earth.

I think the approach is to calculate the dip in brightness due to the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

First, let's calculate the dip caused by the spots.

The star's total flux without spots would have a certain value, and when the spots are visible, the flux drops because the spots are cooler.

The flux from a star is proportional to the area times the temperature to the fourth power. So for the entire star, the flux is F_total = sigma * T^4 * (4π R^2). Wait, but when spots are present, part of the surface is at a lower temperature.

The total flux when spots are present is the sum of the flux from the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The unspotted area is the hemisphere minus the spots. The hemisphere area is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that, which is 0.2 * 2π R².

So unspotted area A_unspot = 2π R² (1 - 0.2) = 2π R² * 0.8 = 1.6 π R².

Spot area A_spot = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the flux when spots are visible (F_spotted) is:

F_spotted = (A_unspot * sigma T_star^4) + (A_spot * sigma T_spot^4)

Which simplifies to:

F_spotted = sigma T^4 (A_unspot + A_spot * (T_spot / T_star)^4 )

Wait, but I think it's better to compute the ratio of F_spotted to F_total, where F_total is the flux without any spots. Wait no, when the star is not spotted, it's emitting at T everywhere. But in our case, the spots are present, so the total flux is a mix.

Wait no, the star has spots, so when the spots are facing us, the flux drops. So the dip in brightness is (F_total - F_spotted) / F_total.

Wait wait, maybe I should compute the dip as the difference between the flux when the spots are visible and the flux when they're not, divided by the flux when they're not (which is the star's normal flux).

Wait, but since the star's other side may not be emitting, but in reality, the star emits from both hemispheres. Wait no, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in view. When it's the other hemisphere, all the spots are on the far side, so we see the unspotted area.

Wait, no, wait. The star is a sphere, so when we look at it, the area we see is a hemisphere. If the star has a hemisphere covered with spots, then when that hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. When it's rotated 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us.

So the maximum dip occurs when the spotty hemisphere is in view.

So, the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (because the spots are on the far side). The minimum brightness is when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

Wait, no. Wait, the spots are cooler, so when the spotty side is in view, the flux is lower. So when the star is at a certain rotation phase, the spots are visible, so the flux is lower. When the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is higher.

But for the photometric variations, the dip (minimum) occurs when the spots are visible, and the maximum (when the unspotty side is visible).

Wait, but in reality, the other hemisphere is also emitting. Because the star is a sphere, both hemispheres are emitting, regardless of where the spots are.

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The star is a sphere, and when we observe it, we see the hemisphere that's facing us. If one hemisphere is all spots (but with a 20% filling factor), then when that hemisphere is the one facing us, we see the spots. Otherwise, the other hemisphere, which is unspotted, is facing us.

Wait, no. No, the star's surface has spots on one hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us (e.g., the front), we see all the spots. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum is when the spotty one is visible.

Wait, no, because the filling factor is 20%, so even when the spotty hemisphere is visible, only 20% of its area is spots. So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is in view is a mix of the spots and unspotted regions on that hemisphere.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The problem states that one hemisphere is covered in spots. The filling factor is 20%: so on that hemisphere, 20% of the surface is spots. So the total area of spots on the star is 0.2*(2π R²) because a hemisphere is 2π R² in area.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the hemisphere's facing us. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots (20% area) on that hemisphere. So the flux in that case is F_spotted.

When the other hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are on the back, so we see no spots. So the flux is maximum (F_total), and when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted.

So the dip in brightness is (F_total - F_spotted) / F_total.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma T^4 * 4π R². Because the star emits from the entire surface.

But when the star has spots, the total flux is F = (unspotted area * T^4) + (spotted area * T_spot^4) multiplied by sigma.

Wait, but the star only has one hemisphere with spots. So the area of the star with spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Because the spotty hemisphere has area 2π R², and 20% is covered by spots.

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotted = (sigma) [ (2π R² - 0.2 * 2π R²) * T_star^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * T_spot^4 ].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, that hemisphere is 2π R². Of that, 20% (0.2 * 2π R²) is spots. So the flux from the visible hemisphere is:

F_visible = ( (2π R² - 0.2*2π R²) * T_star^4 ) + ( 0.2*2π R² * T_spot^4 )

Which simplifies to:

F_visible = 2π R² (0.8 T_star^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4 )

But wait, the star's other hemisphere is facing away, so that part isn't contributing to the flux. Because the star's total surface is 4π R². So when we see a hemisphere, the flux is only from that hemisphere.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The star's entire surface emits, but when we observe it, we see only the hemisphere facing us. So the total flux from the star is the sum of all the flux from all parts of the surface. But when a spot is on the far side, it doesn't contribute to the observed flux. So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the unspotted parts of the visible hemisphere and the spotted parts.

Wait, no, the star's entire surface emits, but we can only see the hemisphere that's facing us. So the flux we receive is the sum of the flux from the visible hemisphere.

So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_visible = area_unspotted * sigma T^4 + area_spotted * sigma (T_spot)^4.

Where area_unspotted = (1 - filling factor) * area of the visible hemisphere, which is (0.8) * (2 π R²) = 1.6 π R².

Area_spotted = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So F_visible = sigma [1.6 π R² T^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ]

= sigma π R² (1.6 T^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 )

The total flux when the other hemisphere is visible (unspotted) is:

F_unspotted_visible = 2 π R² T^4 * sigma.

Because the entire visible hemisphere is at T.

So the maximum flux is F_unspotted_visible = 2 π R² sigma T^4.

Wait, no. Wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is from the entire hemisphere without any spots. So it's 2 π R² sigma T^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is sigma π R² (1.6 T^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 )

So the change in flux is F_max - F_spotted_visible?

Wait, no, the star's total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_visible, and when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F_visible is higher.

Wait, but the star's other hemisphere is also emitting. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the other hemisphere is the unspotted one. Wait, no, the star's total surface is 4 π R². If the spotty hemisphere is 2 π R², and the unspotted is the other 2 π R².

Wait, no, the star's entire surface is 4 π R². If one hemisphere (2 π R²) is covered 20% in spots, and the other hemisphere is unspotted, then when we look at the spotty hemisphere, the flux is from 20% spots and 80% unspotted areas. When we look at the other hemisphere, all unspotted.

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotty_visible = (0.8 * 2 π R²) * sigma T^4 + (0.2 * 2 π R²) * sigma (T - 1000)^4 ?

Wait, no, the spot temperature is 5000 K, since the star is 6000 K and spots are 1000 K cooler.

So T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

So F_spotty_visible = 2 π R² (0.8 * T^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4 ) sigma.

F_unspotty_visible = 2 π R² T^4 sigma.

So the dip in brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible is (F_unspotty - F_spotty) / F_unspotty.

Because F_unspotty is the maximum flux (when the unspotted hemisphere is visible), and F_spotty is the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

So the dip amplitude is (F_unspotty - F_spotty) / F_unspotty.

Let me compute that.

F_unspotty = 2 π R² sigma T^4.

F_spotty = 2 π R² sigma (0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T_spot)^4 )

So F_unspotty - F_spotty = 2 π R² sigma [ T^4 - (0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (Ts)^4 ) ]

= 2 π R² sigma [ 0.2 T^4 - 0.2 (Ts)^4 ]

= 2 π R² sigma * 0.2 (T^4 - Ts^4 )

So dip amplitude is [ (0.2 (T^4 - Ts^4 )) / (T^4) ] * (2 π R² sigma ) / (2 π R² sigma )

Wait, no, the denominator is F_unspotty = 2 π R² sigma T^4.

So dip = [ (0.2 (T^4 - Ts^4 )) * 2 π R² sigma ] / (2 π R² sigma T^4 )

The 2 π R² sigma cancels out.

So dip = 0.2 (T^4 - Ts^4 ) / T^4.

Simplify:

dip = 0.2 * [1 - (Ts/T)^4 ]

Ts is 5000 K, T is 6000 K.

So Ts/T = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(Ts/T)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Compute 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. Cubed, 5^3=125, 6^3=216, 125/216≈0.5787. Wait, but it's to the fourth power.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035.

So dip amplitude is approximately 10.35% of the star's maximum brightness.

Wait, that's the dip caused by the spots.

Now, the question is, what is the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same dip when it transits in front of the star.

When a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip is (Area_planet / Area_star ) * (T_planet^4 / T_star^4 )? No, wait, no. The planet itself doesn't emit, it just blocks the star's light.

Wait, the dip in brightness is simply the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star.

Because when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. The dip is (R_planet / R_star )^2, because area scales with radius squared.

Wait, but the star's flux is proportional to its area and temperature. So the brightness without the planet is F = sigma T^4 * 4 pi R^2.

Wait, no, when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's disk. So the observed flux is F = F_star * (1 - (R_planet / R_star )^2 )

Assuming the planet is much smaller than the star, so the blocked area is (pi R_p^2 ) / (pi R_star^2 ) = (R_p / R_star )^2.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the area blocked is (R_p / R_star )^2, so the dip is (R_p / R_star )^2.

But wait, the dip when the spots are present is 0.1035 (10.35% of the star's flux), and the dip when a planet transits is (R_p / R_star )^2.

Wait, wait no. Let me think again.

The dip caused by the planet is (Area_planet / Area_star_visible ) * F_unspotted, but perhaps I'm complicating.

No, when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. The star's entire surface is at T, and the planet blocks a circular area of radius R_p. So the dip is (R_p^2) / (R_star^2) because the area is proportional to R^2.

So dip_planet = (R_p / R_star )^2.

We have dip_spot = 0.1035, and dip_planet = (R_p / R_star )^2.

Set them equal: (R_p / R_star )^2 = 0.1035.

So R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.39, D is ~0.32.

Wait, that would make the answer approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But wait, did I make a mistake in computing the dip for the spots?

Wait, earlier calculation: dip was 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2*(1 - 0.482253) = 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.1035.

So dip is ~10.35%. Which is approximately 0.1035.

But the planet's dip is (R_p / R_star )^2. So to get the same dip, (R_p / R_star )^2 = 0.1035.

So R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Compute (5/6)^4:

5/6 is 0.833333.

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944.

(25/36)^2 = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 minus that is 0.517747.

0.2 * 0.517747 = 0.103549.

So dip is ~10.35%.

So planet radius R_p needed is sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217 R_star.

So the answer is option D, 0.32.


To determine the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots, we analyze the dip in brightness caused by the spots and equate it to the dip caused by the planet.

### Key Parameters:
- **Star's effective temperature**: \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Spot temperature**: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) (1000 K cooler than the star)
- **Filling factor of spots**: \( 0.2 \) (20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots)
- **Star's radius**: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (equal to the Sun's radius)

### Brightness Dip Due to Spots:
The flux from the star is proportional to the area and the fourth power of the temperature. When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The total flux from the star is:

\[
F_{\text{total}} = \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4 \cdot 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2
\]

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

\[
F_{\text{spotted}} = \sigma \left[ (1 - 0.2) \cdot T_{\text{star}}^4 + 0.2 \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right] \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2
\]

The dip in brightness is the difference between the maximum flux (unspotted hemisphere) and the minimum flux (spotty hemisphere), normalized by the maximum flux:

\[
\text{Dip}_{\text{spot}} = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}
\]

Substituting the flux expressions:

\[
\text{Dip}_{\text{spot}} = 1 - \frac{(0.8 T_{\text{star}}^4 + 0.2 T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{T_{\text{star}}^4}
\]

\[
\text{Dip}_{\text{spot}} = 1 - \left( 0.8 + 0.2 \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 \right)
\]

\[
\text{Dip}_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 \right)
\]

Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333
\]

\[
\left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.4823
\]

\[
\text{Dip}_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.4823 \right) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5177 \approx 0.1035
\]

Thus, the dip in brightness caused by the spots is approximately \( 10.35\% \).

### Brightness Dip Due to a Planet:
When an exoplanet transits the star, it blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The dip in brightness is:

\[
\text{Dip}_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

To produce the same dip as the spots (\( \text{Dip}_{\text{spot}} = 0.1035 \)):

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
\]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
