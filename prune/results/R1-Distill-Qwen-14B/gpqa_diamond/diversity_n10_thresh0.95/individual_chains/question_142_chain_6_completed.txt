Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. The question gives a density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states.

The given density matrix is rho = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, let me write that out to visualize it. So, each term is a projector. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is a matrix with 1 in the bottom right. So when I add them together, each adds 1 in their respective corners. Since it's multiplied by 1/2, each of those 1s becomes 1/2.

So putting that into matrix form, rho would be a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are 1/2 and the off-diagonal elements are zero. So it's [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Now, I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, a qubit state is represented as a point on a sphere. But wait, this is a density matrix, not a pure state. So it's a mixed state. The Bloch vector representation for mixed states is different. Oh right, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector.

Density matrices for qubits can be written as rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So, I need to find r such that rho equals that expression.

Let me compute it. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, the expression is (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2.

Expanding this, the (1,1) element would be [1 + r_z]/2, because σz contributes 1* r_z in that position. The (2,2) element would be [1 - r_z]/2. The off-diagonal (1,2) and (2,1) elements come from σx and σy. σx adds r_x/2 in the (1,2) and (2,1) positions. σy contributes (i r_y)/2 and (-i r_y)/2 in those positions.

But wait, looking back at the given rho, its diagonal elements are 1/2 each, and the off-diagonal elements are zero. So let's match the elements.

The (1,1) element of rho is 1/2. From the expression (I + r·σ)/2, it's (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2. So solving this, 1 + r_z = 1 => r_z = 0. Similarly, the (2,2) element is (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2. Plugging r_z = 0, that gives (1 -0)/2=1/2, which matches.

Now the off-diagonal elements. In rho, the (1,2) element is 0. So looking at the expression, the (1,2) element comes from (r_x + i r_y)/2. Because, when you add σx and σy, their (1,2) terms are r_x/2 and (i r_y)/2. So their sum is (r_x + i r_y)/2. So for this to be zero, r_x + i r_y = 0.

But r_x and r_y are real numbers, right? Because r is a real vector. So the only way this sum is zero is if both r_x and r_y are zero. Because if r_x is not zero, then r_y would have to be imaginary, which isn't allowed since they're real components.

So putting it all together, r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. So the vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but what does that mean geometrically? The Bloch sphere represents pure states with vectors of length 1, but mixed states are points inside the sphere. The origin (0,0,0) corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because in this case, the density matrix is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is equally probable in both states |0> and |1>, so it's the maximally mixed state. So it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which would be the center. So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, which is equally probable in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a real vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we find:

1. The diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are \(\frac{1}{2}\), which match the terms \((1 + r_z)/2\) and \((1 - r_z)/2\). Solving these gives \(r_z = 0\).
2. The off-diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are zero, which correspond to the terms \((r_x + i r_y)/2\). Since \(r_x\) and \(r_y\) are real, this implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

From the options:
- **A)** \(r = (1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B)** \(r = (0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as this represents a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the mixed state.
- **C)** \(r = (0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.
- **D)** \(r = (1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
