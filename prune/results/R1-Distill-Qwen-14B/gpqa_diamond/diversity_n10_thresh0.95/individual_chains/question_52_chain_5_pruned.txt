Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. 

First, let me read the problem again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but how does that happen? Oh right, when spots cover part of the star, they are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the observed effective temperature is a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas. But wait, in this question, when 40% is spotted, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's overall brightness or temperature changes, but I'm more interested in the photospheric conditions in the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So we're considering the LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) in the photosphere.

The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. I think Ti lines are often used in stellar spectroscopy to determine temperatures because the ionization balance depends on temperature.

So the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if the energy levels are E1 and E2, and assuming E2 > E1, then higher temperatures make the exponential term larger, which increases the ratio.

Wait, no. Let me think. The ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential increases. So higher temperatures mean a higher ratio of n2/n1. Because more atoms will be in the higher energy level when it's hotter.

But wait, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But the star's surface isn't uniformly at that temperature, right? Because 40% is covered by cooler spots, and 60% is at higher temperature (the original 6000 K). Or is the overall Teff an average?

Wait, no, the Teff is the effective temperature as measured from the star's luminosity and radius. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the total luminosity is reduced because the spotted areas are cooler. The effective temperature is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σ Teff⁴. So when 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature, the average Teff would decrease.

But in this problem, the given Teff when 40% is covered is 5500 K. So the overall star's photosphere is a mix of two regions: 60% at 6000 K (unspotted) and 40% at a lower temperature (spots). But for the purpose of the problem, the 'overall photospheric effective temperature' is 5500 K. So perhaps when considering the spectrum, the observed continuum is at 5500 K, but the line formation might be in different regions.

But wait, the question says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of Ti neutral atoms, this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio of n2/n1 is lower than when it doesn't. 

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio n2/n1 depends on temperature. So if the temperature is lower, the ratio n2/n1 would decrease, because the exponential term would be smaller. So when the star has spots, if the effective temperature is lower, then the ratio would be smaller. But according to the problem, the ratio does decrease when the star has spots. So that aligns with that. 

But wait, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots (Teff = 6000 K) compared to when it does (Teff = 5500 K). So when the star has no spots, the ratio is higher, and when it has spots, the ratio is lower. So we're to find (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K.

Wait, no. Let me check. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots would be greater than 1. So the factor is a number bigger than 1.

Let me think about the formula. The ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming g2/g1 is the same in both cases, which I think it is because the problem doesn't mention any change in the statistical weights.

So the ratio when no spots: R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), where T1 =6000 K.

When spots: R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), T2=5500 K.

So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, wait: let me re-express it. Because R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, no, because negative signs: R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, no: Let's compute it step by step.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is equal to exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( -1/T1 + 1/T2 ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) )

Yes, that's right.

So we can compute that.

But what's ΔE? We don't have the exact value, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference is related to the photon energy. So we can compute ΔE using the photon energy equation.

Energy E = hc / λ. So ΔE = hc / λ.

Where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is 1448 Å which is 1448e-10 meters.

Compute ΔE:

E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) 

Let me calculate that numerically.

First, compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) * 1e-15 J.

1.9878 / 1448 ≈ 0.001373, so E ≈ 0.001373e-15 J = 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But since each photon corresponds to an energy level difference, ΔE = E = 1.373e-18 J.

But we need this in terms of eV or something more manageable. Let me convert J to eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV.

But wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878 /1448 * 1e-15 J.

1e-15 J is 1 pJ.

1.9878 / 1448 ≈ 0.001373, so 1.373e-3 *1e-15 J = 1.373e-18 J.

Then in eV: 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So yes, ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV.

But wait
