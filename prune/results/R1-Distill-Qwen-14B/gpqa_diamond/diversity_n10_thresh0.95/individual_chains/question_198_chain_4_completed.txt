Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, β is the formation constant, which tells us how stable a complex is. Higher β means more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex: Co(SCN)n^2− where n is 1, 2, 3, 4.

The blue dithiocyanato complex... I think dithiocyanato means two SCN- ions attached. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)2]^2−. But wait, the options are about the percentage—so I need to find the fraction of all Co species that are in this [Co(SCN)2]^2− form.

But wait, the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So that's referring to the Co with two SCN- ligands. But sometimes the complexes can have different colors depending on the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)]^2− might be pink, and [Co(SCN)2]^2− is blue. But the exact colors might not matter here as the question refers specifically to the blue one, which is the dithiocyanato.

So I need to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)2]^2− relative to all the possible Co species in solution. The possible complexes are Co(SCN)^2−, Co(SCN)2^2−, Co(SCN)3^2−, Co(SCN)4^2−, and any free Co^2+ ions? Or wait, wait—no, in this case, the question says "the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M." Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Does c(Co) represent the total Co, including all the complexes? Or is c(Co) the concentration of free Co^2+ ions?

Wait, no. Usually, when someone says the total concentration of a metal ion in solution, they mean the sum of all species of that metal. So c(Co) should be the sum of [Co^2+] plus all the complexed forms. So c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^2− + [Co(SCN)2]^2− + [Co(SCN)3]^2− + [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

But in this problem, the initial solution has Co^2+ and SCN^- ions. So the Co^2+ will form complexes with SCN^- according to the stability constants provided. So what's the approach here?

I think I need to use the stability constants to find the distribution of each complex and then find the fraction that is [Co(SCN)2]^2−.

Stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit odd because β typically increases with n. Let me see the β values: β1 is 9, β2 is 40, β3 is 63, and β4 is 16. So for n=1 to 4, the stability increases up to n=3 (β3=63) and then drops for n=4 (β4=16). That's interesting. So the most stable is the trithiocyanato complex, followed by the dithiocyanato, then the monothiocyanato, and the tetra is the least stable? Hmm, that might affect the distribution.

But wait, in this case, the β for each complex is the stability constant for the nth complex. So βn = [Co(SCN)_n^2−]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). So for each complex, we can write the expression.

But the problem is that the formation of these complexes depends on the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

We have [SCN^-] = 0.1 M, which is 1e-1 M. The total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. Let me denote the free Co^2+ as x. Then, the concentrations of each complex can be expressed in terms of x and the β values.

So let's model this.

Let’s denote [Co^2+] = x.

Then,

[CoSCN^2−] = β1 * x * [SCN^-]^1 = 9 * x * (0.1) = 0.9x.

[Co(SCN)2^2−] = β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 x * 0.01 = 0.4 x.

[Co(SCN)3^2−] = β3 * x * [SCN^-]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 x * 0.001 = 0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)4^2−] = β4 * x * [SCN^-]^4 =16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 x * 0.0001 = 0.0016 x.

Wait, but I’m not sure if that's correct. Because each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So for each n:

[Co(SCN)_n^2−] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n.

But wait, that's only if n SCN- ions are added stepwise. Alternatively, the overall formation constant would be the product of the stepwise β's. Wait, no, I think the βn given is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ions.

So the expressions are correct as written.

Now, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

Wait, let's compute the sum:

x (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 1e-2.

Let's compute the coefficients:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3; 2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363; 2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.

So 2.3646 x = 1e-2 → x = 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0042245 M.

Wait, let me compute that accurately:

1e-2 is 0.01.

0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0042245 M.

So [Co^2+] = x ≈ 0.0042245 M.

Now, compute each complex's concentration:

[CoSCN^2−] = 0.9 x ≈ 0.9 * 0.0042245 ≈ 0.003802 M.

[Co(SCN)2^2−] = 0.4 x ≈ 0.4 * 0.0042245 ≈ 0.0016898 M.

[Co(SCN)3^2−] = 0.063 x ≈ 0.063 * 0.0042245 ≈ 0.000266 M.

[Co(SCN)4^2−] = 0.0016 x ≈ 0.0016 * 0.0042245 ≈ 0.00000676 M.

Wait, let me check those calculations again.

Wait, actually, I think I made a mistake in the expressions. Because when you have the formation constants, the concentration of each complex isn't just β_n * x * [SCN^-]^n. Because each subsequent complex formation depends on the previous steps. Wait, no, the way I set it up earlier is correct only if βn is the cumulative formation constant. Because the way I wrote it earlier, each βn is the overall constant for forming the nth complex. So the formula is correct.

But wait, no. Because the way stability constants are defined, they can be either cumulative (overall) or stepwise. I need to make sure which one these β values are. For example, β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, β2 is for the second, etc., but if they are stepwise, then the overall β for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Because I think the problem states that these are the stability constants for each complex, so they're the overall ones, not stepwise. So for the first complex, [CoSCN^2−], the β is 9. For the second, [Co(SCN)2^2−], the β is 40, which would be the overall constant for forming that complex from Co^2+ and two SCN-.

But that's not possible because the formation of [Co(SCN)2]^2− would involve first forming [CoSCN]^2−, then adding another SCN−. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)2]^2− would be β1 multiplied by β2', where β2' is the stepwise constant for adding the second SCN−.

Wait, maybe the given β values are the stepwise formation constants. Oh wait, the problem states "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Hmm, so perhaps β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^2−, β2 is for [Co(SCN)2]^2−, etc., as stepwise. No, wait, that's not correct because stepwise would be each step, but the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^2− would be the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formation of each complex step by step, using the stepwise β's. So for example, β1 is the constant for Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^2−. Then β2 is the constant for CoSCN^2− + SCN^- → Co(SCN)2^2−, and so on.

In that case, the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^2− is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, but the problem states that the "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16." So perhaps each βn is the cumulative constant for the nth complex. So, β1 is [CoSCN^2−]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-] ), β2 is [Co(SCN)2^2−]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 ), etc.

If that's the case, then the expressions I used earlier are correct. So [Co(SCN)_n]^2− = βn x (SCN^-)^n.

Wait, but then the problem arises when considering that to form [Co(SCN)_2]^2−, it's possible either to go directly or through [CoSCN]^2−. But in the way I've set up the problem earlier, maybe I'm not accounting for the fact that [Co(SCN)_2]^2− can form from [CoSCN]^2−.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the approach. Let me think again.

Another approach is to consider that each complex can form in a stepwise manner, and each step has its own β.

For example, the first complex is [CoSCN]^2− with β1=9.

The second complex is [Co(SCN)2]^2−, which can form from [CoSCN]^2− + SCN^- with β2=40.

The third complex is [Co(SCN)3]^2−, formed from [Co(SCN)2]^2− + SCN^- with β3=63.

The fourth complex is [Co(SCN)4]^2−, formed from [Co(SCN)3]^2− + SCN^- with β4=16.

In this case, the overall stability constants are the products of the stepwise βs up to that step.

So, the overall β for [CoSCN]^2− is β1=9.

The overall β for [Co(SCN)2]^2− is β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360.

The overall β for [Co(SCN)3]^2− is β1 * β2 * β3 =9*40*63=22680.

The overall β for [Co(SCN)4]^2− is 9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, but these β values would be enormous, which would mean the higher complexes are more stable, but wait, the β4 as given is 16, which is lower than β3. That doesn't make sense if they're stepwise. Because each subsequent step would have to have a positive contribution. But β4=16 is less than β3=63. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the given βs are not stepwise but cumulative. So β1 is the overall for [CoSCN]^2−, β2 is the overall for [Co(SCN)2]^2−, etc.

In that case, the expressions I used earlier are correct. Let me go back.

In that scenario, the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^2− = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n.

So, for each n, [Co(SCN)_n]^2− = βn * x * (0.1)^n.

So, the total Co is x + sum over n of [Co(SCN)_n]^2−.

So, the sum is x + β1 x (0.1) + β2 x (0.1)^2 + β3 x (0.1)^3 + β4 x (0.1)^4 = total Co = 1e-2.

Let me compute each term:

β1 *0.1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

β3*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

β4*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So, the sum is x (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x * 2.3646 = 1e-2.

So x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0042245 M.

Now, the concentrations of each complex are:

[CoSCN]^2− = 0.9 x ≈ 0.9 * 0.0042245 ≈ 0.003802 M.

[Co(SCN)2]^2− = 0.4 x ≈ 0.4 * 0.0042245 ≈ 0.0016898 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^2− = 0.063 x ≈ 0.000266 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^2− = 0.0016 x ≈ 0.00000676 M.

Now, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. The blue one is [Co(SCN)2]^2−, which is the second complex.

So, the fraction is [Co(SCN)2]^2− / total Co.

Total Co is 1e-2 M.

So, [Co(SCN)2]^2− is 0.0016898 M.

So, percentage = (0.0016898 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.898%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which would match this.

But wait, the option C is 38.1%, which is approximately the [CoSCN]^2− concentration (3.8e-3 / 0.01 = 38%).

Wait, let me recheck. The [Co(SCN)2]^2− is 0.4 x = 0.0016898 M.

So (0.0016898 / 0.01) *100 = 16.898%, which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 16.9% as option D; let me look again.

The options are:

A) 42.3%

B) 25.6%

C) 38.1%

D) 16.9%

Yes, D is 16.9%.

But wait, I thought the blue complex is [Co(SCN)2]^2−, which I've calculated as 16.898%, so the answer would be D.

But wait, the calculation for [Co(SCN)2]^2− is 0.4 x, and with x=0.0042245, that's 0.4 * 0.0042245 = 0.0016898 M.

So in 1 L, that's 0.0016898 mol.

The total Co is 0.01 mol, so 0.0016898 / 0.01 = 0.16898 → 16.898%.

But wait, the options have 16.9% as option D, so that's the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the β3 is 63, which is higher than β2=40, so you'd expect more of the higher complexes, but in this case, because [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is relatively low, maybe the higher complexes aren't that favored.

Wait, but let me double-check my approach. Because this method assumes that the βn are the overall constants, and that each complex is formed directly from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

But if the βn are stepwise, the approach would be different. Let me think about that case.

In the stepwise approach, each βn is the stepwise formation constant. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^2−, β2 is for the addition of the second SCN− to form [Co(SCN)2]^2−, etc.

So, the overall β for [CoSCN]^2− is β1=9.

The overall β for [Co(SCN)2]^2− is β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

Wait, but that would make [Co(SCN)2]^2− much more stable than [CoSCN]^2− since β is higher.

Wait, but in that case, the concentration of each complex would be:

[CoSCN]^2− = β1 x [SCN^-] =9 x 0.1 x x = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)2]^2− = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2 =9*40 x (0.1)^2 x = 360 *0.01 x = 3.6 x.

Wait, but that's a different approach. Wait, no. No, the expression for each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^2− = (β1 β2 ... βn) * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So for n=1, [CoSCN]^2− = β1 x [SCN^-]^1 =9 x 0.1 x x.

Wait, no, the overall β for n=1 is β1=9. So [CoSCN]^2− = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] =9 x x (0.1) =0.9 x.

For n=2, [Co(SCN)2]^2− = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2 = 9*40 x (0.1)^2 = 360 x 0.01 =3.6 x.

Wait a minute, in this approach, the concentration of the second complex would be higher than the first, which would mean that [Co(SCN)2]^2− is much more abundant than [CoSCN]^2−. That's a problem because when I calculate the total, it might not sum up to 0.01 M.

Wait, but in our initial calculation, when using the β as overall, the sum was 2.3646 x =0.01 → x=0.0042245. Now, in the stepwise β approach, the sum would be:

x + β1 x [SCN-] + β1 β2 x [SCN-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [SCN-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN-]^4.

Wait, that's a different sum. Let's compute that:

x + 9 x 0.1 x x + (9*40) x (0.1)^2 x x + (9*40*63) x (0.1)^3 x x + (9*40*63*16) x (0.1)^4 x x.

So,

x + 0.9 x x + 360 * 0.01 x x + (22680) * 0.001 x x + 362880 * 0.0001 x x.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term should be:

For n=1: [CoSCN]^2− = β1 x [SCN-]^1 →9 * x * 0.1 →0.9 x.

For n=2: β1 β2 x [SCN-]^2 →9*40 * x * 0.01 →360 *0.01 x →3.6 x.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me compute each term:

n=0: x → [Co^2+] =x.

n=1: 9 x *0.1 →0.9 x.

n=2: (9 *40) x * (0.1)^2 →360 x * 0.01 →3.6 x.

n=3: (9*40*63) x * (0.1)^3 →22680 x * 0.001 →22.68 x.

n=4: (9*40*63*16) x * (0.1)^4 →362880 x * 0.0001 →36.288 x.

So the sum is:

x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = x (1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) = x * (64.468) = 0.01 M.

So x is 0.01 /64.468 ≈0.00015518 M.

Wait, that's much smaller than before. So [Co^2+] = 0.00015518 M.

Then, the concentrations of each complex:

n=1: 0.9 x = 0.9 * 0.00015518 ≈ 0.00013966 M.

n=2:3.6 x ≈3.6 *0.00015518 ≈0.00055865 M.

n=3:22.68 x ≈22.68 *0.00015518 ≈0.003522 M.

n=4:36.288 x ≈36.288 *0.00015518 ≈0.005636 M.

Wait a second, but then the sum of all species would be:

x=0.00015518,

n=1: 0.00013966,

n=2: 0.00055865,

n=3: 0.003522,

n=4:0.005636.

Adding these up: 0.000155 + 0.00013966 ≈ 0.000295.

Plus 0.00055865 → ~0.000853.

Plus 0.003522 → ~0.004375.

Plus 0.005636 → ~0.01 M. So it adds up correctly.

But wait, in this case, the [Co(SCN)2]^2− is 0.00055865 M, which is 0.00055865 / 0.01 = 5.5865%—but that's not one of the options. So in this approach, the percentage is around 5.5%, which isn't an option, so perhaps the stepwise approach isn't the right way.

But this suggests that the initial approach of considering each βn as the overall constant for the nth complex is correct, leading to option D, 16.9%.

But wait, let me think again about the β definitions. Stability constants can sometimes be presented as either cumulative or stepwise. If the β given are cumulative, then our first approach applies. If they are stepwise, the second approach applies, but that leads to a percentage not matching the options. Hence, perhaps the β are cumulative, and the first approach is correct.

In that case, the percentage for [Co(SCN)2]^2− is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought [Co(SCN)]^2− is 38%—which is option C. Because [CoSCN]^2− is 0.0038 M, which is 38% of 0.01 M. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)2]^2−, which is 16.9%.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁻, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) provided. The total cobalt concentration is given as 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate (SCN⁻) concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Definitions and Approach:
1. **Stability Constants (β):** The given β values represent the cumulative stability constants for the complexes:
   - β₁ = 9 for [CoSCN]²⁻
   - β₂ = 40 for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁻
   - β₃ = 63 for [Co(SCN)₃]²⁻
   - β₄ = 16 for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻

   The concentration of each complex is expressed as:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n]^{2-} = \beta_n \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}] \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}]^{2-} + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2-} + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3]^{2-} + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-} = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
   \]

3. **Solving for Free Co²⁺ ([Co²⁺]):** Let the free cobalt ion concentration be \( x \). Using the expressions for each complex:
   \[
   [\text{CoSCN}]^{2-} = \beta_1 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot x \cdot 0.1 = 0.9x,
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2-} = \beta_2 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4x,
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_3]^{2-} = \beta_3 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063x,
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-} = \beta_4 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x.
   \]

   Substituting these into the total cobalt equation:
   \[
   x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 0.01.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   x \cdot (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 0.01,
   \]
   \[
   x \cdot 2.3646 = 0.01 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.0042245 \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁻:** Using the expression for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁻:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2-} = 0.4x = 0.4 \cdot 0.0042245 \approx 0.0016898 \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁻:** The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2-}}{\text{Total Co}} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{0.0016898}{0.01} \right) \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁻, among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.

Answer: D
