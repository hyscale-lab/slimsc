Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. It's a question about the possible decay modes of a boson X. The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term, and the mass of the boson is 6 GeV. I need to figure out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. 

Hmm, let's start by understanding the interaction term. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo in the original problem. Let me think—probably, the interaction term is something like L = λ ψ_f^dagger (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So the field X is interacting with fermions ψ_f, which are of some flavor f.

So the interaction term suggests that the boson X can couple to fermions. The decay of X would be into a pair of fermions because the interaction is of the form X ψ ψ. So when X decays, it would produce two fermions. 

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the possible decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Each fermion in the pair will have a mass less than 3 GeV, because 2m < 6 GeV → m <3 GeV.

Wait, no, wait. For a decay X → f f̄, the invariant mass of the fermion pair must be equal to the mass of X. So the individual fermion masses don't matter as much as the sum of their energies. But for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the rest mass of the fermions must be less than half the mass of X. Because each fermion can't have a rest mass greater than X's mass divided by 2. 

So for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the fermion mass m must satisfy m ≤ M_X / 2. M_X is 6 GeV, so m ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV. Way less than 3 GeV. Same with down (d) quark, about 5 MeV.
- Strange (s) quark: ~100 MeV. Still under 3 GeV.
- Charm (c) quark: ~1.5 GeV. Also under 3 GeV.
- Bottom (b) quark: ~4.5 GeV. Oh wait, that's above 3 GeV. So the bottom quark is too heavy.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV. So no way.
- For leptons:
   - Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV. Fine.
   - Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV. Good.
   - Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV. Also under 3 GeV.
   - Neutrinos are negligible, but I don't think they're part of the decay here because the interaction term is probably involving charged leptons or quarks.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. Note that b is too heavy because 4.5 GeV is more than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b bbar.

Wait, but looking again, the interaction term is given as -λ f fbar (ῡ + X) ψf. Hmm, perhaps the notation is a bit tricky. Maybe f and fbar are the same as ψ? Or perhaps the terms are different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling type interaction, where X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

The possible decay channels are X → f f̄. So any fermion pair where the mass is less than 3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are up, down, strange, charm, electron, muon, tau. So the decay channels would include:

uū, ddbar, s sbar, c cbar, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Wait, but wait: the problem's options don't include all of these. Let me check the options again.

Option A) X → b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but earlier I thought that b is too heavy. So option A includes b, which can't happen. So A is out.

Option B) X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

This includes all the light fermions except b. Oh, but where is the top quark? Well, top is way too heavy, so it's not there. So option B has all the allowed fermions except the b and t. Wait, but wait, the option B includes 'c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-'

Wait, but what about the top quark? No, top's mass is 173 GeV, so can't be decayed into.

So the allowed decays are all the fermion pairs except those involving b, c, or t? Wait, no—c is 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV, so c cbar is allowed.

So in the options, the correct decay channels should include all fermion pairs where the mass is under 3 GeV. So that's u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So looking at the options, option B includes all these except b. Let me recheck the options:

Option A: includes b and e, etc. So since b is 4.5 GeV, X can't decay into b bbar, so A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all the light fermions except the b and t. But wait, why is the c included? Because 1.5 GeV is less than 3 GeV. So yes, it's allowed.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But t is way too heavy, so t tbar is impossible. So option C can't be correct.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b, which is 4.5 GeV. So same issue as option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the fermion masses. Let me list them:

Electron: ~0.511 MeV → 0.000511 GeV. So way below 3 GeV.

Muon: ~105.7 MeV → ~0.1057 GeV. Also way under.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV. Hmm, 1.78 GeV is less than 3 GeV, so tau is allowed.

Quarks:

Up: ~2 MeV → 0.002 GeV. Under 3 GeV.

Down: same as up.

Strange: ~100 MeV → 0.1 GeV. Under 3.

Charm: ~1.5 GeV. Under 3.

Bottom: ~4.5 GeV. So 4.5 > 3 → can't decay into b bbar.

Top: 173 GeV → way above.

So possible decay channels include all fermion pairs except those involving b or t.

So the boson X can decay into any of the following pairs: uū, ddbar, s sbar, c cbar, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

So looking back at the options, option B includes all of these except the t, which is not present.

Option B is: c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait. What about the possibility of decaying into neutrinos? Could X decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs? The problem's Lagrangian isn't given completely, but the interaction term given is L = something involving ψ_f, which I assume refers to charged fermions, because neutrinos are neutral. So if the interaction is with charged fermions, then neutrinos wouldn't be part of the decay. Unless the interaction is via Yukawa coupling with neutrinos, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

So, the possible decay modes are all the allowed charged fermions whose mass is under 3 GeV.

So the correct options are those that include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking back, option B includes all except the t and b, which are too heavy.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that includes all light fermions except the b. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but wait another thing: the interaction term is given as -λ f fbar (ῡ + X) ψf.

Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Maybe the interaction is more like L = λ ψ_f^dagger (ῡ + X) ψ_f, where ψ_f is a left-handed fermion field, and f is a right-handed field? Or perhaps it's a general Yukawa interaction. 

In any case, the important point is that X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair. So any fermion species for which the mass is less than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

So the correct answer should include the fermion pairs where each fermion has mass < 3 GeV.

Therefore, the allowed decays are all the above except the b and t. So in the options, option B includes all these except the b, so it's correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decay modes of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided suggests that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, and the decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is possible if the fermion mass \( m_f \) satisfies \( m_f \leq M_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fermion Mass Constraints**: For \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the fermion mass \( m_f \) must satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This eliminates fermions with masses exceeding this threshold, such as the bottom quark (\( b \), \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)) and the top quark (\( t \), \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)).

2. **Allowed Fermions**:
   - **Quarks**: \( u, d, s, c \) (masses \( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - **Leptons**: \( e, \mu, \tau \) (masses \( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - **Excluded**: \( b, t \) (masses \( > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

3. **Decay Channels**: The allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden (\( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Incorrect**.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is kinematically forbidden (\( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Incorrect**.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden (\( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \).

**Answer: B**
