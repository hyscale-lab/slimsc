Okay, so I've got this SMEFT question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about SMEFT and symmetries.

SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. I remember that it's a framework that includes the Standard Model (SM) as a low-energy limit and incorporates higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the SM physics. These operators are classified by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc.

Now, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. I need to figure out which of these are required.

Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, SMEFT is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM Lagrangian. The SM itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so any operator added must also preserve this. Otherwise, if an operator didn't, the theory wouldn't make sense because Lorentz symmetry is fundamental in high-energy physics. So I think Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely one of them.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SM respects Poincare symmetry, and SMEFT is built by adding terms that are compatible with the SM's symmetries. So do SMEFT operators need to respect Poincare? Or can they violate it? Hmm. Wait, Poincare includes translational invariance. SMEFT operators are local, meaning they don't break Poincare? Because if an operator breaks Poincare, like if it's non-local or depends on the position in a way that's not compatible, that would be a problem. But I think all the operators in SMEFT are local, so they should respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, but wait, no. Actually, some higher-dimension operators could have derivatives, but derivatives are part of the Poincare group. Or maybe they don't break it? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, considering that the SM respects Poincare, and SMEFT is an extension, the operators should maintain that. So I think Poincare symmetry (option 2) is also a must.

Wait, wait a second. Poincare symmetry includes not just Lorentz but also translations. So if an operator breaks translation invariance, it would be a problem. But all the operators in SMEFT are built as local operators, so they shouldn't break that. So yes, Poincare symmetry is respected. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, CP symmetry. I'm not as sure about this. The SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry; some of its terms can violate CP, like the CKM matrix. For example, the strong force is supposed to conserve CP, but the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry suggests something's up, but that's another topic. In SMEFT, do the operators necessarily respect CP? I don't think so. Because if you have operators that violate CP, they can be part of the theory. For instance, the dimension six operators include terms like (S U U), where S is the Higgs, which might have CP-conserving and violating parts. So operators can violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry isn't necessarily respected by all operators. So option 3 (CP) isn't a must.

CPT symmetry. Hmm, CPT is a big one in quantum field theory. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. So if the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, then it must respect CPT. Because CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Lorentz symmetry implies CPT symmetry because of the way fields transform under these operations. So any operator in SMEFT, which respects Lorentz, must also respect CPT. So option 4 (CPT) is definitely required.

So putting it all together, which options must be respected by all operators? Lorentz (1) and CPT (4) must be, and Poincare (2) as well. Wait, but earlier I thought Poincare (2) is necessary. Wait, but wait, Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz and translations. So if the operators respect Lorentz and translations, then Poincare is respected. But in the options, option A is 1 and 2, which is Lorentz and Poincare. Option C is 1,2,4, and D is 1,3,4.

Wait, but does the question mean which are required? Because if Poincare is a subset of what's required (since it's part of SMEFT), but perhaps I'm mixing up whether the operators must respect each symmetry.

Wait, let me think again. The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz symmetry, it's not allowed. Same with CPT. But for Poincare, are all operators required to respect it? Because SMEFT is built in a way that the Lagrangian is invariant under Poincare. So yes, the operators must be local, so they must respect Poincare. So that would make options 1, 2, and 4 as required. But looking at the choices, option C is 1,2,4. But wait, I thought that CP isn't necessarily required. So the correct answer would include 1,2,4.

But wait, let me think again about Poincare. Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the SM, so it must also respect Poincare. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare. So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. But wait, the choices in the options are:

Options:
A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So according to this, the correct answer would be C) 1,2,4. But wait, earlier I thought that all operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, but do they necessarily respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, which operators in SMEFT are local, so yes, they must respect that.

Wait, but wait another thought: SMEFT is constructed in a way that the Lagrangian is Poincare invariant. So any operator added must not break that. So all operators must respect Poincare. Thus, 1,2,4 are required.

But wait, I'm a little confused. Because when you add higher-dimension operators, do they necessarily respect Poincare? For example, if an operator includes terms that are non-local, like integrating over some other variable, would that break Poincare? But in SMEFT, all the operators are local and written in terms of the SM fields, so they should respect Poincare. So yes, 1,2,4 must be respected.

Wait, but wait again. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if the operators are local, they are built from local field products, so they should respect both Lorentz and translations. So SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So all three: 1,2,4 must be respected.

But looking back, the option C is 1,2,4. So the correct choice would be C.

But wait, I thought that CPT is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry. So if the theory respects Lorentz, it automatically respects CPT. So CPT is a must. So in the options, 4 is included. So the correct answer must include 1,2,4.

But wait, the initial options: which symmetries must be respected. So the correct options are 1,2,4. So option C is '1,2,4', which is option C.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the possible answers might not include C. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry isn't a separate condition. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Lorentz and translation, then it respects Poincare. So, if the question is whether all operators must respect the symmetries, and option 2 is Poincare. So Poincare (2) is a must, so the answer includes 1,2,4.

But, wait a moment, I'm not entirely sure about Poincare. Because sometimes, when you write the Lagrangian, you have to respect Poincare, which includes translation invariance. So all terms in the Lagrangian must be translation invariant, which is automatically satisfied if the operators are written as local terms. Therefore, all SMEFT operators are Poincare invariant. So option 2 must be included.

So the correct answer would be option C, which is 1,2,4.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer is C.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people might not consider Poincare as a separate symmetry that needs to be explicitly checked, because it's built into the theory. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: In SMEFT, operators are classified by their Lorentz structure, which implies Lorentz symmetry is a must. CPT must be respected because the theory is Lorentz invariant, so CPT is a must. Poincare includes Lorentz and translation, so if translation is respected (which it is, because operators are local), then Poincare is respected. So 1,2,4 are all required.

So the correct answer is C) 1,2,4.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry in the context of SMEFT's framework:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian. Since the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, all SMEFT operators must also preserve it. Lorentz symmetry is fundamental in high-energy physics, and any operator violating it would render the theory inconsistent. Thus, Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry encompasses Lorentz symmetry and translational invariance. SMEFT operators are local and constructed from SM fields, ensuring that translational invariance is preserved. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT operators must also respect it. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry (option 2) is required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not have a global CP symmetry, and certain terms in the SM, such as the CKM matrix, violate CP. SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP, as they represent extensions beyond the SM. Thus, CP symmetry (option 3) is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental property of all Lorentz-invariant theories. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, CPT symmetry (option 4) is a must.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
