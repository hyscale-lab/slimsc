Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me see. The question is about identifying a compound based on IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI—that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, no, wait. Hunsdiecker is for alkyl halides to form alkenes, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI is used to cleave double bonds, especially in the case of alkenes, to form dihalides. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh, wait, the presence of red phosphorus and HI could be a dehydrohalogenation scenario, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, sometimes it's used to cleave alkenes. Oh, right, the reaction of alkenes with HI in the presence of red phosphorus is a way to break the double bond. Or wait, wait, perhaps it's the other way around: maybe this is for the hydrolysis of a bromoalkene or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here, but I'll get back to that after I figure out what the original compound is.

First, let's parse the IR and NMR data for Compound X.

IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests an -OH stretch or maybe an alkyne (sp-hybridized C-H stretch), but 3400-2500 is a broad range. Wait, but 3400-2500 is a broad absorption, maybe an -OH. The other peaks are 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or acid). Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So that suggests an aromatic ring with substituents.

The 1H NMR data: Let's go through it.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's probably an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols might be around 1-5 ppm, but if it's an acid, it's usually broad and around 10-12 ppm.

But wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR could be a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which fits. The IR shows 1720, which is a bit higher, but maybe it's an ester or an acid. But the broad peak at 10.5 could be an -OH, so maybe it's a benzoic acid or similar.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons, doublet. This is likely on an aromatic ring, para-substituted. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons on one side would be a doublet. So if we have something like p-methylbenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be split into a doublet each.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also a doublet, but perhaps the other set of aromatic protons. So, let's say in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons on one carbon would be a doublet, and the two on the other adjacent would be another doublet. So in a para substitution, like 4-something, the protons would split into two doublets.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to one proton. That might be a CH group adjacent to something else, maybe a carbonyl or another substituent. Like a CH connected to a carbonyl group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons in a multiplet. Could be part of an alkyl chain, perhaps adjacent to a CH group. Like maybe a CH2-CH- group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three hydrogens as a doublet, meaning a CH2 connected to a CH3. So maybe a CH(CH3) group, where the CH is split into a doublet due to coupling with neighboring protons.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to three protons, which is typically a terminal CH3 group, like in an ethyl or propyl chain. So that's probably a methyl group at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the structure seems to involve a benzene ring with substituents, one of which is a carbonyl group (from the IR 1720 cm-1 and the -OH in NMR), and another substituent that's an alkyl chain.

Let's think about the NMR:

The aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm as doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but in the case of a meta substitution, you get different splitting. So perhaps one substituent is the carbonyl (like a COOH group) and another is an alkyl chain. But wait, let me think—wait, the IR has a strong carbonyl, and the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 which could be an -OH (from a carboxylic acid), so perhaps the substituent is a COOH group, making it benzoic acid derivative.

But then, looking at the other substituent: the NMR shows a CH group (at 2.9 ppm), then adjacent is CH2 (1.7 ppm), then a CH3 (1.4 ppm), and another CH3 (0.9 ppm). So the substituent on the benzene is a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to something. Alternatively, let's think step by step.

The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH. So perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Because the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl adjacent to a CH group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, but wait, no. Wait, a sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), and sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene is a group R, which is a chain with a branch. Let's imagine the substituent is something like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's a pentyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Alternatively, looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group that's split into a multiplet. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 attached to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to that CH2. And the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3 attached to another CH2. So the chain would be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be because the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (so maybe a CH2 adjacent to a CH3).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch. Let me try to draw the structure based on the NMR.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl (CH3) group attached to a CH2. So the structure would have a CH3-CH2-..., but the next group is the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which is a CH2. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH.

So putting it together: CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-..., but wait, no, because the 2.9 ppm is a CH (1H) which is connected to what?

Alternatively, let me model it as:

The substituent on benzene is a group like CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't fit all the signals. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. Wait, no: a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, butyl groups:

- n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3
- iso-butyl: -CH(CH2CH3)2 (but that's not correct, iso-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3? No, correct structure: iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, actually, iso-butyl is -CH2C(CH3)2. No, wait. Let's clarify:

Butyl groups:

1. n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (straight chain)
2. iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2 (where the branching is on the second carbon)
3. sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3) (but that doesn't make sense because the substituent would be on the third carbon; perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that might not fit.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the NMR splitting.

The 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), so it's a CH3 attached to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H), so that's a CH2 attached to another CH. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH.

So the structure would be:

CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is connected to a CH3. So like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would make the substituent a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch on the middle carbon.

Wait, if the substituent is a group like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-X, where X is another group. But in this case, the 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to CH, which is at 2.9 ppm. Then, the 1.7 ppm is a CH2 attached to that CH. Then the 0.9 ppm is a CH3 attached to the CH2.

So perhaps the structure is benzene with substituents: one is a COOH group, and the other is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group with a branch. Or maybe a butyl group.

Wait, but let me count the carbons. The substituent on the benzene is probably a R group which is a chain: from the NMR, it's a CH3 (0.9) connected to a CH2 (1.7) connected to a CH (2.9) connected to a benzene? Or maybe the substituent is a benzoate ester or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So like a sec-propyl group? No, perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene. That would give us a structure where the 0.9 ppm is the terminal CH3, the 1.7 is the CH2 next to it, then the CH at 2.9, which is connected to the benzene.

But wait, the 1.4 ppm is a CH3 as a doublet. Oh, wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, which is attached to the benzene.

Wait, let me try to sketch this:

Benzene ring with two substituents: one is a COOH group (since the IR has a strong carbonyl and the NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm for the -OH), and the other substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group. But the NMR doesn't quite fit that. The isopropyl group would have a CH(CH3)2, which would show a septet around 1.2 ppm, but here the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me think: the 0.9 ppm is a CH3 attached to a CH2 (that's the 1.7 ppm as a CH2), which then connects to a CH (2.9 ppm), which is connected to another CH3 (1.4 ppm as a doublet). So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but arranged as a substituent on the benzene.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group? No, perhaps a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, putting it all together: the substituent on benzene is a group like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-..., but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the central CH. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CO-... No, but that would be an ester, which might not fit the IR. Wait, the IR has 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester or a ketone or an acid.

Wait, but the NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) than an ester or a ketone, because esters don't have an -OH proton. So maybe the substituent is a benzoic acid group.

So, benzene ring with a COOH group (para position?) and another substituent which is an alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, each a doublet. So that suggests the benzene has two substituents in para positions, making the ring para-disubstituted. One substituent is COOH, and the other is an alkyl group.

So the structure would be, for example, p-(alkyl)benzoic acid.

So the substituents are on opposite ends of the benzene ring. So, positions 1 and 4.

So, the IR has a strong carbonyl (1720 cm-1), which is consistent with a carboxylic acid (usually around 1700 cm-1, but maybe higher if it's an acid with strong hydrogen bonding or another group affecting it).

The NMR has the aromatic protons as two doublets, which aligns with a para-substituted benzene. So, the substituents are on carbons 1 (COOH) and 4 (R group), making it 4-(R)benzoic acid.

Now, looking at the substituent R. The NMR shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm (1H), adjacent to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), which is adjacent to a CH3 (1.4 ppm, 3H), and the terminal CH3 is at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). So the substituent R is a chain that's something like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that would be a pentyl group, but the substituent is probably a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps R is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But that would have a substituent with four carbons. Let's think: the substituent would be a butyl group with a branch. For example, a sec-butyl group would have the structure CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but let's think about the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but then the substituent would be a pentyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it an isopropyl group attached to a CH2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene. But the NMR doesn't fit that because the CH(CH3) would be split into a septet if it's adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, the substituent R is probably a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Let me count:

- The 0.9 ppm is a CH3 attached to a CH2.
- That CH2 is at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- That CH2 is connected to a CH at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).
- The CH is connected to a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

Wait, that would make the structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene? That structure would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the middle carbon. So, structure: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would make it a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. But the NMR doesn't quite fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it an isopropyl group attached to the benzene via a CH2.

Wait, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, then the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-. But that would leave the NMR signals as:

- The CH(CH3) would have a triplet (if adjacent to CH2), but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should look at the options given to see which structure matches the data.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, let's analyze each option.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. Wait, but the numbering is a bit off. Alternatively, propanoic acid attached to a benzene ring at position 2, and the benzene has an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, but the structure would have a benzene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 4: a propanoic acid group at position 2 and an ethyl at position 4. Would that match the NMR? Let's see.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be split into different patterns. Also, the NMR would have peaks corresponding to the ethyl group. But the given NMR has a terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm, which is more consistent with a longer chain.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4. Let me see. Benzoic acid has a COOH group, and a substituent at para position, which is a sec-butyl.

A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. A sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is:

The butyl group is four carbons. The point of attachment is on the second carbon. So it's -CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, no. Let me think: for a butyl group, the four carbons are arranged as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 for n-butyl. For iso-butyl, it's (CH3)2CH-CH2-. Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH(CH3)2CH2-.

Wait, no. The substituents:

- n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3
- iso-butyl: -CH(CH3)CH2CH3 (but that's not correct; iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2.
Wait, perhaps a better way is to write the structure:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3
iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)2 (i.e., the substituent is on the second carbon, with two methyl groups)
sec-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify:

A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the four carbons in a butyl group. The "sec" refers to the position of the attachment. For butyl groups, the "sec" would be when the attachment is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think about the substituent as:

sec-butyl group: the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, that would be a pentyl group? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look at each option and see which NMR matches.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure is benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The substituent on the benzene would be a sec-butyl group.

What's the structure of a sec-butyl group? It's a four-carbon group where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurately:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that would be a pentyl group. Wait, no, a butyl group has four carbons. So, the substituent would be four carbons arranged in a way that the attachment is on the second carbon.

So, the substituent would be: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon group? No, CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- is three carbons. Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

No, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again.

Butyl groups:

n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3

iso-butyl: -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-

sec-butyl: -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, maybe I should just look up the structure of a sec-butyl group. Oh wait, perhaps it's:

The substituent is a four-carbon chain where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that's three carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it a butyl group, but with the substituent on the second carbon.

But perhaps I should think about the NMR of option C.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, then the structure would be: benzene ring with -COOH at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1? Wait, no, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, so the COOH is at position 1 (assuming the numbering starts with the COOH as position 1), and the substituent is at position 4.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the substituent:

sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that's a four-carbon group:

- The first carbon is attached to the benzene (position 1).
- The second carbon is CH- attached to the first.
- The third carbon is CH2.
- The fourth is CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Maybe the substituent is a four-carbon group where the attachment is on the second carbon:

So, the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that's only three carbons. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. No, that would be a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should look back at the NMR data. Let's consider the substituent R as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group.

But perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, which has a longer chain.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm, which is a single proton, then a CH2 at 1.7, then a CH3 at 1.4, and a CH3 at 0.9. So the substituent is:

CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-

Wait, but that would make the substituent a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, which is a butyl group with a branch. So, the substituent would be a pentyl group? No, perhaps a butyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That's a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, in that case, the NMR would have:

- CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) attached to a CH2.
- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), where the CH is connected to the benzene.
- The attached CH3 from CH(CH3) would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

That fits exactly with the NMR data given.

So, the substituent on the benzene is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a 2-methylbutyl group. Because pentyl is five carbons, but here it's four carbons with a methyl branch.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group, but I'm not entirely sure.

In any case, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch, making it a sec-butyl group. Because the substituent is attached to the benzene via the second carbon.

So, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would match option C.

Wait, but let's check the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring, which is para to the COOH group.

So, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group. Let's think about the structure of a sec-butyl group.

A sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that's three carbons. Oh, no, wait, but I think I'm mixing up the terminology. Let me look it up mentally: the four carbons in a butyl group.

n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3

iso-butyl: -CH(CH3)CH2CH2-

Wait, no, iso-butyl is -(CH2)2C(CH3)2? No, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I should stop trying to figure out the substituent's structure and instead think about the NMR.

In option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the NMR for that substituent would be:

The terminal CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm (because it's attached to a CH2), the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet at ~1.4 ppm (because it's next to a CH), then the CH would be a septet at around 1.7 ppm, but that doesn't fit the given NMR.

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm, which is a single proton, so it must be a CH group connected to two other groups. So, the substituent likely has a CH group in the middle.

Wait, considering that, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

In any case, the structure that fits the NMR is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a substituent that is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, leading to the NMR signals as described.

So, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then option C would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, moving on to the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

As I thought earlier, red phosphorus and HI are typically used to cleave alkenes. Specifically, the reaction is known as the hydrolysis of a halogenated alkene, but perhaps in this case, it's the cleavage of a double bond to form a dihalide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Compound X has a benzyl position with a substituent that can undergo elimination to form a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination reaction where an alkyl halide is formed. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but I think the reaction of red phosphorus and HI is more about the cleavage of alkenes. For example, when an alkene is treated with HI and red phosphorus, the double bond is broken, and each carbon adds an HI molecule, leading to the formation of two carbocations, which then trap iodide ions.

Wait, no, actually, the reaction of alkenes with HI in the presence of red phosphorus is a way to effect the hydroboration or something else? No, maybe it's for the cleavage of alkenes to form diiodides.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the dehydrohalogenation, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think: the original compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If it's treated with HI and red phosphorus, what would happen?

Alternatively, perhaps Compound X isn't an acid but an ester. Wait, let me double-check the IR. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which can correspond to an ester (usually around 1740-1720 cm-1), a ketone (around 1700 cm-1), or a carboxylic acid (around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes higher). 

Wait, but the NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) than an ester. So, the compound is likely a benzoic acid derivative.

But then, reacting benzoic acid with HI and red phosphorus—perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but benzoic acid is not a good substrate for substitution.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is a bromide or another leaving group, and the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But in this case, the substituent is an alkyl group, not a halide.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the reaction conditions.

Red phosphorus and HI: I think this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, but more likely, it's used to break a double bond. So, perhaps the original compound has a double bond.

Wait, but the IR data doesn't show a peak for a double bond. Oh wait, the IR has a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound has an aromatic ring, which explains that peak.

So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group that can undergo some reaction with HI and red phosphorus. Alternatively, maybe the substituent has a double bond.

Wait, let's think about the substituent's structure again. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, does it have any double bonds? No, it's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group or an allyl group, which would have a double bond. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would indicate a double bond, like a triplet of triplets or anything like that. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a bromine or another halogen, but that's not indicated in the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, and when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a cleavage reaction.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a double bond that I'm not considering. For example, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, perhaps it's actually a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 group with a double bond somewhere, but I don't think so.

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show any peaks indicative of a double bond. So maybe the substituent is a single bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI is a way to cleave alkenes or to perform dehydrohalogenation, but perhaps in this case, it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a hydrolysis of an ester. But the original compound is a benzoic acid, not an ester.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a saponification of an ester, but again, the compound is a benzoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromoalkyl group that undergoes elimination.

Wait, but the substituent doesn't seem to have a bromine in the NMR data.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option's structure and reaction.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the substituent undergoes some reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which is for alkyl halides to form alkenes. Wait, no, the Hunsdiecker reaction is when an alkyl halide is treated with red phosphorus and HI to form an alkene and phosphine oxide. So, if the substituent is a bromide or chloride, it would form an alkene.

But in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a halide. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, unless the substituent is a bromo-substituted group, but the NMR doesn't indicate that.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the reaction differently. Maybe the substituent has a leaving group, like a bromide, which would react with HI to form an alkene.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which isn't a leaving group. So perhaps the reaction isn't applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the original compound. Let's consider another option.

Looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, the structure would be benzene with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't support a methyl group. The IR data has a peak at 1720, which would suggest a carbonyl group, but option D doesn't have a carbonyl. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Again, no carbonyl, so the IR wouldn't have a peak at 1720. So the original compound must have a carbonyl group, which points towards option C or A.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

This would have a propanoic acid group attached to a benzene ring which has an ethyl group at the 4-position. But the NMR data doesn't seem to match this, as the substituent would have an ethyl group, leading to a triplet around 1.2 ppm, but in the given data, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

So, the original compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which is a typical condition for the Hunsdiecker reaction, but that requires an alkyl halide. Since our compound doesn't have a halide, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not Hunsdiecker. Another possibility is that red phosphorus and HI are used to perform a substitution reaction on a benzyl halide, but again, the original compound doesn't have a benzyl halide.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a bromo group. Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show any peaks indicative of Br substitution.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the substituent is a nitro group or something else that can react with HI and red phosphorus. But I don't see any nitro peaks in the IR.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not about the substituent but about the benzoic acid group. But benzoic acid reacting with HI and red phosphorus—what would happen?

Benzoic acid can react with HI to form benzoyl iodide, but I'm not sure about the conditions. Red phosphorus is often used as a reducing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group that can undergo some elimination.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but without a halide, I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a bromide. For example, if the substituent is a bromoalkyl group, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus would cleave it to form an alkene. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks for a Br, which would appear as a singlet around 3-4 ppm, but nothing like that is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a chloro group, but again, no peak in the NMR suggests that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the substituent but on the COOH group.

Wait, benzoic acid can react with HI to form benzene and water and ICl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but that usually requires heat.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a bromo group, and the reaction is a substitution. But again, the NMR doesn't suggest that.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group, and the reaction cleaves it.

But the NMR doesn't show any signs of a double bond.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me recap.

The original compound has:

- IR: 3400-2500 (probably -OH), 1720 (carbonyl), 1610 (aromatic C=C), 1450 (aromatic).

- NMR: aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2, indicating para-substituted benzene.

- The substituent is a group that includes a CH group at 2.9, a CH2 at 1.7, a CH3 at 1.4 (d), and a CH3 at 0.9 (t).

So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it a pentyl group with a branch.

Now, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? If the substituent is a bromide, it would form an alkene. But without a bromide, perhaps nothing happens. But that can't be the case since the reaction is given.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a double bond in the substituent. But the substituent as I determined doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of the substituent. Maybe the substituent has a double bond.

Wait, another approach: Suppose the substituent is a propenyl group (-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond).

No, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest a double bond. For example, a vinyl group would have a triplet around 5 ppm, but the given NMR doesn't have such peaks.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring or something else, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group with a bromine on the end, making it a bromide. Then, with red phosphorus and HI, it would undergo elimination to form an alkene.

But the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a bromine.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-Br group, making it a bromoalkyl group. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would cleave it to form an alkene.

So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH2-CH2-Br, and upon reaction, it would form -CH2-CH2-CH2-I and then eliminate to form an alkene.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which isn't brominated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromo-substituted group, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks for Br.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave alkenes into dihalides. For example, if the substituent has a double bond, the reaction would break it and add HI across the double bond.

But without a double bond in the substituent, perhaps this reaction doesn't apply.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl-type group that can undergo some elimination. For example, if the substituent is a benzyl bromide, the reaction would form styrene.

But again, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, not a benzyl bromide.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should look for the answer based on the reaction.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a benzoic acid with HI and red phosphorus might lead to the formation of benzene and water and some iodide, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires a Lewis acid catalyst and an alkyl halide, which doesn't fit here.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it a sec-butyl group, and the reaction conditions cause the substituent to undergo some elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, but without a leaving group, elimination isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, and when treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

But again, without a halide, this doesn't make sense.

Wait, unless the substituent has a halide that's part of the structure, but the NMR doesn't show it.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the structure of the substituent. Let me think again.

The substituent's NMR parts:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): CH3 connected to CH2.
- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): CH2 connected to CH.
- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): CH connected to benzene and another CH2.
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): CH3 connected to CH.

So, the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a branch. The structure is: CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a five-carbon substituent, making it a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

But wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene as a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the middle carbon.

So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would make the substituent a pentyl group.

In that case, the substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

So, the substituent would be a 2-methylbutyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the nomenclature. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group.

In any case, the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch.

So, when this substituent reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it undergoes a cleavage reaction. But without a halide, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't about the substituent but about the benzoic acid group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid iodide. Benzoic acid can react with HI to form benzoyl iodide and water. But the conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are more suited for elimination reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't know.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options again to see which product makes sense.

The options after reaction are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, but the question is to identify the product after reaction. So, the options are the possible products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent is a leaving group. But without a leaving group, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, which can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group, but again, no.

I'm really stuck on this reaction part. Let me think differently.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a benzyl bromide, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would form a benzene ring with a double bond.

But the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, not a benzyl bromide.

Hmm.

Another angle: perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation of the benzoic acid. In the presence of HI and red phosphorus, maybe the acid is decarboxylated to form benzene and release CO2 and HI. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction cleaves it to form a shorter chain.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Let me think of the options again.

The product options don't have any acids except options A and C. The reaction conditions involve HI and red phosphorus, which could be involved in elimination or substitution.

If the original compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the substituent is cleaved, leading to the loss of the substituent and the formation of benzoic acid. But that doesn't make sense, as the substituent is already a part of the benzoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the substituent to form an alkene. But without a leaving group, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a di-substituted alkene, and the reaction cleaves it into two alkenes. But again, the NMR doesn't show any signs of a double bond.

Hmm. Maybe I should think that the reaction doesn't change the substituent but does something else. For example, perhaps the reaction is a saponification, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride. But the conditions don't seem right for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the substituent. Red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. But the substituent is a butyl group; reduction wouldn't do much.

Hmm. I'm really stuck on this reaction part. Maybe I should proceed to the conclusion based on the substituent.

Given the original compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI doesn't change the substituent, perhaps the product remains the same, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into an alkene.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent has a bromide that I didn't account for. Let me re-examine the NMR data for any peaks that suggest a bromide.

The NMR data has peaks at 10.5, 8.0, 7.2, 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9. No peaks in the region where a CH2Br would appear (~3.3-3.7 ppm). So, no, the substituent isn't a bromo group.

Hmm. I'm really not sure about the reaction part. But given the options, perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction cleaves it to form a shorter chain.

But without knowing the exact reaction mechanism, I'm not making progress.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction doesn't change the structure, but that can't be right because the product is the same as the reactant.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into a methyl group, leading to option D.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are a sec-butyl group and a methyl group on the benzene.

But the original compound doesn't have a methyl group; it's a benzoic acid.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol, but that doesn't fit the reaction conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation to form toluene, but I don't see how the substituent would change.

I'm really not making progress here. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

The original compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely cleaves the substituent, leading to the formation of benzoic acid and another product. But without more information, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent undergoes elimination to form an alkene, but without a leaving group, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a bromide that I'm not seeing. For example, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Br group, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would cleave it into -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-I and then eliminate to form an alkene.

But the NMR doesn't show any peaks for Br, so this is unlikely.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the data, the original compound is option C, and the reaction doesn't change it, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into a shorter chain, leading to a different product.

But without a clear understanding of the reaction, I'll have to proceed.


The problem involves identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data and predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Here's the analysis:

### Step 1: Analyzing IR and NMR Data for Compound X
- **IR Data**:
  - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an -OH stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
  - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
  - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a benzene ring.

- **NMR Data**:
  - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid.
  - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
  - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet integrating to 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl or aromatic ring.
  - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet integrating to 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
  - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet integrating to 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
  - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal CH₃ group in an alkyl chain.

From this data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The structure includes a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-) at position 4.

---

### Step 2: Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to cleave alkenes or facilitate elimination reactions. However, the substituent in Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) does not contain a double bond or a leaving group (e.g., halide). Despite extensive analysis, no clear reaction pathway was identified that would alter the structure of the compound under these conditions. The reaction may not proceed or may not lead to a detectable change in the product.

---

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would require an ethyl group on the benzene ring, which is inconsistent with the observed splitting patterns.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure lacks a carbonyl group, which is evident from the IR data (1720 cm⁻¹).
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Matches the IR and NMR data perfectly. The substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4, and the carboxylic acid group is at position 1.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure lacks a carbonyl group, making it inconsistent with the IR data.

---

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not appear to alter the structure, as no plausible reaction pathway was identified. Therefore, the product remains the same as the starting material.

**Answer: C**
