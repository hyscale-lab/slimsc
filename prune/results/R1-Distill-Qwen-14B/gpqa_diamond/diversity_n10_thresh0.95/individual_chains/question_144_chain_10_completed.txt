Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to figure it out step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so the answer should be a length.

Wait, mesons are bosons, right? And since they're particles, their decay involves some quantum mechanics and particle physics principles. Decay distance probably has to do with how far the particle travels before it decays. Oh right, that's related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity.

So I remember that the mean decay length (L) is given by the equation L = c * τ * β * γ, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, β is the velocity over the speed of light (v/c), and γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, how do I find τ from the given data?

The width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime τ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But I'm not sure about the exact formula here. Let me get that straight.

Oh, right! The width Γ is the total decay rate, and it's connected to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something like that. I'll need to convert units carefully.

So first, let's compute τ. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. But Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems right.

Next, I need to find the particle's velocity and Lorentz factor. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). But wait, since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps the calculation is more straightforward.

Wait, in terms of units, E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²). But both E and m are in GeV, so m c² is m * (c² GeV per GeV/c²) → GeV. So E is 8 GeV, m c² is (1.2 GeV) * c². Hmm, but when you have E and m in the same units (GeV), then E/(m c²) is E/(m) because c² is in GeV/(GeV/c²) → GeV/(GeV/c²) * c² = GeV * c² / GeV * c²? Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think differently.

Wait, actually, for particles, E = γ m c² → γ = E / (m c²). But since E and m c² are both in GeV, the ratio is E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) * (c² / c²) → 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Wait, no, because c² is in (m/s)^2, but since both E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c² respectively, perhaps the units are taken into account differently. Maybe I should just compute γ as E / m because the units might work out. Let's see:

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c². So E / (m c²) is (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) → the c² cancels, so it's 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, but wait a minute, is that correct? Because E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²). So with E in GeV and m in GeV/c², let's compute:

m c² = (1.2 GeV/c²) * c² = 1.2 GeV. So E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.6667. So γ is about 6.6667, which is 20/3.

Now, the velocity β is v/c. So β can be found from γ via the relation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So solving for β:

γ² = 1/(1 - β²) → 1 - β² = 1/γ² → β² = 1 - 1/γ².

So let's compute β²:

γ = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667 → γ² = (400)/(9) ≈ 44.4444.

Then 1/γ² = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - β² = 0.0225 → β² = 0.9775 → β ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β is approximately 0.9887, which means v is about 0.9887c.

Now that I have γ and β, I can compute the mean decay length L.

L = c * τ * β * γ.

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute τ: I found τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So c * τ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then multiply by β and γ:

β * γ ≈ 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ let's calculate:

0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ (approx) 0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322, 0.9887 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.6591; sum ≈ 6.5913.

So 6.5913.

So L ≈ 6.170625e-16 m * 6.5913 ≈ let's compute:

6.170625e-16 * 6 = 3.702375e-15.

6.170625e-16 * 0.5913 ≈ approximately 6.170625e-16 * 0.6 is about 3.702375e-16, but since it's 0.5913, perhaps a bit less. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 6.170625e-16 * 6.5913 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 6.170625e-16 * 6.5913 ≈ 6.170625 *6.5913e-16.

6 * 6.5913 is 39.5478.

0.170625 *6.5913 ≈ approximately 1.122.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 6.170625 *6.5913.

Wait, 6 *6.5913 =39.5478.

0.170625 *6.5913 = let's compute 0.170625 *6 =1.02375, 0.170625 *0.5913= approx 0.1009.

So sum 1.02375 + 0.1009 = 1.12465.

So total is 39.5478 +1.12465 =40.67245.

So 6.170625e-16 *6.5913 ≈40.67245e-16 meters =4.067245e-15 meters.

Wait, but wait, 6.170625e-16 is 6.170625 * 1e-16. Multiply by 6.5913 gives (6.170625 *6.5913) *1e-16.

Wait, 6.170625 *6.5913 is approximately 40.67245. So 40.67245e-16 =4.067245e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 *10^-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15. So my calculation gives approximately 4.067e-15, which is close to option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because there might be some approximations I made.

Let me recompute the decay length step by step with more precise values.

First, τ = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 → 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So c*τ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Now, compute β*γ.

γ = E/(m c²) = 8/(1.2) = 6.666666... So 20/3.

β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

γ² = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.44444.

So 1/γ² = 9/400 = 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let me compute more precisely.

What's the square root of 0.9775?

Well, 0.9887^2 is approximately (since 0.98^2=0.9604, 0.988^2=0.976144, 0.9887^2=?

0.9887 * 0.9887:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0087 = 0.017396.

0.0087^2 = 0.00007569.

Sum: 0.9604 +0.017396= 0.977796 +0.00007569= 0.97787169. Which is a bit higher than 0.9775.

So 0.9887^2 ≈0.97787, which is higher than 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9885 or so.

Alternatively, perhaps use linear approximation around x=0.9887:

Let me calculate the square of 0.9885:

0.9885^2 = ?

Well, 0.9885 = 0.98 + 0.0085. So:

(0.98 + 0.0085)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0085 + (0.0085)^2.

0.98^2=0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0085= 0.01666.

(0.0085)^2=0.00007225.

Total: 0.9604 +0.01666=0.97706 +0.00007225=0.97713225.

Hmm, which is still higher than 0.9775? No, wait 0.977132 is lower than 0.9775. So 0.9885^2 ≈0.97713.

Wait, so 0.9885^2 is 0.97713, and 0.9887^2 is about 0.97787. So 0.9775 is between these two. Let me find x such that x^2=0.9775.

We can use linear approximation between 0.9885 and 0.9887.

At x=0.9885, x²=0.97713.

At x=0.9887, x²=0.97787.

The difference between these is about 0.9887² - 0.9885² = (0.9887-0.9885)(0.9887+0.9885) ) = (0.0002)(1.9772)≈0.00039544.

We need to find x where x²=0.9775. The target y is 0.9775, which is between 0.97713 and 0.97787.

The difference from 0.97713 to target is 0.9775-0.97713=0.00037.

The total range is 0.00074 (from 0.97713 to 0.97787).

So fraction = 0.00037 / 0.00074 ≈ 0.5.

So x ≈ 0.9885 + (0.0002)*0.5 = 0.9885 + 0.0001 = 0.9886.

So β ≈0.9886.

Thus, β*gamma = 0.9886 * (20/3) ≈0.9886 *6.6666667 ≈ let's compute exactly:

6.6666667 *0.9886 = let's compute:

0.9886 *6 =5.9316, 0.9886*0.6666667≈0.6590667.

Sum 5.9316 +0.6590667≈6.5906667.

So βγ ≈6.5906667.

Now, cτ = 6.170625e-16 m.

L = cτ * βγ =6.170625e-16 m *6.5906667 ≈6.170625 *6.5906667 × 1e-16.

Multiply 6.170625 ×6.5906667.

Let me compute that:

6 ×6.5906667 =39.544.

0.170625 ×6.5906667 ≈ Let's compute 0.170625 *6=1.02375, 0.170625 *0.5906667≈0.10084.

Adding them gives 1.02375 +0.10084 ≈1.12459.

So total is 39.544 +1.12459 ≈40.66859.

So L ≈40.66859e-16 m =4.066859e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculations of β and gamma or using more precise constants.

Wait a second, in my calculation I used ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s, but sometimes it's approximated as 6.582×10^-25. Let me make sure that's correct.

Yes, ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·seconds.

Another point: When calculating γ, I used E = 8 GeV and m =1.2 GeV/c². So E/(m c²) =8/(1.2) =6.6667 as before.

So the calculation for L is correct, leading to approximately 4.0668e-15 m, which rounds to 4.067e-15. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I miss any factors?

Wait, another approach: The decay length can also be calculated using the formula:

L = (c * τ) * β γ.

Alternatively, sometimes the mean lifetime τ is used, but here we're using proper lifetime, so the calculation seems correct.

So, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.066e-15 m. The closest option is B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \),
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we compute:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Given \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), we compute:

\[
\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9} \approx 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{9}{400} = 0.0225,
\]

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), and \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), we compute:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667.
\]

First, calculate \( c \cdot \tau \):

\[
c \cdot \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Next, calculate \( \beta \cdot \gamma \):

\[
\beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5907.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = (6.170625 \times 10^{-16}) \cdot 6.5907 \approx 4.0668 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 4.0668 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
