Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem involves several reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The steps are:

1. Heating with excess KOH to get product 1.
2. Heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide to get product 2.
3. Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide to form product 3.
4. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

Hmm. Let me think about each step.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH (a strong base) would likely lead to an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. Since it's dibrominated, maybe two E2 reactions happen. But wait, in adamantane derivatives, the structure is quite rigid. So if both bromines are on adjacent carbons (like 1 and 3 positions), elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's imagine the structure: adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent carbons, perhaps across a bridge. When each loses HBr, it forms a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene? Or perhaps, since each elimination gives a double bond, maybe it forms an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds) or a conjugated diene. But wait, with two adjacent bromines, elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 3? Or maybe a bridgehead double bond?

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is such that the 1,3-dibromo groups are on adjacent bridgeheads. So when you eliminate HBr from each, you form a conjugated diene across the bridge. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex structure.

Wait, considering the NMR data of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), likely a CH2 group, possibly next to an oxygen. The IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh, so product 1 has a carbonyl group. That suggests that the initial reaction is not just elimination but maybe elimination followed by some kind of cyclization or oxidation.

Wait, KOH is a strong base. Another possibility is that the dibromide undergoes a nucleophilic substitution. But with excess KOH, and heating, more likely elimination. But the IR has a carbonyl, which suggests that perhaps some kind of oxidation is happening. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH—maybe it's a double E2 elimination, forming an alkene. But then how does a carbonyl form? Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening leading to a diepoxide? Wait, no, because KOH wouldn't form an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? Or maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that usually involves esters. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, but no, that would require an oxide ring, but the IR at 1720 suggests a ketone or ester. So something else.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base like KOH, could undergo a double elimination, but perhaps the base also acts as a nucleophile. Maybe each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a strong carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by hydroxyl groups, but that would give a diol, but the IR doesn't match.

Hmm. Let me think again. The NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H). That seems like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably all the CH2 groups in the adamantane structure.

Wait, if the product is a ketone, then the carbonyl is at 1720. So maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of oxidation?

But wait, KOH is a base. Maybe it's an example of the formation of a ketone via elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the formation of an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Another approach: in the NMR of product 1, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That's a characteristic of a -CH2-O- group. Because if it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, the chemical shift would be around 4 ppm, depending on the environment. So perhaps product 1 is an ether.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone.

Wait, another approach: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Let me think about the possible structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings, and the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent bridgeheads. So, if each bridgehead has a Br, perhaps the reaction forms a bridgehead double bond.

Wait, but if each Br is eliminated, perhaps the structure forms a bridgehead alkyne? No, that's less likely. Alternatively, the elimination would form a double bond, making a bridgehead alkene. But wait, the IR doesn't show a C=C stretch. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? Because sometimes, when two dihalides are heated with a base, they can form cyclopropane via a double elimination. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbocation rearrangement, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the initial product's NMR has 4.79 (2H). That might be a methylene group next to an oxygen. So perhaps the product is an epoxide. But wait, the IR of an epoxide doesn't show a strong peak at 1720. Epoxides have C-O-C, which typically absorb around 1200-1300 cm^-1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with an adjacent CH2-O group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that requires esters. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with excess KOH, elimination is more likely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a diketone. If each Br is replaced by a ketone group, but that would require two elimination steps, which might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated diene. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the NMR and IR data again.

Product 1's IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So it's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the presence of a peak at 1720 suggests more of a ketone or ester. The 1H NMR has a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's probably a CH2 adjacent to something electronegative. For a ketone, the carbonyl would be flanked by two CH2 groups, perhaps. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is an enol ether. Enol ethers have a structure like CH2=C-O. The CH2 group next to the oxygen would show up around 4.7 ppm. But the IR would show the C-O-C stretch, not a carbonyl. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, could it be a dienone? Like a conjugated diene with a ketone group.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a cyclic ketone. So maybe the two Brs are eliminated, forming a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's imagine the structure. Adamantane has a diamond-like structure. The 1 and 3 positions are across from each other on a bridge. So eliminating two HBr molecules would form a conjugated diene, but how would that lead to a carbonyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, and the structure becomes a bicyclic compound with a bridgehead double bond and a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double E2 elimination, where each Br is removed, forming a double bond, but that doesn't directly form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the base deprotonates, leading to an elimination that forms a carbonyl. Wait, but E2 is elimination, not oxidation. How would that happen?

Wait, another angle: perhaps the KOH isn't just a base but also a source of hydroxide, which could lead to substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would require two substitutions to form a diol, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Hmm. Maybe I should look up what happens when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH. Alternatively, think about similar reactions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming an allene. So the product would be 1,3-diene, but then the IR would show C=C peaks, not a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, but that's more for aromatic rings and uses metals like Na and NH3, so probably not here.

Wait, maybe it's a case of forming a diketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but that doesn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing an oxidation. But KOH is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless it's an elimination followed by some keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide with a carbonyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, the NMR has 4.79 (2H). Maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. So perhaps the product is an ether, like an epoxide. But then, where's the carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone with a neighboring CH2 group. For example, a structure like CH2-C(O)-R. The CH2 would be around 4.7 ppm. Let me think. If the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH eliminates two HBr's, perhaps forming a ketone in the process.

Wait, that's possible if each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. So perhaps each Br is at a position where elimination forms a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that requires esters. So I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring. Because cyclopropane rings can form via the elimination of two HX molecules. But cyclopropane would have C-H stretching in the NMR. Also, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the NMR data again. Product 1 has:

- 4.79 (2H) — probably a CH2 next to oxygen.
- 2.41-2.23 (10H) — these are likely the bridgehead CH2 groups in adamantane.
- 1.94 (2H) — perhaps another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps it's a glycol, but again, no carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone with an adjacent CH2-O group. Like (CH2)2CO. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by a ketone group, but that would require both positions to lose HBr and form two ketones, which is unlikely.

Hmm. Another approach: The IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. How is that formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond, but then further reaction forms a ketone. But how?

Oh! Wait a second. Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene, and then an oxidation of the diene to a diketone. But the question states that it's heated with KOH, which is a base, so maybe the oxidation isn't part of the first step.

Wait, but KOH is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent. So perhaps the first reaction just forms a diene, and the carbonyl comes from elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If it's similar to adamantane, which is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings, then the 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent bridgeheads. So when KOH is added, it may cause each Br to eliminate HBr, forming a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule, so maybe the structure rearranges.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a more stable double bond elsewhere, leading to a ring expansion.

Wait, but then how does a carbonyl form? Maybe the elimination doesn't form a double bond but forms a carbonyl. Wait, elimination typically forms alkenes, not carbonyl groups. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Another angle: perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a carbonyl. So, maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen group. But with KOH, that's more of a substitution, but how would that form a ketone.

Wait, wait. Perhaps the base causes the formation of a carbanion, which then oxidizes to a carbonyl. But oxidation usually requires an oxidizing agent, and KOH isn't typically an oxidizing agent.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the next steps. Once I figure out product 1, I can think about product 2.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, which is a common Lewis acid catalyst. What reactions does that facilitate? It's often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, or in the formation of esters from acids and alcohols. Alternatively, it can facilitate the formation of enol ethers from ketones.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then treatment with Al(i-Pr)3 might lead to some kind of acylation. But more likely, if product 1 has a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone, and Al isopropoxide could facilitate some kind of enolization or cyclization.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a diol. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, it could form an acetal or ketal. But the IR of product 1 has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Then, treatment with Al isopropoxide might induce ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienone, and Al isopropoxide helps in some kind of conjugate addition or rearrangement.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure. Let me imagine that product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed when product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide. What reaction could that be?

If product 1 is a cyclic ketone, perhaps product 2 is the result of a pinacol rearrangement, which involves the base-induced rearrangement of a diol to a ketone. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and Al isopropoxide is used to form an enol ether. Enol ethers have the structure R-O-C=O, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't see an aromatic ring.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, and Al isopropoxide helps in forming an acetal or ketal. Or maybe it's a Claisen condensation, but that usually involves esters.

Wait, another approach: perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, it could facilitate a Dieckmann cyclization, forming a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about product 2's structure before moving on.

After product 2 is formed, ozonolysis is done. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. So product 2 is a compound with a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms product 3.

So, if product 3 is formed from ozonolysis of product 2, then product 2 has at least one double bond.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone and product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone and product 2 is a compound with a double bond, perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which has a double bond. Then ozonolysis would break that double bond into carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, leading to two carbonyl groups upon ozonolysis.

Wait, but I'm still unclear on the steps, so perhaps I should try to figure out product 1 first.

Let me think again about product 1's NMR. The 4.79 (2H) is a singlet, so no splitting. That implies that the two protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons. So perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.

The 1.94 (2H) is a singlet as well. Wait, no, it's not stated as a singlet. The NMR description says 1.94(2H). But the splitting isn't specified, so it could be a triplet, a quartet, or a singlet.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 is a CH2 next to a carbonyl group. For example, in a ketone like (CH2)2CO. The CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would be around 2.2-2.5 ppm, but 4.79 is higher, so maybe it's a CH2-O group.

So maybe product 1 is an enol ether, which has a structure like CH2-CH-O. Enol ethers typically have the oxygen adjacent to a double bond, making the structure R-O-CH2-CH2-R. But then the IR would show the C=O, which isn't present in enol ethers. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal diol, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Let's say it's a six-membered ring with a ketone. Then, the adjacent CH2 groups would show up around 2.5 ppm.

But the NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which is higher than that. So perhaps it's a CH2-O group.

Another possibility: product 1 is an epoxide with a ketone group. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction forms an ester. Esters typically have carbonyl groups, so the IR matches. The NMR for an ester's CH2 adjacent to the oxygen would be around 4 ppm. For example, an ethyl ester's CH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But product 1's 4.79 is a bit higher, so maybe it's a methylene group with more deshielding, perhaps due to being next to two electronegative groups.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a cyclic ester (lactone), then the CH2 next to the ester oxygen would be around 4.7 ppm, depending on the ring size.

Wait, for example, in a five-membered lactone, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl would be around 4.5-5 ppm. So maybe product 1 is a lactone.

But how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a lactone upon treatment with KOH?

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide, which upon further reaction with KOH forms a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diepoxide, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen condensation. But that requires esters.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress on product 1. Let's think about product 2.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used to catalyze the formation of enol ethers from ketones, or to facilitate Friedel-Crafts reactions.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether. Enol ethers have a structure like R-O-CH2-CH2-R, with a double bond. So when product 2 is ozonized, the double bond would break, forming carbonyl groups.

So if product 2 is an enol ether, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, leading to two carbonyl groups.

But wait, ozonolysis of an enol ether would typically break the double bond, forming two carbonyl compounds. However, in the case of an enol ether, the structure is R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R' (not exactly, but something like that), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis is typically used on alkenes to form carbonyl compounds. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

If product 2 has a double bond, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But I'm not getting closer. Let's try to think about product 3's NMR.

In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen has a certain coupling pattern. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative group, like oxygen. In ozonolysis products, the carbonyl groups are at the ends, and the adjacent hydrogens would be more deshielded.

So if product 3 is a diketone, the hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. Each of these hydrogens would be next to a carbonyl and perhaps adjacent to other hydrogens, leading to coupling.

Let me imagine the structure. Suppose product 2 is an enol ether, like CH2=CH-O-R. Ozonolysis at -78°C would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-O-R, ozonolysis would break it into two formaldehyde groups or something similar, depending on the structure.

Wait, no, ozonolysis of a simple alkene like CH2=CH2 would give two formaldehyde molecules. But in a more complex structure, it would form more complex carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclic enol ether, like an oxetene or similar, ozonolysis would break it into a diketone or similar.

Wait, but let's think of product 2 as a simple alkene. Suppose product 2 is 1,3-diene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to think about the step 3: ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That's a standard ozonolysis procedure, which typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. The work-up with dimethyl sulfide would prevent the formation of ozonides and instead form the carbonyl compounds.

So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

Assuming product 2 has a single double bond, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, if product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyls.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

In product 3, the H adjacent to a carbonyl group (like a ketone) would be deshielded and appear upfield? Or downfield? Wait, deshielded means downfield, so higher ppm.

The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs. For example, a triplet would come from coupling with two equivalent Hs.

Let me imagine product 3 as a diketone, with a structure like (CH2)n(CO)2. The Hs on the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would be split based on their neighbors.

Wait, but if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, each H on the central CH2 would be split by two Hs from one side and perhaps another from the other.

Alternatively, imagine a structure like CH2(CO)CH2CH2(CO)CH2. That might not be correct, but let's think about the Hs.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2(CO)CH2CH2(CO)CH3. The Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the CO would each be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would couple with two Hs on one side and maybe one on the other.

Alternatively, considering a structure like CH2=C(O)R, but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, like CH2=CH2. Ozonolysis would break it into two formaldehyde molecules, each with a H. But formaldehyde's H is a singlet, so that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, product 2 is a substituted alkene. Let's say it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds, maybe two ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, like CH2=CH-O-R. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, if R is a CH2 group, it would break into two aldehyde groups.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the coupling patterns.

If the most deshielded H is adjacent to a carbonyl, it's likely part of a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. The splitting would depend on neighboring Hs.

Suppose the structure is CH2(CO)R. The Hs on the CH2 would be next to another CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 would be coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would result in a triplet.

Wait, but if the adjacent group is another CH2, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the options include triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two sets of neighboring Hs, leading to more splitting.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone with a structure like (CH2)2(CO)2. Then, the Hs on the CH2 groups adjacent to the CO would each have two neighboring Hs on the same carbon and perhaps two on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, no, in (CH2)2(CO)2, the structure would be more like CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a five-membered ring with two ketone groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a geminal diketone, which is unlikely as it's not very stable.

Wait, another angle: the coupling pattern for the most deshielded H is probably a triplet. So the answer might be A) triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think of a specific example.

If product 3 is a diketone, say, (CH2)2(CO)2, then the Hs on the CH2 groups next to the CO would each be adjacent to another CH2 group. Each H on the central CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would give a triplet.

Wait, let's imagine the structure as (CH2)3(CO)2. No, that might not be right.

Alternatively, consider a structure where the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a CO group, and this CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H on the central CH2 would be next to two Hs on one side and two on the other.

Wait, but that would lead to a quartet, as each H is coupled with two on each side, totaling four neighboring Hs, which would split into a quintet (pentet). Wait, no—each H would be next to two on the same carbon and perhaps two on the adjacent. Wait, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, maybe the H is part of a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2, which is next to a CH group. So the H would have two neighbors on one side and one on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets or something like that.

Hmm. Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH2 group next to a CH group that has two Hs, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but considering the options, a triplet seems plausible if the H is coupled with two neighboring Hs.

So, tentatively, I'll go with option A) triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning behind the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a double elimination reaction, forming a compound with a carbonyl group. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O). The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H) suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, likely forming an enol ether or a related structure. The 1.94 ppm (2H) and 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) signals correspond to CH₂ groups in the adamantane framework.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**:  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of product 2, which contains a double bond. The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is inferred to have a double bond based on the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. Thus, product 3 is likely a diketone or a compound with carbonyl groups at the sites of the original double bond.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl. The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring hydrogens. If the CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group, each hydrogen on the central CH₂ would couple with two hydrogens from the neighboring CH₂, resulting in a **triplet** splitting pattern.

Given the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
