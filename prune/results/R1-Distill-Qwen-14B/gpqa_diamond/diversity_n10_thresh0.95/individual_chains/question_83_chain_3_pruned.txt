Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I have to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

Alright, first, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. 

The problem gives me the initial volumes and concentrations. So, 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³? So I should calculate the new concentration after dilution.

Using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M. 

Then, we're titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. For the equivalence point, I need to find how much NaOH is required to neutralize all the acetic acid. 

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.05 M, V = 0.02 L. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. 

Because the reaction is 1:1 (each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH), the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence is also 0.001 mol. 

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. 

But wait, the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. That would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

Let me structure this. I need to find the pH at two points: 25% titration (which is before equivalence) and at equivalence. 

Starting with the 25% titration point. 

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. 

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. So after adding NaOH, moles of acetic acid will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. 

And moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 mol, since each mole of NaOH converts a mole of acetic acid to acetate. 

The total volume of the solution at this point is the initial diluted volume plus the added NaOH volume. So original 40 cm³ (0.04 L) plus 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) → 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). 

So the concentrations are: 
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M 
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M 

Now, this is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. 

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) 

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 

pKa ≈ 4.74 (since 1.8e-5 is about 4.74, and 1.85 is a bit higher, so maybe 4.74 or 4.73). 

Wait, let's compute it accurately. 

Ka = 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is about 0.267. So pKa = 4.733. So approximately 4.74. 

So pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) 

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. 

So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 4.26. 

So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26. 

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution. 

The moles of acetate ion at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ of NaOH added → 50 cm³ (0.05 L). 

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. 

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. Its hydrolysis in water can be represented as: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^- 

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. 

So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. 

To find the pH, I can set up the expression for Kb. Let's denote the concentration of OH^- as x. 

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] 

Assuming x is small, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02. 

So Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 ≈ 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M. 

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.29e-6 → pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486 → pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514. 

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, I could have considered the hydrolysis reaction and set up the equation. Let me see:

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's say it hydrolyzes to produce x M of OH^-.

The expression is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) 

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds. So x ≈ sqrt( Kb * 0.02 ) → sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.484 → pH ≈ 8.516, which rounds to 8.52.

Wait, but wait, sometimes for such weak bases, the approximation may not hold, but in this case, Kb is so small that the assumption is valid. So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52.

Looking back at the options:

Option A is 4.26; 8.52. So that seems to match. 

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for possible mistakes.

Wait, the initial dilution: 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 mL of water, the volume is 40 mL, so new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At 25% titration: 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 mL, 25% is 2.5 mL of NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol. Correct.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL. So concentrations are [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M, [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. 

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log (0.005882 / 0.017647) → pKa is 4.74. Log of 0.333 is -0.477. So 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. So 4.26. Correct.

At equivalence, all HA is converted to A^-. Moles A^- is 0.001 mol, volume is 50 mL → 0.05 L. Concn: 0.02 M. Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. So Kb = x² / 0.02 → x = sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) → sqrt(1.081e-11) → ~3.29e-6. pOH = 5.48 → pH = 8.52. So yes, option A's values are 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options again: option A is 4.26; 8.52
