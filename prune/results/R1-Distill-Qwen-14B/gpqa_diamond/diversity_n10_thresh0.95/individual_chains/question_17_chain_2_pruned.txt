Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So, the complex is Ca-EDTA, and we need to find [Ca²+].

Wait, the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ binds with EDTA^4- to form the complex. The general reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

I think the formation constant K is given by the expression K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Right. So, we can rearrange this to find [Ca²+], maybe.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote this as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Assuming that the concentration of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4- are much less than the concentration of the complex, which makes sense because K is large, like 5e10, so the reaction goes almost to completion, binding almost all the Ca²+ and EDTA into the complex.

So, the initial thought is that [Ca²+] is very small compared to the complex concentration. Therefore, [EDTA^4-] would also be very small, because most of it is tied up in the complex.

But wait, the problem is giving the concentration of the complex, which is the product. So, the [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and we're to find [Ca²+].

Let me write down the equation:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

We can rearrange this to:

[Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] / (K * [EDTA^4-])

Hmm, but we know that the total concentration of EDTA (free plus bound) is the sum of [EDTA^4-] and [CaEDTA^2-]. So, the total EDTA is [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-].

Wait, but wait a second. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, does that mean that the initial concentration of EDTA and Ca²+ was 0.02 M each, and they formed the complex? Or is the concentration of the complex itself 0.02 M?

I think the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

In that case, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are probably negligible because K is so large, so the complex formation is favored. So, almost all of the Ca²+ and EDTA are in the complex form.

Wait, but in this scenario, the complex is 0.02 M, so what's the [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-]?

Wait, let's think in terms of the problem: the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial conditions are that [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are to be determined.

But wait, how did the 0.02 M of the complex come about? Let's say that you have a solution where EDTA and Ca²+ were present, and they formed the complex. The initial concentrations would have been [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-], but given that K is very large, the reaction goes to completion, and the complex forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving a salt of the Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-? No, wait, the complex is a neutral molecule, I think. Wait, no—EDTA is a hexadentate ligand. The complex would be something like CaEDTA^2- because EDTA is usually in the 4- charge, so Ca²+ would neutralize two of them? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Let me think about the structure. Calcium is Ca²+, and EDTA is H4Y, which can lose four protons (under certain pH conditions) to become Y^4-. So the complex would be CaY^2- because Ca²+ + Y^4- → CaY^2-.

Wait, no: Ca²+ has a +2 charge, Y^4- is -4. So the complex would have a charge of -2. So, the complex is CaY^2-.

So, the formation reaction is: Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY^2-.

The formation constant K is given as 5e10. So K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

In this case, the solution has 0.02 M CaY^2-.

Now, the question is, what is [Ca²+]?

Assuming that the concentration of Y^4- is very low because most of it is tied up in the complex, and same for Ca²+.

But wait, the [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M.

Let me denote:

Let [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M.

Let [Ca²+] = x.

Let [Y^4-] = y.

So, according to the formation constant equation:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * y).

But what else do I know? The sum of [Y^4-] and [CaY^2-] would be the total EDTA concentration. Wait, but in this problem, the solution contains only the complex, so perhaps the total EDTA is the same as the concentration of the complex. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, so the total EDTA is 0.02 M, because each complex has one EDTA.

So, the total EDTA is [Y]_total = [Y^4-] + [CaY^2-] = y + 0.02.

But if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, then [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M and [Y^4-] is negligible compared to 0.02? Or maybe not, because if K is large, [Ca²+] and [Y^4-] are small.

Wait, but if K is very large, the reaction tends to completion, so almost all the Ca²+ and Y^4- are consumed into the complex. So, [Ca²+] and [Y^4-] would be very small, so [Y^4-] ≈ 0. But wait, that can't be because then the denominator would be zero, but the K is finite.

Wait, perhaps I can make the assumption that [Ca²+] and [Y^4-] are so small that [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

But I'm not sure. Let's proceed.

If I let [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M, then the K is 5e10.

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * y).

Which gives x * y = 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

But without another equation, I can't solve for x and y.

Wait, but the total EDTA is [Y_total] = [Y^4-] + [CaY^2-] = y + 0.02.

But if the solution is made from the complex, perhaps the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA were such that they formed the complex. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is that the solution was made by dissolving a compound like CaY·nH2O, which dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think again.

The solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The problem is to find [Ca²+].

But considering that the complex is in solution, and the formation constant is K = 5e10, which is a very large K, meaning the reaction goes almost to completion. So, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are very low.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the dissociation of the complex. Maybe the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the reverse reaction is: CaY^2- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-.

The K for the dissociation would be 1/K_form (since K_form is for the formation reaction; the dissociation K is Kd = 1/K_form).

So, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So, the dissociation reaction is:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-.

Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4-] / [CaY^2-] = 2e-11.

We have [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4-] are what we're looking for.

Assuming that x = [Ca²+] is equal to [Y^4-] because for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4- is produced.

So, let's assume x = [Ca²+] = [Y^4-].

Then,

Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So,

x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Thus, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So, 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So, [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So, that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the math. Kd is 2e-11. So, x^2 = (2e-11)(0.02) = 4e-13. So, x = sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-
