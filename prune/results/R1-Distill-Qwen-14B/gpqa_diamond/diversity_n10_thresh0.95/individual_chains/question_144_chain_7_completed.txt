--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, like they're made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonance means it's a short-lived particle, right? So, the question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X.

The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all different distances in meters, so I need to figure out the mean decay distance based on these values.

Wait, how do I relate these quantities to the decay distance? I think decay distance has to do with how far the particle travels before it decays. Since it's a resonance, it's probably a very short lifetime. 

I remember that the mean lifetime is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. Oh right! The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (which for a resonance is the width Γ) and the time uncertainty (the lifetime τ) is on the order of ħ (Planck's constant over 2π). So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I think the exact formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that sounds right. So once I find the lifetime, I can find the distance by multiplying by the velocity v of the particle.

Wait, but what's the velocity of the meson? Since it's produced at a certain energy, I need to find its velocity. The production energy is given as 8 GeV, but the meson's mass is 1.2 GeV. So this must be a relativistic situation.

The energy E is related to the rest mass by E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). Let me compute that. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... or 20/3. 

But wait, units? GeV, so I need to make sure everything is in consistent units. But since GeV, mass in GeV, and c^2 is (3e8 m/s)^2, but I think in natural units, c is 1. So maybe I can calculate everything in natural units and then convert to meters at the end.

Wait, but maybe I should just compute the velocity using relativistic formulas. The particle's energy is 8 GeV, mass is 1.2 GeV. So the momentum p can be found using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², but since we're working in units where c=1, it's E² = p² + m².

So p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV. 

Then, the momentum p is also equal to γ m v, where v is the velocity. So:

p = γ m v

We have γ = E / (m c²) = E/m (since c=1) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... 

So substituting:

7.91 ≈ (6.666) * (1.2) * v

Wait, wait. Wait, let me make this more accurate. Let's compute p numerically. 

E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV

p = sqrt(8^2 - (1.2)^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c. So p =7.91 GeV/c.

But since E = γ m c², and p = γ m v, so let's see:

p = γ m v

But γ = E/(m c²) = 8/(1.2) = 6.666...

So, p = (E/(m c²)) * m v = (E / c²) * v? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and gamma = E/(m c²), so:

p = (E/(m c²)) * m v = (E v) / c².

But E is in GeV, and c is in m/s. Maybe I should compute v in terms of E and m.

Alternatively, compute v as (p c²)/(E), because since p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c². So:

v = (p c²) / E

Hmm, let me check the units. p has units GeV/c, c^2 is m²/s², so (GeV/c * m²/s²) / (GeV) ) = (m²/(s² c m)) )? Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully.

Wait, let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. So in natural units, p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) ≈ 7.91 GeV. 

In natural units, E = gamma m, and p = gamma m v, so v = p / gamma.

So v = (7.91 GeV) / gamma.

Gamma is E/m = 8 / 1.2 ≈6.6667.

So v ≈ 7.91 / 6.6667 ≈ 1.1866 c?

Wait, that can't be right, because v can't exceed c. Oh wait, I must have messed up the natural units.

Wait, no, in natural units, c=1, so v is dimensionless and must be less than or equal to 1.

Wait, let me recalculate. E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV.

p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

Gamma is E / m = 8/1.2 ≈6.6667.

So v = p / (gamma m) * m ? No, perhaps another approach.

Wait, another formula: v = c sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

But in natural units, c=1, so v = sqrt(1 - m² / E²).

So v = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887 c.

Oh, that makes sense. So v ≈0.9887 c.

So the velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ.

Wait, but the units. ħ has units of GeV·s, because ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s ) / (0.32 GeV) ) ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's the mean lifetime.

So the mean decay distance is L = v * τ.

v is 0.9887 c, c ≈3e8 m/s.

So L ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating that: 

0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute that:

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e(8-24) = approx 6.102 * 1e-16 m.

Wait, 2.966 * 2.056875: let me compute that accurately.

2.966 * 2 is 5.932, 2.966 * 0.056875 = approx 0.1687. So total about 6.099 or ~6.1.

So 6.1e-16 meters. 

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are either about 5e-15 or 4e-15, or 5e-16, 4e-16.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in v. Let's recheck.

Wait, another approach: I can compute v in terms of beta, which is v/c.

Beta, β, is v/c = sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)).

So m² is (1.2)^2 = 1.44, E² is 64.

So 1 - (1.44/64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So v = β c.

So, tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, L = beta c tau.

So beta c tau = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.105e-16 m.

Wait, but none of the options are close to this. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let's re-express the calculation using precise numbers.

Compute ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (1.44/64)) = sqrt(0.9775) = approx 0.9887.

So L = beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.105e-16 m.

Wait, but that's 6.1e-16 m, but none of the options are close. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 5.0223 *1e-16 m
B) 4.0655 *1e-15 m
C) 5.0223 *1e-15 m
D)4.0655 *1e-16 m

Hmm, none are 6e-16. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the conversion of units. Let me double-check the calculation of beta.

E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

E² =64, m²=1.44.

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (m² / E²)) = sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) = sqrt(1- 0.0225)= sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps ħ is in different units. Wait, ħ is about 6.582 × 10^(-25) GeV·s. Correct.

So, tau= ħ/Γ= 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Then, L= beta c tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Multiply by beta: 0.9887 *6.170625e-16 ≈ 6.105e-16 m.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, maybe I should not approximate beta. Let's compute beta more accurately.

Compute 1.44 /64 =0.0225.

1-0.0225=0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775)= let me compute that more accurately.

I know that sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, sqrt(0.9801)=0.99, sqrt(0.9775)=?

Let me compute 0.9887^2 = (0.9887)^2.

0.98 * 0.98 =0.9604.

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Let me compute 0.9887 * 0.9887.

= (0.98 +0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98 *0.0087 + 0.0087^2.

= 0.9604 + 0.017208 + 0.00007569.

= 0.9604 + 0.017208= 0.977608 + 0.00007569= 0.97768369.

Wait, but 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.97768. But we're looking for sqrt(0.9775), which is a tiny bit less than 0.9887.

Wait, maybe 0.9887 is accurate enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly different beta, but I think it's negligible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mean decay length formula. Let me reevaluate.

The decay length L is given by L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Wait, wait, maybe I forgot the gamma factor? No, I think the lifetime is tau = ħ / Γ, and then the distance is L = beta c tau.

Wait, but wait, another thought: For a particle moving relativistically, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. But gamma is E/(m c²) in natural units. So, proper lifetime is tau0 = tau_rest = hbar/(Gamma). Wait, no, I think tau is the proper lifetime when the particle is at rest, but for a moving particle, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So in that case, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau0.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In particle physics, the width Γ is related to the lifetime tau by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau is ħ / Γ.

But when the particle is moving, the lab frame lifetime is longer by the Lorentz factor gamma. So the mean lifetime in the lab is gamma * tau.

Ah! So I think I made a mistake earlier. I calculated tau as the proper lifetime, but in reality, the lab frame lifetime is gamma multiplied by that.

So, the previous calculation of tau is actually the proper lifetime, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

So that changes the calculation.

So, let's recompute:

tau_lab = gamma * tau.

Gamma is E/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 s.

So tau_lab = 6.666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, the decay length L = beta c tau_lab.

So, beta is sqrt(1 - (m²/E²))= ~0.9887.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, L= 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 4.11375e-15 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 4.11375e-15 * 0.9887 ≈4.073e-15 m.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.02e-15. Hmm, 4.07e-15 is closer to option B.

But let me compute more precisely.

Compute 3e8 *1.37125e-23 = 3e8 is 3 *1e8, 1.37125e-23 is 1.37125 *1e-23.

Multiply: 3 *1.37125 =4.11375, and 1e8 *1e-23=1e-15.

So 4.11375e-15 m.

Multiply by beta: 0.9887 *4.11375e-15 = ?

Compute 4.11375 * 0.9887. 

4 * 0.9887 = 3.9548.

0.11375 *0.9887 ≈0.1123.

So total approximately 3.9548 +0.1123=4.0671.

So 4.0671e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer would be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by analyzing the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The decay distance is related to the particle's velocity \( v \) and its lifetime \( \tau \), with \( \tau \) determined by the uncertainty principle as \( \tau = \hbar / \Gamma \). The velocity \( v \) is calculated using relativistic kinematics.

### Step 1: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic formula:
\[
v = \beta c = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}}
\]
Substituting \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2} = \frac{1.44}{64} = 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2} = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775
\]
\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887, \quad v = 0.9887c
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The lab-frame lifetime is extended by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), where:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]
Thus:
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]
Substituting \( v = 0.9887c \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23}
\]
First, calculate \( 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \):
\[
3 \times 1.37125 = 4.11375, \quad 10^8 \cdot 10^{-23} = 10^{-15}, \quad 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} = 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]
Now multiply by \( 0.9887 \):
\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \approx 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

**Answer: B**
