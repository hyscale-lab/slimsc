Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me see what I remember and how to apply it to this question.

Alright, the problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, I think this means |alpha> is a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states for the z-projection. But wait, because it's proportional, I probably need to normalize it first. Oh right, because the state vector has to have a norm of 1.

So first, I should write out |alpha> as a normalized state. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me find the normalization factor. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So, I need to compute the inner product of this with itself.

Let me compute the squared magnitude of each coefficient. The coefficient of |up> is (1+i), so the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) because when you take the conjugate, you reverse the sign of the imaginary part. So (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient for |down> is (2 -i), so its magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. Wait, no, because when you take (2 -i)*(2 +i) = 4 +2i -2i -i^2 =4 +0 +1=5. So the total inner product is 2 + 5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next part of the question: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix Aij. The matrix A has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, but wait, what's the size of this matrix? Since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of S_z, which is a 2x2 system, the operator must be a 2x2 matrix.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the elements would be A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1), A_12 = ħ/2, A_21 = ħ/2, and A_22 =0. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A is (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Wait, but the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the operator A is proportional to σ_x, so its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. Therefore, the eigenstates of operator A are the spin-up and spin-down states in the x-direction.

So the question is, when we measure the system in the eigenbasis of A (i.e., |+x> and |-x>), what are the probabilities of getting each eigenvalue, and what's the average value of A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis. So to find the probabilities of measuring in the x-basis, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, or find the overlap between |alpha> and each of the x-eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation values and the probabilities directly using the matrix representation.

Alternatively, since the operator is A = (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues will be ±ħ/2. So when we measure A, we'll get either +ħ/2 or -ħ/2, with probabilities equal to the square of the amplitudes of |+x> and |-x> in the state |alpha>.

But how do I find those amplitudes?

Wait, perhaps I can write |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>. I remember that |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me confirm that. Because σ_x has eigenstates that are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of |up> and |down>.

So |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So any state can be expressed in terms of these, and the coefficients will give the amplitudes for each eigenstate.

So, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by sqrt(7). Let's write it as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

We can express this in the x-basis by projecting onto |+x> and |-x>.

The amplitude for |+x> is < +x | alpha >.

Compute < +x | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2)] [ < up | + < down | ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Which is [1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)))] [ (1+i) (1) + (2 -i)(1) ) ]

Wait, because < up | up > =1, < down | down >=1, and the cross terms would be zero because < up | down > =0.

So compute the inner product:

(1+i) * 1/sqrt(2) *1/sqrt(7) + (2 -i) *1/sqrt(2) *1/sqrt(7)
= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

Simplify numerator: 1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So the amplitude is 3 / (sqrt(2 *7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, the amplitude for |-x> is < -x | alpha >.

Which is [1/sqrt(2)] [ < up | - < down | ] multiplied by |alpha>.

So:

[1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))] [ (1+i)(1) - (2 -i)(1) ]

Compute numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So the amplitude is ( -1 + 2i ) / (sqrt(14)).

Now, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these amplitudes.

For |+x>:

|3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429, which is approximately 0.643, but looking at the options, option A has 0.64, which is about that. But let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., which is about 0.643. So it's approximately 0.64, which matches option A's first value.

But wait, what's the other probability? Since probabilities sum to 1, the other one would be 5/14 ≈ 0.357. But looking at the options, option A has 0.36, which is close. So maybe that's the case.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the amplitudes. Let me check the calculation for < -x | alpha >.

Amplitude is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) = (1 +i -2 +i)/sqrt(14) )= (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357, which is about 0.36 as in option A.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option A says 0.64 and 0.36, so that seems correct.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, the average value would be (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in |alpha>.

The expectation value of σ_x is the sum over the eigenstates of their probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. So, for |+x>, the eigenvalue is +1, and the probability is 9/14. For |-x>, the eigenvalue is -1, and probability 5/14. So the expectation value of σ_x is (9/14)(1) + (5/14)(-1) ) = (9 -5)/14 =4/14= 2/7.

So the average value of A is (ħ/2)(2/7) ) = ħ/(7).

Wait, wait, no: (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/(7). So the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average is ħ/7. So that matches.

But wait, let me compute it another way to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Given A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So A = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]].

Expressed in the z-basis, |up> is [1;0], |down> is [0;1].

So |alpha> is the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Compute alpha^† A alpha.

So let's compute it step by step.

A matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ ħ/2, 0 ].

So,

alpha^† is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply by A: the matrix multiplication would be alpha^† * A.

So:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) * (0) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2) → for the first element.

Second element is (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *0 → (1+i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)).

Then, multiply by alpha:

[ ( (2 -i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ), ( (1+i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ] multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So the product is:

(2 -i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + (1+i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

Compute each term:

First term: (2 -i)(1+i) * ħ/(2 *7) )= [ (2)(1) + 2i -i(1) -i^2 ] * ħ/(14)

Simplify numerator: 2 +i +1 (since -i^2 =1) → 3 +i.

So first term: (3 + i) ħ/(14)

Second term: (1+i)(2 -i) * ħ/(2 *7) ) → [ 2 -i + 2i -i^2 ] → [2 + i +1 ] →3 +i.

So second term: (3 +i) ħ/(14)

Add them together:

(3 +i +3 +i) ħ/(14) )= (6 +2i) ħ/(14) )= 2(3 +i) ħ/(14) )= (3 +i) ħ/(7).

Wait, that's getting me a complex number, which doesn't make sense for the expectation value. Because the expectation value of an observable should be real.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication. Let me re-calculate <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2) [[0,1], [1,0]] ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

First, compute A |alpha>:

A |alpha> = (ħ/2) [ [0,1;1,0] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] ]

Which is (ħ/2) [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ].

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> = (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2) )

Wait, because when you multiply [a b] * [c d]^T, it's a*c + b*d.

Wait, more precisely:

The result after A|alpha> is (ħ/2) [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

So the inner product is:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ (2-i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Which is (ħ/2) [ (1-i)(2 -i)/(7) + (2 +i)(1 +i)/(7) ) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 → 2 -i -2i -1 → (2-1) + (-3i) → 1-3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2 →2 +3i -1 → (2-1) +3i →1+3i.

So sum is (1-3i) + (1+3i) )= 2.

So <alpha|A|alpha> = (ħ/2) * (2)/(7) )= (2 ħ) / (14) → ħ/7.

Ah, that's real, and matches the earlier result. So the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A is "0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7", which matches exactly.

So the correct answer must be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization condition requires \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). Calculating the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

- For \( (1+i) \), the magnitude squared is \( (1+i)(1-i) = 2 \).
- For \( (2-i) \), the magnitude squared is \( (2-i)(2+i) = 5 \).

The total norm is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) is given with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these states. The amplitudes are:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these amplitudes:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as \( \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in \( |\alpha\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = P(+x)(+1) + P(-x)(-1) = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the average value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

From the options, the probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \) (approximations of \( 9/14 \) and \( 5/14 \)) and the average value \( \hbar/7 \) match option A.
