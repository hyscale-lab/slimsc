Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and the matrix S has specific entries. The first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and choose the correct statement from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are related to its trace and determinant. Wait, but first, let me write down what the matrix S looks like. So S is a 2x2 matrix:

Row 1: 0   -i
Row 2: i    0

Wait, that's the Y Pauli matrix. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So σy is exactly S here. And the Pauli matrices usually have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2, but here c is h/(4π). Hmm, but wait, Planck's constant h is often used, and sometimes ħ is used, which is h/(2π). So ħ = h/(2π). Oh right, because ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

So Ay is c times S. Let me compute c first. c is h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) * (1/2) )= ħ * (1/2). So c = ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Let me compute c: c = h/(4π). So if ħ is h/(2π), then c = (ħ)/(2). Because h/(4π) = [h/(2π)] / 2 = ħ/2. So c is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. Now, the eigenvalues of σy are ±i, wait no, wait. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, right? σy is Hermitian. Wait, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. But wait, σy is:

0  -i
i   0

Wait, is that correct? Because the standard σy is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Wait, but wait, when I compute σy, it's (σy)†. Let me check. For σy, the (1,2) entry is -i, and (2,1) is i. So yes, the matrix S is σy. So σy is Hermitian because the conjugate transpose is equal to itself. Wait, because σy† = [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ] which is the same as σy because the elements are -i and i, which are conjugates. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute σy†.

σy is:
0   -i
i    0

The conjugate transpose (dagger) would swap the off-diagonal terms and take their complex conjugates. So (σy)† is:
0      i
- i     0

Which is not the same as σy. Hmm, so wait, does that mean σy is not Hermitian? Because if S is σy, then S† is not equal to S. Wait, that can't be right. Because I thought Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the definition of S. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says S is a 2x2 matrix whose first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So that's the same as σy. Then why isn't σy Hermitian? Because for Hermitian matrices, S† = S. Let me compute σy†. The conjugate transpose of σy would be:

0   i
- i 0

Which is not the same as σy. Wait, so that would mean that σy is anti-Hermitian, but that can't be correct. Wait, no, maybe I've made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps it's defined differently. Oh wait, perhaps S is actually iσy? Because then S would be Hermitian. Let me think. Let me compute (iσy):

iσy would be:

i*0   i*(-i)
i*i   i*0

Which is:

0   -(i^2) = -( -1 ) = 1
i^2  0 → (-1) 0 → [ [0, 1], [-1, 0] ]

Wait, that's the standard representation of σy. Hmm, maybe I have to reconsider. Alternatively, perhaps the given matrix S is actually σy, but in a different basis. Or perhaps the given S is (σy/ i). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the given matrix S and compute its eigenvalues regardless of its properties. So the problem is to find the eigenvalues of Ay = c S, where c = h/(4π) = ħ/2.

So Ay is (ħ/2) times S. Let me compute the matrix Ay.

S is:
[0   -i]
[i    0]

So Ay is:

(ħ/2)*0   (ħ/2)*(-i)
(ħ/2)*i    (ħ/2)*0

Which is:

[0, -(iħ/2)]
[iħ/2, 0]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0          -(iħ/2) ]
[ iħ/2        0      ]

Wait, that's the matrix.

Now, the eigenvalues of Ay are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a       -(iħ/2) ]
[ iħ/2     -a      ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (iħ/2)(iħ/2) ) ] = a² - (i^2 (ħ^2)/4 )

Since i^2 is -1, this becomes a² - ( (-1) ħ²/4 ) = a² + (ħ²/4) = 0.

So the equation is a² + (ħ²/4) ) = 0 → a² = - ħ² /4 → a = ± i ħ/2.

Wait, but that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary: ± iħ/2. But that's unexpected because for an angular momentum component, the eigenvalues are real. Oh wait, but wait, the angular momentum operator is J, and its components are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that Ay is the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So it's part of the angular momentum, which is a Hermitian operator, so the eigenvalues should be real. But according to this calculation, the eigenvalues are imaginary. That suggests I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me double-check. The problem says that Ay = c S, where c is h/(4π), and S is the given matrix. Let me compute c again. c is h/(4π). So if ħ is h/(2π), then c = ħ/2.

So, Ay = (ħ/2) * S. And S is:

[0    -i]
[i    0 ]

Wait, but that's the same as (σy) multiplied by i? Because σy is:

[0    -i]
[i    0 ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, σy is usually defined as:

[0   -i]
[i    0 ]

So S is σy. So then Ay is (ħ/2) σy.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operators Jx, Jy, Jz are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. This suggests that σy must be Hermitian, but according to the matrix given, S is σy, which when I checked earlier seems not to be Hermitian.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining whether S is Hermitian. Let me compute S†.

S is:

Row 1: 0   -i
Row 2: i    0

So S† is the conjugate transpose. So the (1,2) element becomes (2,1) element's conjugate. So (2,1) element is i, so its conjugate is -i. So S† is:

Row 1: 0      i
Row 2: -i     0

Which is not equal to S. So S is not Hermitian. That's a problem because if Ay is supposed to be a component of angular momentum, it should be Hermitian. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup or in my understanding.

Wait a second, perhaps the given matrix S is actually (σy/ i ), which would make it Hermitian. Let me see. Let me compute σy/ i:

σy is:

0   -i
i   0

Divided by i would be:

(0)/(i)   (-i)/(i) → 0   (-i^2) → 0   (1) since i^2=-1.

i/(i) → 1, and 0/(i)=0. So σy/i would be:

0   1
1   0

Which is the Pauli matrix σx. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I should have multiplied by i instead of divided. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps S is actually iσy.

Wait, let's see: iσy would be:

i * [0   -i]
     [i    0 ]

Which gives:

0   -i^2 → 0   -(-1) → 0   1

i^2 → -1, so the (2,1) element becomes i^2 → -1.

So iσy would be:

[0    1]
[-1    0]

Which is the Pauli σx matrix. Hmm, so perhaps S is σy, which isn't Hermitian, but that's confusing because the angular momentum operator should be Hermitian.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different convention. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix S is actually (σy), but in a different representation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, and the S matrix is Hermitian. Let me check again.

Wait, S is given as:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So S† is:

Row 1: 0, i
Row 2: -i, 0

Which is not the same as S. So S is not Hermitian. Therefore, Ay as defined would not be Hermitian, which contradicts with the expectation because an angular momentum component should be Hermitian and have real eigenvalues.

Wait, but I'm probably missing something here. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix S is different. Oh wait, no, the problem says S is a 2x2 matrix with the given rows. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed despite this and compute the eigenvalues as I did earlier, which were ± i ħ/2. But that would imply that the eigenvalues are imaginary, which can't be right for a Hermitian operator. Oh, but in this case, perhaps the operator isn't Hermitian, which contradicts the physical meaning. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe I should check the problem statement again. Oh, wait, the problem says that the operator is Ay = c·S, with c = h/(4π), and S is the given matrix. So perhaps the operator isn't Hermitian. But that would imply that the problem is ill-posed, which isn't likely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the eigenvalues.

Wait, let's recompute the characteristic equation. The matrix Ay is:

[ 0          -(iħ/2) ]
[ iħ/2        0      ]

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a       -(iħ/2) ]
[ iħ/2     -a      ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (iħ/2)(iħ/2) ) ] = a² - (i^2)(ħ^2/4) → a² - (-1)(ħ²/4) → a² + (ħ²/4) = 0 → a² = - ħ²/4 → a = ± i ħ/2.

So that's correct. So the eigenvalues are imaginary. But this can't be right because the angular momentum operator should have real eigenvalues. So this suggests that perhaps the matrix S isn't correct, or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the given matrix S is actually (i σy). Let me try that.

If S were i σy, then S would be:

i * [0   -i] → [0, -i^2 ] → [0, 1]
    [i    0] → [i^2, 0 ] → [-1, 0]

So S would be:

0    1
-1    0

Which is the Pauli σx matrix. Then Ay would be (ħ/2) * σx, which is Hermitian. Then the eigenvalues would be ± (ħ/2).

But the problem states that S is given as:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Which is σy, not iσy. So I'm confused. Maybe the problem is correct, and I'm just proceeding.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the operator is for spin-1/2 particles, and the intrinsic angular momentum can have eigenvalues in units of ħ/2. So for Jy, the eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2, which are real.

But according to my earlier calculation, the eigenvalues of Ay would be ± i ħ/2, which are imaginary. So that would imply that I've made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix. Let me re-express Ay.

Wait, Ay is c·S, and S is as given. Let me recompute the matrix:

c = h/(4π) = ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So each element:

(0) → 0
(-i) → -i*(ħ/2)
i → i*(ħ/2)
0 → 0.

So the matrix is:

[0          -i*(ħ/2)]
[i*(ħ/2)    0      ]

Wait, when I do that, the matrix is:

0    -iħ/2
iħ/2    0

So the matrix is correct.

Wait, but let's consider the determinant of (Ay - a I) again. It's ( -a )^2 - [ (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) ) ].

Compute the product: (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) = (-i)(i) (ħ^2/4) ) = ( (-i^2) ) (ħ^2/4) ) → ( -(-1) ) (ħ^2/4) = (1)(ħ^2/4) → ħ^2/4.

So the equation becomes a² - (ħ^2/4) = 0 → a² = ħ²/4 → a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, wait a second! I think I made a mistake earlier. Earlier, I thought the product was (iħ/2)(iħ/2) but it's actually (-iħ/2)(iħ/2). Let me compute that correctly.

(-iħ/2) * (iħ/2) = (-i * i) * (ħ^2/4) ) = (-i²) * (ħ^2/4) → since i² = -1 → (-(-1)) = 1. So it's (1) * (ħ²/4) → ħ²/4.

So the determinant is a² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but that's different from what I got earlier. Earlier I thought it was a² + (ħ²/4) = 0, which would give imaginary eigenvalues. But now, I'm getting a² - (ħ²/4)=0, which gives real eigenvalues, which makes sense for a Hermitian operator. So what's the correct approach here?

Wait, I think I confused myself earlier. Let me re-do the calculation properly.

The matrix is:

[0          -iħ/2]
[iħ/2        0   ]

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a         -iħ/2 ]
[ iħ/2      -a     ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) )

= a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (ħ²/4) ) ]

Compute (-i)(i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1.

So the determinant is a² - (1 * ħ²/4) = a² - ħ²/4 = 0 → a² = ħ²/4 → a = ± ħ/2.

Aha! So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, which are real. That makes sense because we're dealing with a Hermitian operator.

So the eigenvalues are a = ± ħ/2 → which is ± (h/(4π)) * 2 → because ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 = (h/(2π))/2 = h/(4π), which is the same as c. Wait, c is h/(4π), so ħ/2 is c.

Wait, but wait, no: c is h/(4π) → so ħ/2 is h/(4π), so c = ħ/2.

So eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 → which is ± c.

But looking at the options, let's check.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh or ∓2πh, real parts ±h/(4π) or ∓h/(4π). That doesn't match, because the eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts are zero.

Option B: The imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't match because the eigenvalues are real. So their imaginary parts should be zero.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Wait, well, A² is the square of angular momentum, which commutes with all components. So for spin-1/2, A² would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2 * 3 (since for spin s, A² = s(s+1) ħ², but for spin 1/2, s=1/2 → 3/4 ħ².

Wait, but if Ay and A² are commuting operators, their eigenfunctions can be simultaneous eigenfunctions. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2, which would be correct. But can they also be eigenfunctions of Az? No, because Ay and Az don't commute. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C says eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, perhaps this refers to the eigenfunctions forming a basis. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors would form a basis for C². So option D could be correct. But wait, the statement is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I'm not entirely sure about this.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az. That seems correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az does not commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are not the same.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since Ay is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so this is correct as well.

Wait, but let's think about this. Whether the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator depends on whether the operator is diagonal in that basis. Well, if Ay has two eigenfunctions, they form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So option D says that the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That seems correct because any matrix can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis, so the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator. So option D is correct.

Wait, but option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions can indeed be the same. So option C is correct.

Wait, but let's think about the options. The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

So let me recheck the options.

Looking at the options again:

A) Imaginary parts are ±2πh or ∓ etc. No, eigenvalues are real.

B) Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. No, eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) * 2? Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is h/(4π) * (2π/h) * h/(4π) )? Wait, no, because ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π))?

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute:

ħ = h/(2π). So ħ/2 = h/(4π), which is the value of c. So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2 = ± c. So a = ± c = ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, so the eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)), which is the same as ± c.

So looking at the options:

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh or ∓2πh, but the real parts are ±c or ∓c. So for a, real part would be ±c, which is h/(4π). So option A's real parts match, but the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is much larger. Then, but the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary part is zero. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Again, our eigenvalues are real, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Correct, because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions, but Az doesn't commute, so they don't share.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis. So yes, D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So options C and D are possibilities.

Let me recheck the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so they can have the same eigenfunctions. But Az does not commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix operator's eigenvectors form a basis, so this is correct.

So now, both C and D could be correct statements. But let's look again at the problem statement.

The question says, during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. So this is correct because A² commutes with Ay.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the correct statement. Now, both C and D could be correct. Let me check the other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions can't be simultaneously eigenfunctions of Az, so option C is correct.

Looking back at the options, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps all correct statements are considered.

Wait, but let me read the options again.

Option C) The eigenfunctions of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So both C and D seem correct. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of an operator form a basis for the space on which the operator acts. So, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if distinct) will form a basis. So D is correct.

But in the problem's options, only one option is correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because option D talks about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of the operator, but the operator is represented in the standard basis. Hmm, perhaps not necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let's think about the statements again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. This is correct, because A² and Ay commute, so they share eigenfunctions. However, Az and Ay do not commute, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Since the operator is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space (if they are distinct), which they are in this case. So D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps in this scenario, the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis, so D is correct.

So the options are:

A) Incorrect (eigenvalues are real)
B) Incorrect (eigenvalues are real)
C) Correct
D) Correct

But the options can't both be correct. Let me re-examine the problem.

Looking back, I think the correct answer is option C. Because the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So, when you compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you can find that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but another point: the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2, which is ± c. So for the options, looking at option B:

B) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are ±1/2 or ∓1/2, and the real parts are ±1 or ∓1.

But our eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero, so option B is incorrect.

So, considering all that, the correct statements are C and D.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the eigenvectors as well to see if any other options make sense.

So, for a = +ħ/2, the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[-ħ/2   -iħ/2 ]
[ iħ/2   -ħ/2 ]

We can write this as:

Row 1: (-ħ/2) x - (i ħ/2) y = 0
Row 2: (i ħ/2) x - (ħ/2) y = 0

From row 1: (-ħ/2) x - (i ħ/2) y = 0 → (-x - i y) = 0 → x = -i y.

So the eigenvectors are of the form y * (-i, 1). Let me choose y=1 for simplicity. Then the eigenvector is (-i, 1).

Similarly, for a = -ħ/2, the matrix becomes:

[ ħ/2   -i ħ/2 ]
[ i ħ/2   ħ/2 ]

Which gives:

Row 1: (ħ/2) x - (i ħ/2) y = 0 → x - i y = 0 → x = i y.

So the eigenvector is (i, 1).

So, the eigenvectors are [-i, 1] and [i, 1], which are orthogonal.

So, these eigenfunctions form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So option D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

So, both options C and D seem correct, but the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So, both statements are correct. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², which is a correct statement, and D is also correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But in the problem, which option is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not the same as the basis functions of the operator. The basis functions are the standard basis vectors, but the eigenfunctions can form a different basis. So, option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator, which is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space on which Ay acts.

But I'm not entirely certain. Perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: looking for which option is correct based on the information.

Since the eigenvalues are real (as we found), option A and B are incorrect. So the correct options are either C or D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct because A² and Ay commute. So their eigenfunctions are the same.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, this is correct.

So, both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps only option C is correct. Because option D's statement is a bit ambiguous. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator matrix. But the operator is represented in the standard basis, so the eigenfunctions may not be the standard basis vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another point: the statement in option D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." The wording is a bit unclear. Are the basis functions referring to the eigenbasis or the standard basis? The eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator in the sense that they form a basis, but they may not be the standard basis.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you find the eigenfunctions of an operator, they form a basis for the space. So option D is correct.

So, perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options are designed so that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because in the context of angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of Ay (eigenstates of Jy) are not eigenstates of Jz, which is what option C says. So, option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it correctly states that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the given \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the operator \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 
   0 & -i \\ 
   i & 0 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The eigenvalues \( a \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). The matrix \( A_y - aI \) is:
   \[
   A_y - aI = \begin{bmatrix} 
   -a & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\ 
   \frac{i h}{4\pi} & -a 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   The determinant is:
   \[
   (-a)^2 - \left(-\frac{i h}{4\pi}\right)\left(\frac{i h}{4\pi}\right) = a^2 - \left(-\frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}\right).
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   a^2 + \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0 \implies a^2 = -\frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

3. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), solving \( (A_y - aI)\psi = 0 \) yields eigenvectors proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). For \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvectors are proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). These eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis for the \( 2 \)-dimensional space.

4. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero, not \( \pm 2\pi h \).
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (since \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \)), but they cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (since \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute).
   - **Option D:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the \( 2 \)-dimensional space, as they are linearly independent and span the space.

5. **Final Decision:**
   Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, **Option C** is the most relevant, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), which is directly tied to the eigenvalue problem.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option C**.
