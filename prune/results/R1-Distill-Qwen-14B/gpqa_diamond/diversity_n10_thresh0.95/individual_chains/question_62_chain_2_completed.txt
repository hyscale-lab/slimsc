--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. And the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. I need to choose the correct sequence of reagents from the given options A, B, C, D.

Hmm, let's break down the target molecule. The structure seems to have a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane, and there's also a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). So the target molecule is a bicyclic compound with an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached via a methylene bridge to another cyclohexane ring.

Wait, starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to an ethynyl group, which is like a triple bond. So maybe the first step is to do some kind of alkyne chemistry.

Looking at the options, all of them have NaNH2 and some alkylating agent first. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions, like forming enolates or in the formation of alkali metal acetylides. Oh, right, ethynylcyclohexane has acidic protons because the sp-hybridized carbon is electron-deficient. So NaNH2 would deprotonate the ethynyl group to form an acetylide.

The next step in all options is some kind of alkylation or hydrogenation. Let's see what each option does.

Option A: After NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd, then Ba(OH)2, and H2SO4 with HgSO4 and H2O. Hmm, methyl chloride would methylate the acetylide. So the acetylide (from ethynylcyclohexane) would react with methyl chloride to form a new alkyne, maybe (cyclohexyl)propane? Wait, no. Let me think: the acetylide is CH2-C≡C-Cyclohexane. Adding methyl chloride would give CH2-C≡C-Cyclohexane with a methyl group added? Wait, no, the acetylide would have a negative charge on the sp carbon. So the acetylide is [C≡C-]− attached to cyclohexane. Adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide to form CH2Cl-C≡C-Cyclohexane? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, methyl chloride would methylate the acetylide to form a longer alkyne. So starting from cyclohexylacetylene (ethynylcyclohexane), deprotonation forms the acetylide. Then adding methyl chloride would give cyclohexylpropyne (maybe), like CH2-C≡C-CH2-Cyclohexane? Or perhaps it's the other way, adding a methyl group to the triple bond. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to a triple bond, like CH2-C≡CH group? Wait, no, ethynyl is the group where the triple bond is attached directly. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So when deprotonated with NaNH2, the acetylide would be cyclohexylacetylide: [C≡C-]− attached to cyclohexane.

Then, when you add methyl chloride, which is an alkylating agent, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, giving CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane. So the triple bond is now between two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let's see: the acetylide is [C≡C-]−. Adding CH3Cl would give CH3-C≡C−, but attached to cyclohexane. So the molecule would become CH2-C≡C-CH2-Cyclohexane? Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps after deprotonation and alkylation, you get a longer alkyne.

But then, after that, in option A, the next reagents are H2 with Pd. That's hydrogenation, which would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, but with possible addition of hydrogen. So if the alkyne is CH3-C≡C-CH2-Cyclohexane, hydrogenation would give CH2CH2-CH2-Cyclohexane, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no—hydrogenation of a triple bond typically gives a single bond, so CH2CH2 would become CH2CH2, but perhaps more accurately, it would become an alkane.

Wait, but wait, after the first step, the alkyne is now substituted. Let me think: the initial structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-H. Deprotonate to get cyclohexane-C≡C⁻. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would add a methyl group, so it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's propyne. So the product after step 1 is 1-propyne attached to cyclohexane, so cyclohexyl-propyne?

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is forming a methyl group. So after step 1, you have CH2-C≡C-CH2-Cyclohexane? Or CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane?

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the next step. Let's say after step 1, you have a longer alkyne, then step 2 is hydrogenation. So in option A, after step 1 (methyl chloride), step 2 is H2/Pd, which is catalytic hydrogenation. That would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, so the alkyne becomes an alkane. So cyclohexyl-propane? Or perhaps cyclohexyl-ethane? Wait, I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial alkyne is converted into a gem-dimethyl group. Wait, no, methyl chloride is a methylating agent, so adding a methyl group to the acetylide. So the product after step 1 would be CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, and the molecule becomes CH2CH2-Cyclohexane? No, that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of an alkyne typically adds two hydrogens. So CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane would become CH3-CH2-Cyclohexane? Wait, no, that would be a single bond. So the structure would be CH2CH2-CH2-Cyclohexane? No, that can't be right. Maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure after step 1 is cyclohexane with a propargyl group, like CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the triple bond, making it a single bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, and the molecule would become CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem right, because that would be a propane chain. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans or cis double bond, but I think that would require a different catalyst, like Lindlar's for cis, or something else for trans. Pd is usually used for full hydrogenation to a single bond. So maybe that's what's happening.

But perhaps I should move on to the next steps. After step 2 in option A, step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions, for example, in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or in the formation of epoxides. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is also used in the Birch reduction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 in aqueous conditions could be a way to induce elimination. Or perhaps it's a way to dehydrate an alcohol.

Wait, but in option A, the third reagent is Ba(OH)2, then the fourth is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used in the oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, or in the Jones oxidation. So maybe the steps are forming some alcohol, then oxidizing it.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, we have a diol or something else. Hmm.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the target molecule again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group connected to another cyclohexane ring. And on the same carbon, perhaps, there's an aldehyde group. Wait, no, the name is a bit confusing. Let me write it out.

The main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde: a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2-CHO group attached. Wait, no—the 'carbaldehyde' would be a -CHO group attached directly to the cyclohexane, so cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is benzaldehyde but with a cyclohexane ring instead of benzene. So cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is (cyclohexyl)methanal.

But in the target, it's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So on the cyclohexane ring, there's a substituent at position 1 (I think that refers to the position relative to the aldehyde group). So substituent is a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane, with a -CHO group (carbaldehyde) on carbon 1, and another substituent that's a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group on the same carbon. So, the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group connected to another cyclohexane ring.

So the target molecule is like:

cyclohexane ring with a -CH2CHO group and a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group both attached to the same carbon.

Wait, no. The way the name reads is 1-(something) cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the aldehyde is on carbon 1 of cyclohexane, and the substituent is attached to that same carbon.

So the molecule is:

Cyclohexane with a -CHO group attached to carbon 1, and a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group also attached to carbon 1.

So that carbon 1 has both a carbonyl group (CHO) and a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group.

So the substituent is a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group on the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, but how do we get there from ethynylcyclohexane?

Perhaps the steps involve alkyne chemistry, adding substituents, hydrogenation, oxidation, and maybe some epoxidation or other steps.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: So deprotonate the alkyne to form acetylide, then alkylate with ethyl chloride to form a longer alkyne.

2. Li/LiNH3: That's a strong base, used for elimination reactions, perhaps to form an alkyne or to dehydrohalogenate.

Wait, after alkyne alkylation, what's the structure? Let's see, starting with cyclohexylacetylene. After deprotonation with NaNH2, we have the acetylide. Then adding ethyl chloride would give cyclohexyl-1-ethynyl-ethane? Or more accurately, the ethyl group would add to the acetylide, making CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane? Then, step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which is a condition for elimination, maybe forming a triple bond again or a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is longer. Then, step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps leading to a dehydrohalogenation. But if the alkyne is already an alkyne, maybe Li/NH3 would cause an elimination, perhaps forming a more substituted alkyne or converting it into a different structure. Alternatively, maybe it's used for a conjugate addition or elimination.

Then step 3 is O3 (ozone) followed by H2O. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So if step 2 creates a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

Step 4 is NH4OH, which is ammonium hydroxide, maybe used to work up ozonolysis or to hydrolyze some groups.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how all that would lead to the target.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: same as option A and others, so starts with forming the acetylide and methylating to make a longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenation with Pd, which would reduce the alkyne to an alkane. So the triple bond becomes a single bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozone followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup typically gives aldehydes or ketones, depending on the starting alkene. But wait, if step 2 produces an alkane, then step 3 would be ozonolysis on an alkane, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Unless step 2 gives an alkene.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So the alkyne would be hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, depending on the catalyst. But without any directing groups, it would just become a single bond. Wait, but in hydrogenation of alkynes, using H2 and Pd in presence of CaCO3 typically leads to full hydrogenation to a single bond, not a double bond. So after step 2, the alkyne becomes an alkane.

But then step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So that doesn't make sense. Unless step 2 didn't fully hydrogenate the alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the steps. Let me think: step 1 is methyl chloride, so alkyne becomes longer. Step 2 is hydrogenation, so alkyne becomes an alkane. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, but if the molecule is now an alkane, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the hydrogenation isn't of the alkyne but of another group.

Wait, maybe after alkylation, the alkyne becomes a substituted alkyne which upon hydrogenation gives a diol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are forming a diol, which upon ozonolysis would break into carbonyls.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: So deprotonate the alkyne to form acetylide, then react with methanol. Wait, methanol is an alcohol, so perhaps it's an alkylation with an alkoxide? Or maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Hmm, but methanol is not a good alkylating agent unless it's in a specific condition. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would react with methanol to form a methyl group. Wait, but methanol is CH3OH. So the acetylide [C≡C-]− would react with CH3OH to form CH3-O-C≡C-Cyclohexane? Or perhaps it's a substitution where the acetylide's proton is replaced by a methoxy group. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the -H on the triple bond is replaced by -OCH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonation followed by alkylation, but with methanol as the electrophile. Hmm, I'm not certain about that step.

Then, step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which is a strong base, used for elimination reactions, maybe forming a triple bond or a double bond.

Step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which could be for acid workup.

But I'm not sure how all these steps would lead to the target molecule.

Let me try to approach this differently. The target molecule has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring. Let's think about the possible synthetic steps to form both groups.

One possible approach is to form a ketone first, which can then be oxidized to an aldehyde. Alternatively, the aldehyde could be formed via oxidation of an alcohol, but primary alcohols oxidize to aldehydes under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via some kind of oxidation after forming the appropriate alcohol.

Looking at the options, the presence of O3 suggests ozonolysis, which could cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups.

So perhaps the overall plan is:

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane.

2. Form an alkyne with a substituent that can later be cleaved with ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

3. Then, introduce a hydroxyl group via some dihydroxylation or epoxide opening.

Wait, but let's think: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane and an aldehyde group on the same carbon. So maybe we need to form a diol first, then cleave it.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diene, then performing a [2+2] cycloaddition or some other reaction. No, that might complicate things.

Another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone via some oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If we have a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond, perhaps we can add substituents to the triple bond and then hydrogenate it to form rings.

Wait, let's think of the target molecule as having a bridge between two cyclohexane rings. The bridge is a CH(OH) group connected to the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the target is a bicyclic compound, like norbornene or something similar, but with substituents.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for the steps that would create both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. The presence of O3 and H2O (as in option A) or O3 and (CH3)2S (as in options C and D) suggests that at some point, a double bond is cleaved to form carbonyl groups.

So perhaps the molecule undergoes a dihydroxylation, then oxidation to form a diketone, which can then be cleaved into two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, then ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's outline a possible synthetic pathway:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to form acetylide.

2. Alkylate the acetylide with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne, like CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis or trans alkene, perhaps cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group.

Wait, but H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a propane chain?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. If the alkyne is CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane, hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the triple bond, turning it into CH2CH2-Cyclohexane. But that just becomes an ethyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me imagine the structure.

Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. Deprotonating gives the acetylide, which can be methylated to CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane. Then, hydrogenation would turn the triple bond into a single bond, making CH2CH2-Cyclohexane? Wait, that can't be right because that's just an ethyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the structure becomes CH2-CH2-Cyclohexane, which is just a cyclohexane with an ethyl group.

But then, how do we introduce the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups?

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the target molecule's formation in terms of protecting groups or specific functional group transformations.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached. So perhaps the substituent is derived from a diol, which upon oxidation gives an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is formed by a Robinson annulation or a similar reaction, but that might be more advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. If I could oxidize the triple bond to a ketone, that would give a cyclohexanone substituent. But how?

Wait, perhaps via ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a triple bond would typically break it into carbonyl groups. So if I can form a triple bond that is then cleaved by ozonolysis, perhaps I can form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the target has only one aldehyde group. So perhaps the molecule is such that ozonolysis would break a triple bond into two carbonyls, one of which is the aldehyde.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think about each option again, considering the steps.

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: form acetylide and methylate.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the alkyne.

Wait, so after step 1, the alkyne is longer, perhaps CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

Step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, giving CH2CH2-Cyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a propyl group? Wait, no: CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane becomes CH2CH2-Cyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group. Wait, that's just an ethyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. So, the alkyne becomes a single bond, so the structure becomes CH2CH2-Cyclohexane. No, that can't be right. Wait, the alkyne is CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane. So upon hydrogenation, it would become CH3-CH2-Cyclohexane, a propyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

But then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is ozonolysis with a reductive workup. But if the structure is CH3-CH2-Cyclohexane, there's no double bond to ozonolyze. So that doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C's step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the alkyne fully, but instead does something else.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation of a different functional group. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reagents.

Wait, another thought: perhaps step 1 forms a di-substituted acetylide, which upon hydrogenation gives a di-substituted alkene. Oh, wait, maybe after alkylation, the alkyne is internal, so hydrogenation would stop at the alkene.

Wait, but H2/Pd typically goes to full hydrogenation. Unless it's poisoned, but that's not indicated here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or some other structure that can be cleaved.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the reagents in each option and their purposes.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, the acetylide would react with methanol. But methanol is an alcohol, not an alkylating agent. So maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would attack a methyl group from methanol, leading to a longer alkyne.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base; it deprotonates the ethynyl group to form the acetylide. Then, if we have methanol, perhaps the acetylide would react with it. But methanol is not a good electrophile for alkylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a quench step. Wait, I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used for elimination, perhaps for forming a triple bond or a double bond. Wait, but if the alkyne was already formed, what's the point?

Alternatively, maybe the methanol in step 1 is used for something else, like a Grignard-like reaction. But I'm not certain.

This is getting a bit too complicated. Maybe I should think about the correct sequence of reagents to form the target.

The target has a hydroxymethyl group and a carbaldehyde group on the same carbon. So perhaps we need to introduce an aldehyde via oxidation, and a hydroxyl group via some dihydroxylation or epoxide opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is formed via a Grignard reaction or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then modified to form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is transformed into a ketone via oxidation. Ozonolysis, for example, could break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis typically works on double bonds, not triple bonds. Unless it's a different condition. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is first converted into a double bond, then ozonolysis is used.

Hmm, maybe the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate and alkylate to form a longer alkyne.

2. Partially hydrogenate the alkyne to a double bond.

3. Ozonolyse the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. Introduce hydroxyl groups via some diol formation.

But I'm not exactly certain.

Looking at the options, I think option C might be the correct one. Let's think why.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: form acetylide and methylate to form CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the alkyne to CH2CH2-Cyclohexane. Wait, but that's a single bond, which doesn't have a double bond for ozonolysis.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe step 2 in option C is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene. But under H2 and Pd, it would typically go all the way to the single bond. Unless it's a Lindlar catalyst, which would stop at the cis double bond. But the option says Pd-calcium carbonate, which is probably for full hydrogenation.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is done in a way that only a part of the alkyne is hydrogenated. Or perhaps the alkyne is not the one being hydrogenated.

Wait, maybe after step 1, the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH2-Cyclohexane. Then, step 2 hydrogenates it to CH2CH2-CH2-Cyclohexane, which is a propyl group.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis. But without a double bond, I'm not sure. Unless step 2 actually forms a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that forms a ring, leading to a cyclopropane or another structure. I'm not sure.

This is getting too tangled. Perhaps I should think about which option, when followed, would produce the target molecule.

Another approach: the target has a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde group on the same carbon. So perhaps the molecule is formed via the formation of a diol, which is then oxidized to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure how the diol would form.

Looking back at the options, option B's steps include Li and liquid NH3, which is a strong base used for eliminations. Maybe that's for forming a double bond.

So, perhaps the steps in option B are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2 → acetylide.

2. Alkylate with ethyl chloride → longer alkyne.

3. Li and NH3 → elimination, forming a triple bond again? Or perhaps a double bond.

4. Ozonolysis → cleave the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

5. Workup with NH4OH.

Wait, but if after step 3, there's a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

But how would that form the target?

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 forms a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the steps involve forming a bicyclic structure.

Wait, another idea: the target has a bridge between two cyclohexane rings, so maybe the starting material is converted into a bicyclic compound via some [2+2] or other cycloaddition.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent without a clear path, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the reagents.

The target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. To form an aldehyde, one common method is oxidation of a primary alcohol. Alternatively, ozonolysis can form aldehydes from alkenes.

So perhaps the plan is:

1. Convert the alkyne into an alkene.

2. Ozonolyze the alkene to form an aldehyde and a ketone or another aldehyde.

3. Introduce a hydroxyl group via some dihydroxylation or epoxide opening.

But I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, I think option D might be correct.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → form acetylide and methylate. Wait, but methanol is CH3OH. So the acetylide [C≡C-]− would react with CH3OH to form CH3-O-C≡C-Cyclohexane? But that would be an ether, which doesn't seem relevant. Alternatively, it might form a methyl group via substitution, but I'm not certain.

2. Li and liquid NH3: strong base, perhaps for elimination. Maybe the structure after step 1 has a leaving group, and this step removes it, forming a triple bond or a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: cleaves double bonds into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH: perhaps for workup, acid workup.

But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves forming a diol first, then oxidizing to form an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule's substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So perhaps the substituent is formed by the addition of a cyclohexyl group to a hydroxymethyl group, which is then attached to the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps via a Grignard reaction. But I don't see Grignard reagents in the options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the acetylide, then hydrogenate to form an alkane, then perform ozonolysis (but that doesn't make sense because ozonolysis requires a double bond).

Wait, let's think about the possible steps again.

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide with NaNH2.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride → longer alkyne, CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

3. Hydrogenation → CH2CH2-Cyclohexane.

4. Ozonolysis → If there's a double bond, it would cleave into carbonyls. But after hydrogenation, it's a single bond, so no double bond. So option A's step 3 is Ba(OH)2 and step 4 is Jones oxidation.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe used for elimination or oxidation. Jones oxidation (CrO3 in H2SO4) oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but maybe in this case, it's used differently.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used to form a diol from an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps after step 2 in option A, the molecule is CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane, which upon hydrogenation becomes CH2CH2-Cyclohexane. Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which might cause elimination to form a diene. Then step 4 is oxidation to form a diketone or other groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option C:

1. Acetylide methylated → CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenate → CH2CH2-Cyclohexane.

3. Ozonolysis → no double bond, so no reaction.

So that can't be right.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the target structure again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

It has a cyclohexane ring (let's call it ring A) with two substituents on carbon 1: a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group (ring B).

So, the substituent is a CH(OH)- group attached to ring B, which is another cyclohexane.

So, how to form that?

Perhaps via a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclopropane formation.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is used to form a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are:

1. Form a longer alkyne by alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate to form a bridge.

3. Ozonolyze to form the aldehyde.

4. Introduce the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then functionalized.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then subjected to some kind of addition to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure which reagents would do that.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option D is the right one. Let's see.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: form acetylide and methylate. Wait, but methanol isn't a good alkylating agent. So perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form a methyl ether. But I'm not sure.

2. Li, liquid NH3: strong base, maybe for elimination. If the structure has a leaving group, this would eliminate it, forming a double or triple bond.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: perhaps to hydrolyze any protecting groups or to form an amine.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Option C:

1. Acetylide methylated → longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenated → alkane.

3. Ozonolysis: but no double bond, so no reaction. So this can't be right.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about each step in each option and see which sequence logically leads to the target.

Let's take option C again.

Step 1: Acetylide methylated → longer alkyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to single bond (alkane).

Step3: O3/ (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But with an alkane, nothing happens. So that's no good.

Thus, option C can't be correct.

Option B:

Step 1: Acetylide ethylated → longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li, NH3 → elimination, perhaps to form a triple bond or a double bond.

If step 1 gives CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane, then step 2 with Li and NH3 would deprotonate and eliminate, perhaps forming a longer triple bond or a double bond.

Assuming it forms a double bond, then step3: ozone would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, if the alkene is between C1 and C2, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Then, step4: NH4OH would work up the ozonolysis, perhaps forming aldehydes.

But how would that lead to the target molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the cleavage forms an aldehyde and another group, which upon further reaction would form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Option A:

Step3: Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination or oxidation.

Step4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation.

So, after step 2 (H2/Pd), the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane. Then, Ba(OH)2 would perhaps cause elimination, forming an alkene. Then, Jones oxidation would oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. But without an alcohol, I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to form a cyclohexanol derivative, then oxidize to form a ketone, and further.

But I'm not seeing the link.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this and need to make an educated guess. Based on the reagents, I think option D is correct because it includes Li and NH3, which are used for eliminations that can form rings or alkenes, and then ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: The target molecule has a bridge between two cyclohexane rings. To form such a bridge, perhaps a [2+2] cycloaddition or a similar process is used. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a bicyclic structure via hydride reduction or some other method.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll go with option C. Wait, no, earlier I thought option C's steps don't make sense because after hydrogenation, there's no double bond for ozonolysis.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, no. Wait, another approach: the target has a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde group. So perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne to alkyne with methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate to form an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form an aldehyde and another carbonyl group.

4. Introduce hydroxyl group via some dihydroxylation.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, the molecule is cleaved into two parts, and then a Grignard reaction adds a new group.

But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'm going to make a guess. I think option C is the correct one.


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane using the given reagent sequences. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group (carbaldehyde) and a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which is methylated to form a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in an alkane.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or oxidation.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, typically used to oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.

However, after hydrogenation, there is no double bond for ozonolysis, and the sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of both the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and alkylates it with an ethyl group, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/LiNH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination to form a double bond.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Likely used for workup after ozonolysis.

This sequence could potentially form carbonyl groups, but it is unclear how the hydroxymethyl group and aldehyde group are introduced in the correct positions.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and methylates it, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in an alkane.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the molecule is now an alkane, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or oxidation.

This sequence is flawed because ozonolysis cannot act on an alkane, and the steps do not lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group, and methanol may act as a nucleophile or electrophile, though its role is unclear.
2. **Li/LiNH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination to form a double bond or triple bond.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Likely used for workup after ozonolysis.

This sequence could potentially form carbonyl groups, but the role of methanol in step 1 is ambiguous, and the overall pathway to the target molecule is unclear.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and logically leads to the formation of the target molecule. However, based on the reagents and the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite the ambiguity in step 3.

**Answer: C**
