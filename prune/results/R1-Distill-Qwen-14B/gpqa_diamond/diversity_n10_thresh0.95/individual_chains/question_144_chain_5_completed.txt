Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula should be something like L = gamma * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

First, I need to calculate the lifetime tau. I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ = ħ / tau, but I might get this mixed up. Oh right, the natural line width formula is Γ = ħ/(tau), so tau = ħ/(Γ). But wait, I should also consider units here because ħ is in Planck units. I think ħ is about 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds? Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Hmm, 6.582 / 0.32 is around 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah.

Next, I need to find gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is E/(m c^2), but since E is given in GeV and m is also in GeV/c², perhaps. Wait, relativistic units can be confusing. Alternatively, gamma is just E_rest / m, since E = gamma m c², but when m is in energy units (GeV), perhaps I can ignore the c² terms because they might be accounted for in the units. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused there.

Wait, in natural units where c=1, E in GeV and mass m in GeV/c² would require E = gamma m. Wait, no, because E = gamma m c². So if m is given in GeV/c², then E = gamma * (m in GeV/c²) * c². But since E is in GeV, and c² is (m/s)^2, perhaps I should be careful with the units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute gamma as E / m. Because E is the total energy, and m is the rest mass, so gamma = E/(m c²) * c²? Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think in terms of units. If E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², then E/(m c²) would have units of GeV / (GeV/c² * m²/s²) ), which is a bit messy. Maybe it's better to just compute gamma as E/(m c²) multiplied by c². Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, since E is given as 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, then gamma would be E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) * (1/c²) * c²? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But m is given in GeV/c², so m c² would be GeV. So E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Ok, so gamma is 6.6667. Now, velocity beta is v/c. For a relativistic particle, beta is approximately 1 when gamma is large. But wait, since gamma is 6.6667, beta would be sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ 1 - (1/(2 gamma²)) ). For gamma=6.6667, 1/(2*(6.6667)^2) is about 1/(88.8889) ≈ 0.01125. So beta is about 0.98875. So the velocity is approximately 0.98875c.

But wait, perhaps for high gamma, beta is approximately 1. But maybe we can be more precise. Alternatively, perhaps I can just proceed with beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Let me compute that. gamma is 6.66666667, so 1/gamma² is (1/6.66666667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887, same as before. So beta is ~0.9887c.

Now, the lifetime we found was tau = ħ/(Γ) = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056e-24 seconds.

But wait, the lifetime tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. The lab frame (the one where the particle is moving) would have a longer lifetime, which is gamma multiplied by tau. So the mean lifetime is gamma * tau.

So the mean lifetime is gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056e-24 s ≈ 1.3707e-23 seconds. 

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused about the proper lifetime. Let me correct: actually, the proper lifetime is tau, which is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation: t = gamma * tau.

So the lab frame lifetime is t = gamma * tau.

Now, the decay length L is the velocity in the lab frame multiplied by the mean lifetime. Because L = v * t. Wait, no, wait: the mean distance is the velocity multiplied by the mean lifetime, but the velocity is in the lab frame. So L = beta c * gamma tau. Because beta c is the velocity, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Alternatively, L can be written as beta gamma c tau.

Wait, let me think again. The lab frame measures the lifetime as gamma tau. The velocity is beta c. So L = velocity * time = beta c * (gamma tau).

So, L = beta gamma c tau.

Alternatively, another approach: since when you have a particle moving with speed v, the mean decay length is L = (gamma v) * (tau) * c? Hmm, maybe not. Let me make sure.

Wait, no, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. The speed is beta c. So the distance is L = (beta c) * (gamma tau) = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, another way: the mean lifetime is gamma tau, so the mean distance is speed * mean lifetime. So yes, L = beta c * gamma tau.

So putting it all together:

L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Wait, but beta is v/c, so beta c is v. So yes, L = v * gamma tau. But perhaps it's easier to compute it as beta gamma c tau.

Let me compute each part step by step.

So, beta is approximately 0.9887, gamma is 6.6667.

So beta gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.9887 * 6.6667.

0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322.

0.9887 * 0.6667 ≈ approximately 0.9887 * 2/3 ≈ 0.6591.

So total is approximately 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.

So beta gamma ≈ 6.5913.

Now, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

Tau was 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So putting it together:

L = beta gamma c tau.

So L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that:

First, multiply 6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9.

Then, multiply that by 2.056875e-24.

So 1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.97739 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

Calculating 1.97739 * 2.056875:

Hmm, 2 * 2.056875 is 4.11375. But 1.97739 is about 2 - 0.02261. So 2 * 2.056875 is 4.11375, minus 0.02261 * 2.056875.

0.02261 * 2.056875 ≈ approximately 0.04657.

So 4.11375 - 0.04657 ≈ 4.06718.

So the product is approximately 4.06718e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. So 4.067e-15 is close to option B.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me go through the exact numbers again.

Compute beta gamma:

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666666667...

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma is 6.6666666667, so gamma^2 is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.44444.

So 1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is exactly sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach: 0.9887^2 = 0.9775 because 0.99^2 is 0.9801, 0.98^2=0.9604, 0.988^2= (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144. Hmm, that's not 0.9775. Wait, maybe I need a better approximation.

Wait, 0.9887 squared: let's compute 0.9887 * 0.9887.

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Compute 9887 * 9887, then move the decimal.

But perhaps it's easier to compute as (a + b)^2.

Let me think: 0.9887 is approximately 0.98 + 0.0087.

So, (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*(0.98)(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 = 1.96 * 0.0087 = approximately 0.017052.

0.0087^2 = 0.00007569.

Adding them up: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, which matches.

So beta is exactly 0.9887?

Wait, why? Because (0.9887)^2 is approximately 0.977527, which is a bit higher than 0.9775, so perhaps it's 0.9887.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's try 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*(0.98)(0.0087) + 0.0087².

Compute 2*0.98*0.0087 = 1.96 * 0.0087 = 0.017052.

0.0087² = 0.00007569.

So 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452.

Plus 0.00007569 is 0.97752769.

But we need sqrt(0.9775), which is a bit less than 0.9887.

So perhaps beta is approximately 0.9887 - a little bit. Let's see, let me compute 0.9886^2.

Wait, 0.9886 * 0.9886:

We can compute (0.9887 - 0.0001)² = 0.9887² - 2*0.9887*0.0001 + 0.0001².

Which is 0.977527 - 0.00019774 + 0.00000001 = approximately 0.977330.

Which is 0.97733, still less than 0.9775.

Hmm, so between 0.9886 and 0.9887, the square is 0.97733 and 0.977527 respectively. We want the square to be 0.9775.

So the difference between 0.9775 and 0.97733 is 0.00017. Between 0.9886 and 0.9887, the square increases by about 0.00019774 (from 0.97733 to 0.977527).

So to get 0.9775, we need to find how much between 0.9886 and 0.9887.

Let delta be the fraction beyond 0.9886.

So 0.9886 + delta * (0.9887 - 0.9886) = 0.9886 + delta*(0.0001) = value.

The square is (0.9886)^2 + 2*(0.9886)*delta*(0.0001) + (delta * 0.0001)^2.

We can ignore the last term as small.

We need (0.9886)^2 + 2*0.9886*0.0001 * delta = 0.9775.

(0.9886)^2 is approx 0.97733.

So 0.97733 + 2*0.9886*0.0001 * delta = 0.9775.

So 0.97733 + (0.00019772) * delta = 0.9775.

Subtracting 0.97733: 0.00019772 * delta = 0.00017.

So delta = 0.00017 / 0.00019772 ≈ 0.860.

So beta is approximately 0.9886 + 0.860 * 0.0001 = 0.988686.

So beta ≈ 0.988686.

So beta is approximately 0.988686.

So beta gamma is 0.988686 * 6.666666667.

Compute that:

6.666666667 * 0.988686.

Let me compute 6.666666667 * 0.988686.

Well, 6.666666667 is 20/3.

But perhaps compute 6.666666667 * 0.988686 = ?

6 * 0.988686 = 5.932116.

0.666666667 * 0.988686 ≈ 0.666666667 * 0.988686 ≈ 0.659124.

Adding together, 5.932116 + 0.659124 ≈ 6.59124.

So beta gamma ≈ 6.59124.

Now, let's compute L = beta gamma c tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau was 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = beta gamma * c * tau.

So beta gamma is 6.59124, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply all together.

So 6.59124 * 3e8 m/s = 1.977372e9 m/s.

Then, 1.977372e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 1.977372e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977372 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.977372 * 2.056875.

Hmm, 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375. But 1.977372 is 0.022628 less than 2.

So 2.056875 * (2 - 0.022628) = 4.11375 - (0.022628 * 2.056875).

Compute 0.022628 * 2.056875.

0.02 * 2.056875 = 0.0411375.

0.002628 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.00541.

So total is approximately 0.0411375 + 0.00541 = 0.0465475.

So 4.11375 - 0.0465475 = 4.0672025.

So L ≈ 4.0672e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Option C is 5.0223e-15, which is a bit higher.

Wait, but perhaps I made an error in precise calculation. Let me compute 1.977372 * 2.056875 exactly.

Wait, 1.977372 * 2.056875.

Break it down:

=1.977372 * 2 + 1.977372 * 0.056875.

=3.954744 + (1.977372 * 0.056875).

Compute 1.977372 * 0.056875.

0.056875 is 56875/1e6.

But perhaps compute 1.977372 * 0.056875:

1.977372 * 5.6875e-2.

1.977372 * 5e-2 = 0.0988686.

1.977372 * 0.6875e-2 = approximately 0.0135798.

Wait, 0.056875 is 0.05 + 0.006875.

So 1.977372 * 0.05 = 0.0988686.

1.977372 * 0.006875 = ?

0.006875 = 1/144.

Wait, 1.977372 * 1/144 = approximately 0.013719.

So 0.0988686 + 0.013719 ≈ 0.1125876.

So the second part is 0.1125876.

So total is 3.954744 + 0.1125876 ≈ 4.0673316.

So L = 4.0673316e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. Perhaps the exact calculation would yield that.

Wait, but let me check the initial calculation of tau.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

Tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = let me compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 = ?

Well, 0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182.

So 20 + (0.182/0.32) = 20 + 0.56875 = 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the calculation of beta gamma.

Wait, gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta gamma is 0.9887 * 6.666666667 ≈ 6.5912.

So L = 6.5912 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

6.5912 * 3e8 = 1.97736e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.97736e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.97736 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97736 * 2.056875.

Let me compute that more accurately.

2.056875 = 2 + 0.056875.

So 1.97736 * 2 = 3.95472.

1.97736 * 0.056875 = ?

Compute 1.97736 * 0.05 = 0.098868.

1.97736 * 0.006875 = 0.013579.

Adding them gives 0.098868 + 0.013579 = 0.112447.

So total is 3.95472 + 0.112447 = 4.067167.

So L ≈4.067167e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Our calculated value is around 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B.

Wait, but option B is 4.0655e-15, which is just a bit lower than our calculation. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for beta would change it slightly.

Let me compute beta more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach.

Compute beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

gamma squared is (6.666666666666667)^2 = 44.44444444444444.

1/gamma squared is 0.0225.

So 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 0.9775.

Now, compute sqrt(0.9775) accurately.

Using the Taylor expansion around x=1: sqrt(x) ≈ 1 - (1 - x)/2 - (1 - x)^2/8 + ... 

Wait, x is 0.9775, which is 0.0225 less than 1.

So let me compute sqrt(0.9775) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 1 - (0.0225)/(2) - (0.0225)^2/(8) - ... 

Compute up to the second term.

1 - 0.01125 = 0.98875.

But the third term is (0.0225)^2 / 8 = (0.00050625)/8 = 0.00006328125.

So subtract that: 0.98875 - 0.00006328125 = 0.98868671875.

So beta ≈ 0.98868671875.

So beta gamma = 0.98868671875 * 6.666666666666667.

Compute this product.

Compute 0.98868671875 * 6 = 5.9321203125.

0.98868671875 * 0.6666666666666666 ≈ 0.6591244791666666.

Adding together: 5.9321203125 + 0.6591244791666666 ≈ 6.591244791666666.

So beta gamma ≈6.591244791666666.

Now, L = beta gamma * c * tau.

c is 2.99792458e8 m/s (using more precise value).

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L =6.591244791666666 * 2.99792458e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

First, compute 6.591244791666666 * 2.99792458e8.

6.591244791666666 * 2.99792458 = let's compute:

6 * 2.99792458 = 17.98754748.

0.5912447916666666 * 2.99792458 ≈ 0.59124479 * 3 ≈ 1.77373437, but since 2.9979 is ~3, so more precisely:

0.59124479 * 2.99792458 ≈ 0.59124479 * 3 = 1.77373437 minus 0.59124479 * 0.00207542 ≈ 0.0012224.

So approximately 1.77373437 - 0.0012224 ≈ 1.77251197.

So total is 17.98754748 + 1.77251197 ≈ 19.76005945.

So 6.591244791666666 * 2.99792458e8 m/s = 1.976005945e9 m/s.

Now, multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):

1.976005945e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.976005945 * 2.056875 * 1e-15 m.

Compute 1.976005945 * 2.056875.

1.976005945 * 2 = 3.95201189.

1.976005945 * 0.056875 = ?

Compute 1.976005945 * 0.05 = 0.09880029725.

1.976005945 * 0.006875 = 0.01357503711.

Adding these: 0.09880029725 + 0.01357503711 ≈ 0.11237533436.

So total is 3.95201189 + 0.11237533436 ≈ 4.06438722436.

So L ≈4.06438722436e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.06439e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 2.99792458 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the decay width,
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the production energy,
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is the mass of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Since \( E \) and \( m c^2 \) are given in the same units (GeV), we can simplify:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\gamma^2 = \left( \frac{8}{1.2} \right)^2 = 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.9775
\]

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5912
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
L = 6.5912 \times (2.99792458 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma c \):

\[
\beta \gamma c = 6.5912 \times 2.99792458 \times 10^8 \approx 1.976005945 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Now, multiply by \( \tau \):

\[
L = 1.976005945 \times 10^9 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}
\]

\[
L = (1.976005945 \times 2.056875) \times 10^{-15} \approx 4.06439 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Compare with options
The calculated decay distance is approximately \( 4.06439 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which is closest to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).
