Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy E_X, which is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in terms of meters, so I need to calculate the distance the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = γ * v * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But first, I think I need to find the lifetime τ. Oh yeah, the relation between the decay width Γ and the lifetime τ is given by the uncertainty principle: Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units are important here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units like GeV·s, so I need to make sure the units work out.

Wait, what's the value of ħ in GeV·seconds? I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yeah, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant over 2pi is about 6.58e-25 GeV·s.

So, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me do that calculation. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, I need to find the velocity v. But to get v, I think I need to find the energy E of the meson. The production energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So, the energy is much higher than the rest mass, which means it's relativistic.

The energy E is related to the rest mass by E = γ m c². Oh wait, but since the units are in GeV and the mass is given in GeV/c², maybe I can work in natural units where c=1, so E = γ m. So γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So γ is 6.6667.

Wait, but I need the velocity. Hmm, the relation between gamma and velocity is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²). Alternatively, v = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, let's compute v. For γ=6.6667, 1/γ² is 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775). What's sqrt(0.9775)? Approximately 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

But maybe I should use a more precise calculation. Let me think. For γ=8/(1.2)=6.6666667. So 1/(γ²)=1/(44.4444444)=0.0225. 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Alternatively, we can compute v as:

v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Since E is much larger than m, v is close to c, so perhaps we can approximate v ≈ c, but let's see. Hmm, but for precise calculation, I should use the exact formula.

But wait, perhaps there's a simpler way. Because the mean decay length is also given by L = cτ * β γ, where β is v/c, and γ is the Lorentz factor. Oh wait, that's another way to express it.

So, L = c τ γ β.

Wait, but since τ = ħ / Γ, and Γ is given, perhaps I can compute τ, then find gamma and beta from the energy E and mass m.

So, let's recap. The proper lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Then, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is γ τ. The distance is then v multiplied by that time: L = v * (γ τ) = γ v τ. Which is the same as c τ γ (v/c) = c τ γ β.

So, L = c * τ * γ β.

So, I can compute each part step by step.

First, compute τ again. τ = ħ / Γ.

Given:

ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s. Let me compute that exactly: 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.

Next, find gamma and beta. E = gamma m c^2, and since we're using units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

Beta is v/c. So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) )? Wait wait, no, gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, perhaps I should re-express beta in terms of E and m.

Alternatively, beta = (p c^2)/(E), where p is the momentum. Hmm, but E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2. So, p = sqrt(E^2 - m² c^4) / c.

But perhaps an easier way is to use beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, but again, in natural units where c=1, beta is sqrt(1 - m²/E²).

So, E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So, m² = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 GeV².

E² =64 GeV².

So, m² / E² = 1.44 /64 = 0.0225.

So, 1 - m²/E² = 0.9775.

So, beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So, beta is approximately 0.9887.

Now, L = c * τ * gamma * beta.

Let me compute each part.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So, c = 3e8 m/s.

Putting it all together:

L = (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) * (6.6666667) * (0.9887).

Let me compute the numbers step by step.

First, compute the product of gamma and beta: 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 6 * 0.9887 =5.9322, 0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591. So total around 6.5913.

More precisely, let's calculate 6.6666667 * 0.9887.

6.6666667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6666667 * 0.9887 = 0.6591334.

Adding together: 5.9322 + 0.6591334 ≈ 6.5913.

So, gamma*beta ≈6.5913.

Now, multiply c * tau: (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Wait, 3e8 * 2e-24 = 6e-16, but more accurately:

3 * 2.056875 =6.170625. So 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by gamma*beta (6.5913):

6.170625e-16 m * 6.5913 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6.170625 *6.5913.

6 *6=36. 6 *0.5913=3.5478.

0.170625 *6 =1.02375.

0.170625 *0.5913≈0.1009.

So, roughly 36 +3.5478 +1.02375 + 0.1009.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 6.170625 *6.5913.

Let me approximate:

6 *6.5913 =39.5478.

0.170625 *6.5913 ≈ (0.17 *6.5913) + (0.000625 *6.5913) → approx 1.1205 + 0.00412 ≈1.1246.

So total is approx 39.5478 + 1.1246 =40.6724.

So, 6.170625e-16 m * 6.5913 ≈40.6724e-16 m =4.06724e-15 m.

Wait, 40.6724e-16 is 4.06724e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m, etc.

Hmm. My calculation gives approximately 4.067e-15 m. So option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma * beta.

Wait, let me compute gamma * beta more accurately.

gamma is 8 /1.2 =6.6666666667.

beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)).

Wait, 1.2^2=1.44 and 8^2=64. So 1.44/64=0.0225.

So sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887.

But let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more precisely.

0.9775 is 391/400 approximately, but perhaps better to compute it numerically.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775):

We know that 0.9887^2 = (approx) 0.9775.

Wait, 0.9887 * 0.9887 = ?

Well, 0.98 *0.98=0.9604.

0.98 * 0.0087=0.008526.

0.0087 *0.98=0.008526.

0.0087 *0.0087= approx 0.00007569.

Wait, perhaps another approach: exact calculation.

(0.9887)^2 = ?

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Let me compute 9887 *9887.

Wait, 9887 squared is (10000 - 113)^2 = 10000^2 - 2 *10000 *113 + 113^2.

Which is 100000000 - 2260000 + 12769 = 97744769.

So, 9887^2=97744769.

So, 0.9887^2 = (9887/10000)^2 = 97744769 / 1e8 = 0.97744769.

But our value is 0.9775, which is 0.9775 - 0.97744769=0.0000523 more.

So, 0.9887^2 is 0.97744769, which is less than 0.9775 by 0.00005231.

So, let's compute 0.9887 + x, where x is small, such that (0.9887 +x)^2 =0.9775.

Expanding, 0.9887^2 + 2*0.9887 x +x² = 0.9775.

We know 0.9887^2 = 0.97744769, so:

0.97744769 + 2*0.9887 x ≈0.9775.

2 *0.9887 x ≈ 0.9775 -0.97744769 =0.00005231.

So, x ≈ 0.00005231/(2 *0.9887) ≈0.00005231/(1.9774) ≈approx 2.645e-5.

So, x≈0.00002645.

So, sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887 +0.00002645≈0.98872645.

So, beta is approximately 0.988726.

So, perhaps beta is approximately 0.988726.

So, gamma * beta =6.6666666667 *0.988726 ≈ let's compute that.

6 *0.988726=5.932356.

0.6666666667 *0.988726≈0.65915067.

Adding together: 5.932356+0.65915067 ≈6.5915066.

So, gamma*beta≈6.5915.

Now, let's recalculate L.

c =3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So, c * tau =3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply this by gamma*beta=6.5915066:

6.170625e-16 *6.5915066 = ?

Let me compute 6.170625 *6.5915066.

6 *6.5915 is 39.549.

0.170625 *6.5915066 ≈approx 1.1244.

Adding together: 39.549 +1.1244 =40.6734.

So, 40.6734e-16 m is 4.06734e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

Hmm, but why the slight discrepancy? Maybe due to more precise calculation of beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ.

Wait, my ħ value was 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Maybe it's 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

Another point: perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation of tau.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

So, ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

Γ=320 MeV=0.32 GeV.

So, tau=6.582e-25 /0.32 = ?

6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875.

So, 2.056875e-24 s.
