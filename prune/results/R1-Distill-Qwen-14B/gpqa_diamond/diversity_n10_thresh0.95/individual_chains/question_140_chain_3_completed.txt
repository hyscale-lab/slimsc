--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

So, the problem talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is close to room temperature, maybe slightly below since 273 K is 0°C. Then, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, let's think about gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule must have equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of possible gases. Maybe H2O? No, because H and O don't balance. Wait, another thought: Maybe NH3? No, because N has 7 protons. Wait, but the molecule's total would have to have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Or perhaps CO2? Or maybe something simpler, like H2, but that's just two protons and two neutrons (each H has 1 proton, maybe deuterium? So two neutrons in total).

Wait, another approach: The gas's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible molecules.

Each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, the sum of all protons equals the sum of all neutrons in the molecule.

Examples:

- H2O: H2O has 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutron) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2*1 +8=10. Neutrons: 8. Not equal.

- CH4: C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 4 H. Protons:6+4=10. Neutrons:6. Not equal.

- CO2: C (6 protons, 6 neutrons), 2 O (8 each). Protons:6+2*8=22. Neutrons:6 + 2*8=22. Oh! That works. So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in the molecule.

Wait, but wait. Each O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So each O contributes 8 protons and 8 neutrons. C contributes 6 each. So CO2 would have 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. So yes, same number.

But wait, O can have isotopes. So depending on isotopes, the number of neutrons per O atom could vary. But the problem says gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So maybe the isotopes don't affect this because it's the sum. Wait, but if O is from O-16, which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, then yes, in CO2, as I thought.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think about another possibility. Like, let's say H2O has 2 H (1p each) and O (8p). Protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: O has 8. So 10 vs 8. Not equal. But if the O was a heavier isotope, like O-18, which has 10 neutrons. Then, O-18: 8 protons, 10 neutrons. So CO2 with O-16 and O-18? Hmm, but that complicates the gas's composition.

Alternatively, maybe O2 gas? No, O2 has 16 protons (each O has 8), so 16 protons. Neutrons per molecule: each O-16 has 8, so 16. So O2 would have 16 protons, 16 neutrons. That would fit. So the gas W could be O2.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule. Let me check: O has 8 protons. So O2 has 16 protons. Each O is O-16, so 8 neutrons each, so 16 total. So 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So that matches.

But the problem says gas W is released when X reacts with Y. Let's think about other parts now.

Precipitate G forms when X and Y react. Heating G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 3.85°C, so just above 0. What solid melts around that temperature? Maybe something like water ice? No, water's melting point is 273 K. But 277 is just a bit higher, so perhaps another substance. Or maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, I think it's more likely to be something else. Maybe something like NaOH? No, that's solid at higher temps. Or perhaps something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl has a high melting point. Or maybe it's something like ammonium nitrate, which can have lower melting points but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium bicarbonate? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. What substance's melting point is near that? Maybe something like NH4NO3? I think it's higher. Alternatively, maybe B is something like Mg(OH)2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W (maybe O2), precipitate G (maybe a metal hydroxide?), which when heated gives B. So maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid. For example, if X is a metal, Y is an acid, producing H2 gas (but earlier I thought W could be O2, but maybe another possibility). Or perhaps X is a base and Y is an acid, producing a salt and water.

Wait, the initial reaction is between X and Y, which is a liquid. So if Y is a liquid, perhaps it's water. Or maybe another liquid like HCl.

Wait, but if X is a heavier isotope of one of its elements, perhaps it's a metal that's an isotope of hydrogen, like deuterium. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids have a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. For example, something like acetoacetic acid. When X reacts with it, the product has 2 O atoms. So perhaps X is a reducing agent that reduces the keto acid. Maybe X is something like NaBH4 (sodium borohydride), which is a common reagent in organic chemistry. Because sodium borohydride is used to reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols. But wait, NaBH4's formula is NaBH4. So if a keto acid (like a ketone acid) reacts with it, perhaps it reduces the ketone group.

Wait, but the product has 2 O atoms. Let me think: the keto acid has more oxygen, like maybe a molecule with three or more O atoms. If X is NaBH4, the product would have an alcohol group. But I'm not sure how that leads to 2 O atoms. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another thought: if X is a heavy water component, like D2O, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps X is something like H2O, but that may not fit.

Wait, but going back to the reaction. X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W. If Y is a strong acid, maybe H2SO4, and X is a metal. Then the reaction could produce H2 gas. But earlier, I thought W could be O2, but maybe I was wrong.

Alternatively, let's think of a violent reaction. Maybe a metal reacting with an acid to produce H2 gas. So W is H2. Let's see: H2 has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons if it's H-1. So the molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. That's not equal. So that doesn't fit. So maybe W isn't H2.

Wait, maybe gas W is CO2. Because when something like carbonate reacts with acid, CO2 is released. So X could be a carbonate. Let's see: if X is Na2CO3, and Y is H2SO4 (a liquid acid), then the reaction would produce CO2 gas, Na2SO4, and water. So W would be CO2. As earlier, CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits. So W is CO2.

So gas W is CO2, which would mean that the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So X could be a carbonate, and Y is an acid. Then, precipitate G could be a sulfate, perhaps.

Wait, but the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If G is a carbonate, perhaps not, but if it's a hydroxide, maybe. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, heating it could give a metal oxide. For example, if X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce the metal sulfate, CO2, and water. Wait, but in that case, the precipitate would be the metal sulfate if it's insoluble. Alternatively, if Y is a strong acid and X is a carbonate of a metal that forms a soluble sulfate, then no precipitate would form. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe Y is not an acid but another substance. Let me think about this.

Another angle: the melting point of B is about 277 K, which is 4°C. What's a solid that melts just above 0°C? Perhaps something like ammonium nitrate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ice, but that's 273 K. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: if G is a hydroxide, heating it might dehydrate it. For example, heating Mg(OH)2 gives MgO and water. But Mg(OH)2 has a melting point around 580°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G is a carbonate. Heating a carbonate would produce CO2 and the corresponding metal oxide. For example, heating Na2CO3 gives Na2O and CO2, but again, melting points are higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium chloride, which has a high melting point, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps B is another gas. Or perhaps B is a solid with a low melting point. Let me think about what has a melting point near 277 K. Maybe something like paraffin wax? No, that's higher. Or perhaps something like a simple hydrocarbon, but that's more of a liquid. Alternatively, maybe it's a different diatomic gas. Wait, O2's melting point is about 54 K, so that's not it. CO2's melting point is around 217 K, so that's close. Hmm, but the problem says B's melting point is very close to 277 K, which is 4°C.

Wait, another approach: perhaps B is a solid with a melting point just above 0°C. Maybe it's a simple alkali metal, but their melting points are higher. Wait, let's think: what is the melting point of sodium? It's about 371 K (98°C), which is higher. Potassium is around 337 K (64°C). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think about substances that melt near 4°C. Oh, wait, perhaps it's mercury? No, mercury's melting point is -39°C. Alternatively, maybe it's a different element. Wait, another idea: perhaps B is solid CO2, but that's dry ice, which sublimates at -78°C. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is a different substance. Let me think about the initial reaction again.

So, X reacts with Y (a liquid) to produce gas W (maybe CO2), precipitate G.

If G is a carbonate, perhaps not. Alternatively, if G is a sulfate, maybe? Suppose X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl. Then the reaction would produce NaCl, CO2, and H2O. But HCl is a liquid, and the reaction would produce NaCl (which is soluble, so no precipitate). Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps Y is not HCl but another acid.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. Wait, but Y is a liquid. Maybe Y is a strong base like NaOH. If X is CO2, then perhaps, but that doesn't fit because X would be a gas. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe X is a metal, and Y is water. If X is a metal that reacts violently with water, like sodium or potassium. The reaction would produce H2 gas. So W would be H2. But earlier, we saw that H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, which doesn't fit the condition of same number. So that can't be.

Wait, but the problem says that the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So for W, the sum of all protons in the molecule equals the sum of all neutrons.

If W is CO2, then 22 each. So that works. So maybe that's the right track.

So, the reaction is between X (maybe a carbonate) and Y (maybe H2SO4). The reaction produces CO2 gas, a sulfate (if the carbonate is of a metal that forms a sulfate which is insoluble, leading to a precipitate G). Then, heating G gives B. Let's say G is a metal sulfate, but when heated, perhaps it decomposes. Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. If Y is H2SO4, the reaction would give CaSO4, CO2, and H2O. If CaSO4 is insoluble, it would precipitate as G. Then, heating G (CaSO4) doesn't release anything, but that's not helpful. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a different acid. Let's think: if X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble hydroxide. For example, if Y is HCl, and X is CaCO3. The reaction would produce CaCl2, CO2, and H2O. If CaCl2 is soluble, then no precipitate forms. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Y is a solution of a hydroxide. Let's say Y is a dilute solution of NaOH. If X is something that reacts with OH- to produce CO2, like a carbonate. Then, the reaction would be X (a carbonate) + H2O → CO2 + a salt (maybe a sodium salt of a carbonate). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3. Reacting with an acid like H2SO4 would produce CO2, Na2SO4, and H2O. If Na2SO4 is soluble, no precipitate. Hmm. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal sulfite. Reacting with an acid could produce SO2 gas, but then W would be SO2. Let's check: SO2 has 16 protons (S=16, O=8 each, two O's). Neutrons: S has 16-16=0? Wait, no, S's atomic number is 16, so number of protons is 16. Neutrons in SO2: S has 16-16=0? No, wait, Sulfur has an atomic number of 16, so it has 16 protons. The most common isotope is S-32, which has 16 neutrons. So each SO2 molecule would have 16 (S) + 2*8 (O) = 32 protons. Neutrons: 16 (S) + 2*8 (O) =32. So that would fit, as protons and neutrons are equal. So W is SO2.

But then, how does that fit into the reaction? If X is a sulfite, reacting with an acid would produce SO2 gas. So perhaps X is Na2SO3. Reacting with HCl (liquid Y) would produce NaCl, SO2, and H2O. If NaCl is soluble, no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So, the product is a molecule with 2 O's.

If X is a reducing agent, perhaps it reduces the keto acid. For example, a keto acid like acetoacetic acid (which has 3 O's in the acid part) could be reduced to a diol, which would have 2 O's (as hydroxyl groups). So X is a reducing agent, like NaBH4, which is used in organic chemistry.

So, if X is NaBH4, let's see:

NaBH4 has Na (23), B (11?), H (1). Wait, but the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is not NaBH4, but something like LiAlH4? No, because LiAlH4 is not as commonly used as NaBH4, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: if X is something like D2O (deuterium oxide), which is a heavier isotope of H2O. But I'm not sure how that would fit into the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the elements involved.

If X is NaBH4, then the elements in X are Na, B, H. The isotopes: H can be H or D. So, if X is NaBD4 (but that doesn't make sense, as boron doesn't have four H's). Alternatively, perhaps X is something else, like K or another metal with an isotope.

Wait, another angle: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, identify the elements in X, find their lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their atomic masses.

If X is NaBH4, elements are Na, B, H. Lightest isotopes: Na (23), B (11?), H (1). Heaviest isotopes: Na (the heaviest isotope would be Na-25?), but wait, Na has isotopes up to Na-25. B's heaviest isotope is B-10. H's heaviest isotope is D (2).

Wait, but in X, which is NaBH4, the elements present are Na, B, and H. So, the lightest elements would be H (1) and maybe B (11). Wait, no, H is lighter than B. So the lightest element is H, and the heaviest is Na (23). So the cumulative masses would be 1 (H) + 23 (Na) = 24. But that's not one of the options. So that can't be.

Another option: X is something with elements C and O. For example, if X is CO2, but that's a gas, and the problem says X is a substance reacting with liquid Y. So perhaps X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3.

In Na2CO3, elements are Na, C, O.

Lightest element is C (12) or O (16? No, wait, Na is 23, C is 12, O is 16. So the lightest would be C (12), the heaviest Na (23). So sum would be 12 +23=35. Which is option A.

But wait, let me check if that fits the other parts.

If X is Na2CO3, and Y is H2SO4 (liquid), the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this reaction, CO2 is gas W (which fits the earlier condition), and Na2SO4 is the precipitate G if it's insoluble. Wait, but Na2SO4 is soluble in water, so no precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem.

So maybe Y is a different acid. Let's say Y is HCl. Then the reaction would produce NaCl, which is also soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is not an acid but something else. Let's think. Maybe Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2. Then, reacting with Na2CO3 would produce BaCO3 precipitate, CO2 gas, and NaNO3. So in this case, G would be BaCO3. Heating BaCO3 would decompose into BaO and CO2. So B would be BaO. What's the melting point of BaO? I'm not sure, but it's around 2223°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Another angle: the product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. If X is something that acts as a reducing agent to convert a keto acid (like a diketone) into an alcohol with fewer oxygen atoms. So, for example, if the keto acid has three oxygen atoms, and X reduces it to a diol with two -OH groups, that would account for two oxygen atoms. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, and when it reacts with the keto acid, it reduces a carbonyl group. For example, if X is Fe, which can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product would have an -OH group, adding an oxygen. But I'm not sure if that would sum to two oxygen atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else, like a borohydride, which would donate H- ions, reducing the keto acid.

Wait, but if X is NaBH4, and it's reacting with a keto acid, perhaps it converts the carbonyl group into an alcohol, thus adding hydrogen and keeping the oxygen count similar. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another approach: think about the possible options. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Earlier, when I thought X was Na2CO3, sum was 35 (C and Na), which is option A.

But I'm not sure if that fits all conditions.

Wait, let's consider another possibility: X is a heavier isotope of hydrogen, like D2O. So, X is D2O, which is a heavier isotope of H2O. Then, the elements present are D (isotope of H) and O.

So, elements in X are H and O. The lightest isotope of H is H (mass 1), and the heaviest would be O's heaviest, say O-18 (mass 18). So sum is 1 + 18 = 19. Not in the options.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps X is something like H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), which has O and H. But H2O2 doesn't fit the reaction as described because reacting it with a liquid may not produce CO2.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal oxide. Let's say X is FeO. Reacting with Y (maybe H2SO4) would produce FeSO4, water, and perhaps some gas. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is copper sulfate, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Another angle: the melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is 4°C. What substance has a melting point near that? Maybe something like a simple hydrocarbon, but they're usually solid at room temperature. Alternatively, perhaps it's a salt that forms a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a melting point around 277 K? I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe B is a hydrate that loses water upon heating, but I'm not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think: if G is a carbonate, heating it could produce CO2 and the metal oxide. For example, heating Na2CO3 gives Na2O and CO2. The melting point of Na2O is around 1360°C, which is way higher. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should focus on the cumulative atomic mass part.

If X is Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O.

Lightest element: C (12) or H? Wait, no, Na2CO3 doesn't have H. So the lightest is C (12), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 12 +23=35, which is option A.

But earlier I thought that when Na2CO3 reacts with H2SO4, it produces Na2SO4, which is soluble, so no precipitate. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps Y is not H2SO4 but another acid, like HCl, and X is a different carbonate. For example, if X is CaCO3, and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce CaCl2, CO2, and H2O. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, but if Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide that reacts with X to produce a precipitate. Let's say Y is Ba(OH)2, a liquid. If X is CO2, which is a gas, it wouldn't fit because X is a solid in the problem. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is not a carbonate but another compound. Let me think again.

Wait, if X is a metal, and Y is water, which is a liquid. But when metals react with water, they produce H2 gas. But earlier, we saw that H2 doesn't fit the condition for gas W. So that's a problem.

Wait, what about if gas W is O2? Then X could be a metal that reacts with Y (maybe a dilute acid) to produce O2. But how would a metal reaction produce O2? That doesn't make sense. Metals typically don't produce O2 when reacting with acids; they produce H2.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is between a peroxide and an acid. For example, H2O2 reacts with H2SO4 to produce O2. Let me check the reaction:

H2O2 + H2SO4 → H2O + O2↑ + SO4^2- ?

Wait, not sure about the stoichiometry, but the reaction could produce O2. Let's see: H2O2 would have 2 H and 2 O. H2SO4 has 2 H, 1 S, 4 O. The products would be H2O, O2, and maybe SO4^2-.

In this case, gas W is O2, which has 16 protons (each O has 8, two O's) and 16 neutrons (each O is O-16, 8 neutrons each). So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that fits.

So if X is H2O2, Y is H2SO4, the reaction produces O2 gas, and perhaps a precipitate. But H2O2 and H2SO4 reacting might not produce a precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps X is another peroxide.

Wait, but the problem says X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So if X is H2O2, then the heavier isotope would be D2O2, which is less common.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide like Na2O2. Let's see:

Na2O2 (sodium peroxide) reacts with H2SO4 (liquid Y). The reaction would be:

Na2O2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + O2↑ + H2O.

In this reaction, O2 is released as gas W, which fits the condition (each O has 8p and 8n, so two O's give 16p and 16n, same).

The precipitate G would be Na2SO4. But Na2SO4 is soluble in water, so that wouldn't form a precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, if Y is another solution that reacts with Na2O2 to form an insoluble sulfate, but I can't think of such a case right now.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction forms a precipitate of a metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2, and X is Na2CO3. The reaction would give BaCO3 precipitate, CO2 gas, and NaNO3. Then, when BaCO3 is heated, it decomposes into BaO and CO2. BaO has a melting point of around 2223°C, which doesn't fit the 277 K (4°C) melting point of B.

Hmm.

Let me think about the melting point again. 277 K is about 4°C. What solid melts at that temperature? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? Wait, ammonium nitrate has a melting point of around 169°C, so that's not it. Alternatively, maybe something like paraffin wax, but that's more like 45-60°C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is solid CO2 (dry ice), which sublimes at -78°C. That's much lower than 277 K, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different form of water. For example, ice melts at 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is 4°C, which is just a bit higher. So perhaps B is a different crystalline form of ice that melts slightly higher. Or maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid with a melting point just above 0°C. Maybe a simple hydrocarbon like naphthalene? No, that's higher.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound, and I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should focus more on the elements in X.

If the cumulative atomic masses are to be considered, perhaps X contains two elements: say, C and O. So the lightest would be C (12), the heaviest O (16). Sum is 12+16=28, which is close to option D (29) but not quite.

Alternatively, if X is CO, then elements are C and O. Sum is 12+16=28 again.

Wait, another angle: maybe X is a diatomic molecule like O2, but that doesn't fit the reaction conditions. Or perhaps X is ozone, O3, but again, probably not.

Wait, if X is a heavier isotope of hydrogen, like deuterium oxide (D2O), which is a heavier isotope of H2O. Then, the elements are D (which is H) and O. So lightest element is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, which isn't an option.

Hmm, this is getting a bit frustrating. Let me try to think differently.

The product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So, perhaps X is something that removes oxygen. For example, if the keto acid has a ketone group (O) and a carboxylic acid group (another O), and X removes the ketone O, making an alcohol with two O's. So, maybe X is a reducing agent like NaBH4, which would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. So, the product would have two O's from the alcohol group and the carboxylic acid.

Wait, for example, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH), which has three O's in the acid (two from carboxylic acid and one from ketone). When reduced by X (like NaBH4), the ketone becomes an alcohol (CH3CH(OH)CH2COOH), which has two O's (from the alcohol and the carboxylic acid). So the product has two O's, perhaps?

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact count. Alternatively, maybe the product has two oxygen atoms, meaning that the product is something with only two O's, like an ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol with one O (the -OH group) plus another O elsewhere. Hmm.

If X is NaBH4, then the elements present are Na, B, H. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is B (11?) or Na (23). Wait, Na is heavier than B. So sum would be 1 (H) + 23 (Na) = 24. That's not an option.

Hmm, but the options don't have 24. So maybe that's not correct.

Wait, another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So for each element in X, we take the lightest isotope and the heaviest isotope, sum their masses.

If X is Na2CO3, elements are Na, C, O.

Na's lightest isotope is Na-23 (23), heaviest is Na-25 (25).

C's lightest is C-12 (12), heaviest is C-14 (14).

O's lightest is O-16 (16), heaviest is O-18 (18).

So for each element in X, sum the lightest and heaviest.

For Na: 23 (lightest) + 25 (heaviest) = 48.

For C: 12 +14 =26.

For O:16 +18=34.

But the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So I think it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, not each element's isotopes.

Wait, that's a different interpretation. So, in X, identify all the elements present. Then, find the lightest element (by atomic number) and the heaviest element (by atomic number), and sum their atomic masses.

So, for example, if X is Na2CO3, elements are Na (23), C (12), O (16). Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 12 +23=35. Which is option A.

But earlier, the reaction between Na2CO3 and H2SO4 doesn't produce a precipitate because Na2SO4 is soluble, which contradicts the problem statement. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else, like CaCO3. Then elements are Ca (40), C (12), O (16). Lightest element C (12), heaviest Ca (40). Sum is 52, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps X contains two elements: say, C and O. Then, lightest is C (12), heaviest O (16). Sum is 28. Not an option.

Another possibility: X contains H and O. Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is D2O, which is a heavier isotope of H2O. So elements are H (lightest) and O (heaviest). Sum is 1 + 16 =17. Not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a metal, like iron. If X is Fe, then the elements are Fe. But that's only one element, so sum is zero? No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with two elements. For example, CH3CH2OH (ethanol). Elements are C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum is 13. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, maybe the product is a molecule with two O's. For example, if the keto acid is something like glyoxylic acid (OOCCOOH?), which upon reaction with X gives a product with two O's. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something that adds two O's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2, but that doesn't fit with the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate of a heavier metal that forms an insoluble sulfate, leading to a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps X is Ag2CO3. Reacting with H2SO4 would produce Ag2SO4, CO2, and H2O. Ag2SO4 is soluble in water, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is PbCO3. Reacting with H2SO4 would produce PbSO4, which is insoluble, leading to precipitate G. Then, heating PbSO4 would produce PbO and SO2. But PbO's melting point is around 880°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to make a table of possible X candidates and their cumulative atomic masses.

Option A:35.

Possible X: Na2CO3. Sum C (12) + Na (23) =35.

Option C:31.

Possible X: maybe a compound with elements like O and N. Or perhaps something else.

Option D:29. Could be sum of C (12) + O (16) + something else? No, 12 +16=28. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if X is CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's a liquid. But the question says X is a substance that reacts violently with Y (liquid). Acetic acid reacting with something might not fit.

Wait, perhaps X is something like H2O2. Let's see: if X is H2O2, elements are H and O. Sum of lightest (H, 1) and heaviest (O,16) is 17. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, like Mg, which reacts with Y (water) to produce H2 gas. But earlier, H2 doesn't fit the condition for W.

Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the initial assumption that X is Na2CO3, leading to a sum of 35 (option A), even though the reaction seems to have some inconsistencies.

Another point: the problem says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Na2CO3 isn't a common reagent; NaHCO3 is sometimes used, but more common is NaBH4.

Wait, NaBH4 is a reagent used in organic chemistry. Let's think about that.

NaBH4 (sodium borohydride) has elements Na, B, H. If X is NaBH4, then the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 1+23=24. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is LiAlH4, which is another reducing agent. Elements are Li, Al, H. Lightest H (1), heaviest Al (27). Sum 28. Not an option.

Hmm. Wait, another thought: maybe X is a compound with elements C and O. For example, CO.

If X is CO, then the elements are C and O. Lightest C (12), heaviest O (16). Sum 28. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CO2, but that's a gas and doesn't fit the reaction as Y is a liquid.

Wait, going back to the reaction: X reacts with Y, a liquid, to produce gas W, precipitate G, which on heating gives B with melting point close to 277 K.

If B's melting point is 277 K, which is 4°C, perhaps B is a solid with a low melting point, like a simple alcohol or something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different form of water, but I can't think of any.

Wait, perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a melting point around 277 K? I'm not sure, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something like ammonium chloride. Wait, the melting point of NH4Cl is around 337 K (64°C), which is higher than 277 K.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options and the information I have.

If I consider that X is Na2CO3, then the sum is 35 (option A). But I'm not entirely confident about the reaction pathway.

Another option: if X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble sulfate. For example, BaCO3. Then, reacting with H2SO4 would produce BaSO4 (insoluble), CO2, and H2O. So G would be BaSO4. Heating BaSO4 wouldn't decompose; it's stable. So B would be BaSO4, but its melting point is much higher than 277 K.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Maybe X is something like H2O, which when reacting with a keto acid, adds an -OH group, reducing the number of oxygen atoms. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reduces the keto acid, adding hydrogen and reducing the oxygen count. For example, if the keto acid has 3 O's, and X reduces it to a diol with 2 O's.

But I'm not making progress on that front.

In the interest of time, I'll have to go with the initial thought that X is Na2CO3, leading to a sum of 35. So the answer would be option A.


The problem involves identifying a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. X reacts violently with a liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases a compound B with a melting point very close to 277 K (approximately 4°C). Additionally, the product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. CO₂ was identified as a candidate because it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in total. This suggests that W is likely CO₂.

2. **Reaction Between X and Y**: If X is a carbonate (e.g., Na₂CO₃) and Y is an acid (e.g., H₂SO₄), the reaction produces CO₂ gas, water, and a precipitate G (e.g., Na₂SO₄ if it is insoluble). However, Na₂SO₄ is soluble, so this does not fit. Other acids like HCl were considered, but they also did not produce a precipitate.

3. **Melting Point of B**: B has a melting point close to 277 K (4°C). This suggests B could be a solid compound with a low melting point, possibly a hydrate or a simple compound.

4. **Keto Acid Reaction**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies X acts as a reducing agent, such as NaBH₄, which reduces keto acids to alcohols. However, NaBH₄ does not fit the isotope condition described in the problem.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: If X is Na₂CO₃, the elements present are Na, C, and O. The lightest element is carbon (C, atomic mass 12), and the heaviest is sodium (Na, atomic mass 23). The cumulative atomic mass is 12 + 23 = 35, which matches option A.

6. **Consistency Check**: While the reaction pathway involving Na₂CO₃ and H₂SO₄ does not produce a precipitate (as Na₂SO₄ is soluble), this issue is overlooked in favor of the isotope condition and the cumulative atomic mass calculation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible candidate for X is Na₂CO₃, leading to a cumulative atomic mass of 35 for the lightest and heaviest elements in X.
