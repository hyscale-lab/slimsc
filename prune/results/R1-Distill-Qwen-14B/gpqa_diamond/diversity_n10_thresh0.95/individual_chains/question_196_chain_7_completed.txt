Okay, I need to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about harmonic oscillators. In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this question is about a relativistic case, so that's different.

In relativity, energy isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential; it's more complicated because of the rest mass energy. The total energy E of a particle in special relativity is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the kinetic energy (K) is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, which is gamma m c².

At maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Wait, no, that's not right. In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum when the mass is at the extremes (x=A), and the kinetic energy is zero there. But when the mass passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential energy is zero. So, in the classical case, the maximum speed happens when all potential is converted to kinetic, but relativistically, this conversion isn't as straightforward.

Wait, but in the relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy is E = (1/2)k x² + (gamma m c² - m c²) = gamma m c².

Wait, but at maximum speed, how does this energy relate? Hmm, perhaps I should consider the point where the kinetic energy is maximum. That would be when the potential energy is zero, i.e., when x=0. So, then E = gamma m c², and since E is the sum of kinetic and potential, but at x=0, potential is zero. So E equals kinetic energy. Hmm, but wait, in the classical oscillator, the total energy is (1/2)k A², right? So in the relativistic case, the total energy would still be the same, because energy must be conserved. So E = (1/2)k A².

But wait, does that hold? Because in relativity, the total energy could be different because of the rest mass energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law. So, perhaps the potential is (1/2)k x², same as classical. But the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So, the total energy of the oscillator would be E = (1/2)k A² + m c² (rest energy) + K.E. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)k A², which is equal to the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So in the relativistic case, perhaps the total energy E is (1/2)k A² + rest energy m c²? Or is it different?

Wait, perhaps the total energy E includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic and potential. So E = m c² + (1/2)k x² + K.E., but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², because K.E. = (gamma - 1) m c².

But in the classical case, E is (1/2)k A², and the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)k A². So in the relativistic case, the total energy E would be (1/2)k A² plus the rest mass energy, because when x is maximum, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero (so E = m c² + (1/2)k A²). Wait, no, that can't be right because in the classical case, E is (1/2)k A², but in the relativistic case, at maximum displacement, the total energy would be m c² plus the potential energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, maybe the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case is E = (1/2)k A², same as the classical case, but then the rest energy is part of that. So, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), its potential energy is (1/2)k A², and its kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)k A² = m c² + 0. Wait, but that would imply that (1/2)k A² is equal to m c², which would not make sense because in the classical case, the maximum speed is sqrt(kA²/m), which would be v_max = c sqrt(k A²/(m c²)) )? Wait, maybe not. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy in the relativistic oscillator is E = (1/2)k A² + m c². Because when the oscillator is at x=A, potential is maximum, and kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)k A² + m c².

Wait, but in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)k A², but that's without considering the rest mass energy. So perhaps in relativity, the total energy includes both the rest mass and the potential energy. Hmm, perhaps that makes sense.

So, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, so E = (gamma -1 ) m c² + m c², which is gamma m c². So, setting E = (1/2)k A² + m c² = gamma m c².

Wait, that seems better. So, at x=0, the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So, the total energy is (gamma -1) m c² + (1/2)k x² (which is zero at x=0). So E = (gamma - 1) m c² + 0 = gamma m c².

But when x=A, the potential is (1/2)k A², and kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)k A² + 0 = (1/2)k A².

So, the total energy must be the same in both cases. So, at x=A, E = (1/2)k A², and at x=0, E = gamma m c². Therefore, (1/2)k A² = gamma m c².

Wait, but that can't be right because gamma is greater than or equal to 1, so (1/2)k A² would be larger than m c², which might not always be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that E is the sum of kinetic and potential energies, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c^2, and the potential is (1/2) k x^2.

So, E = (1/2)k x² + (gamma -1) m c².

At x=0, the potential is zero, so E = (gamma -1) m c² = K.E. At x=A, E = (1/2)k A² + 0 = (1/2)k A².

So, the total energy E must be the same in both situations. Therefore, (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

But wait, that would imply:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

But gamma is a function of velocity. So, at x=0, the velocity is maximum, which is the v_max we're trying to find.

So, at x=0, v is maximum, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²).

So, (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

Substitute gamma:

(1/2)k A² = ( (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) * m c².

Let me write that equation again:

(1/2)k A² = m c² [ (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) - 1 ].

Let me let u = v^2 / c^2, so u is dimensionless.

Then,

(1/2)k A² = m c² [ (1 / sqrt(1 - u) ) - 1 ].

Divide both sides by m c²:

( k A² ) / (2 m c² ) = [ (1 / sqrt(1 - u) ) - 1 ].

Let me call the left-hand side as K, so K = [1/(2 m c²)] * k A².

So,

K = [ 1/sqrt(1 - u) - 1 ]

Let me rearrange:

1/sqrt(1 - u) = K + 1.

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - u) = 1/(K + 1).

Square both sides:

1 - u = 1/(K + 1)^2.

So,

u = 1 - [1/(K + 1)^2 ].

Substitute back K = (k A²)/(2 m c²):

u = 1 - [1/( (k A²/(2 m c²)) + 1 )^2 ].

But u is v²/c², so:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/( (k A²/(2 m c²)) + 1 )^2 ]

Let me compute the denominator inside the 1/(...) term.

The term in the denominator is (k A²/(2 m c²) + 1 ) = [ (k A² + 2 m c² )/(2 m c²) ) ].

So,

( ... )^2 = [ (k A² + 2 m c² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

So,

1/( [...] ) becomes (2 m c²)^2 / (k A² + 2 m c²)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ (2 m c²)^2 / (k A² + 2 m c²)^2 ) ].

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me see if I can simplify it.

Let me compute (k A² + 2 m c²)^2 = (k A²)^2 + 4 m c² (k A²) + (2 m c²)^2.

But perhaps it's better to factor 2 m c² from the numerator and denominator.

Wait, (k A² + 2 m c²) = 2 m c² ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 1 ). Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as B, so B = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

(k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) = 2 m c² (B +1 )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/( (B + 1 )^2 ) ].

Because, the term inside is (B +1 )^2.

Wait, wait, earlier substitution:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/( (B +1 )^2 ) ].

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/( (B +1 )^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ ( (B+1)^2 - 1 ) / (B+1)^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ (B² + 2B +1 -1 ) / (B+1)^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ (B² + 2B ) / (B+1)^2 ) ]

Factor numerator:

B(B +2 )

Denominator is (B+1)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ B (B + 2 ) ] / (B + 1 )^2.

But B = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

B + 2 = (k A²)/(2 m c² ) + 2.

Hmm, perhaps we can write v in terms of B.

Wait, this seems a bit involved. Let's go back to the equation:

(1/2)k A² = m c² (gamma - 1 )

We can solve for gamma:

gamma = ( (1/2)k A^2 )/(m c²) ) + 1.

gamma = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ] + 1.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (k A^2)/(2 m c²) + 1.

Let me make this substitution:

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c²) as Q. So, Q = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = Q + 1.

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(Q +1 )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/( ( Q +1 )^2 )

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/( ( Q +1 )^2 )

= [ ( Q +1 )^2 -1 ] / ( Q +1 )^2

= [ (Q^2 + 2 Q +1 ) -1 ] / (Q +1 )^2

= ( Q^2 + 2 Q ) / ( Q +1 )^2

Factor numerator:

= Q ( Q + 2 ) / ( ( Q +1 )^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( Q ( Q + 2 ) ) / ( Q +1 )

But Q is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ), so:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + 2 ] ) / ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + 1 )

Let me compute numerator inside the sqrt:

Let me compute (k A^2/(2 m c² )) * ( (k A^2/(2 m c² )) + 2 )

= [k A^2/(2 m c²)] * [ (k A^2 + 4 m c² )/(2 m c²) ) ]

= [ k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c² ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator in the fraction is:

( (k A^2/(2 m c² )) + 1 ) = [k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ]/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )/(4 m^2 c^4) ] ) ) / ( [k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ]/(2 m c^2 ) )

Simplify numerator inside sqrt:

sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )/(4 m^2 c^4) ) )

= sqrt( [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * [ sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 ) ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

Wait, the denominator is [ (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

So, the division becomes multiplication by reciprocal:

v = c * [ sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 ) ) ] * [ 2 m c^2 / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ) ]

The 2 m c^2 terms cancel:

v = c * sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

Factor k A^2 inside the square root:

sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) = A k sqrt( (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

Wait, perhaps factor out k A^2 from the terms inside the sqrt:

Wait, k A^2 +4 m c^2 = k A^2 (1 + (4 m c^2)/(k A^2 )) )

But perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, let me factor k A^2 from the product inside the sqrt:

sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) = sqrt( k A^2 ) * sqrt( k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

= A sqrt(k) * sqrt( k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

Hmm, not sure that helps. Maybe I should take a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, denominator is (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ), numerator inside the sqrt is k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

Wait, let me see if (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) can be written as (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express everything in terms of (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = Q.

Then, Q = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

Numerator inside sqrt: k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 Q) [ (2 m c^2 Q) +4 m c^2 ) ]

= 2 m c^2 Q ( 2 m c^2 ( Q + 2 ) )

= 2 m c^2 Q * 2 m c^2 (Q +2 )

= 4 m^2 c^4 Q (Q +2 )

So, sqrt( that ) is sqrt(4 m^2 c^4 Q (Q +2 )) = 2 m c^2 sqrt( Q (Q +2 ) )

So,

v = c * [ 2 m c^2 sqrt( Q (Q +2 )) ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

But the denominator is (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) = 2 m c^2 (Q +1 )

So,

v = c * [ 2 m c^2 sqrt(Q (Q+2 )) ] / [ 2 m c^2 (Q +1 ) ]

The 2 m c^2 terms cancel:

v = c * sqrt( Q (Q + 2 ) ) / ( Q +1 )

Let me square both sides to make it easier:

v^2 = c^2 [ Q (Q+2) ] / (Q+1)^2.

But Q is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ), so let's substitute back:

v^2 = c^2 [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) + 2 ) ] / [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) +1 )^2 ]

Factor out 1/(2 m c^2 ) from each term:

Inside the first term (Q (Q+2 )):

(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) + 2 ) ]

= k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) [ (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Denominator (Q +1 )^2:

[ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) + 1 ) ]^2 = (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

The denominators (4 m^2 c^4 ) cancel:

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe we can factor the numerator and denominator. Let me factor out terms.

Let me write numerator as:

k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) = k A^2 [ k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ]

Denominator is:

(k A^2 +2 m c^2 )^2 = [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can make substitutions to simplify.

Let me let a = k A^2/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

a = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

k A^2 = 2 m c^2 a.

Substituting into numerator:

k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 a) (2 m c^2 a +4 m c^2 )

= 2 m c^2 a * m c^2 ( 2 a +4 ) 

Wait, 2 m c^2 a +4 m c^2 = 2 m c^2 (a + 2 )

So,

= 2 m c^2 a * 2 m c^2 (a +2 )

= 4 m² c^4 a (a +2 )

Denominator:

(k A^2 +2 m c^2 )^2 = (2 m c^2 a + 2 m c^2 )^2 = [ 2 m c^2 (a +1 ) ]^2 =4 m² c^4 (a +1 )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [4 m² c^4 a (a + 2 ) ] / [4 m² c^4 (a +1 )^2 ].

Simplify:

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ a(a +2 ) ] / (a +1 )^2.

Which is,

v = c * sqrt( a (a +2 ) ) / (a +1 )

But a is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c² )) ( (k A^2/(2 m c² )) + 2 ) ] ) / ( (k A^2/(2 m c² )) +1 )

Hmm. Let me compute the numerator inside the sqrt.

Let me compute (k A^2/(2 m c² )) * ( (k A^2/(2 m c² )) + 2 )

= (k A^2/(2 m c² )) [ (k A^2 + 4 m c² )/(2 m c² ) ]

= [ k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c² ) ]/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is (k A^2/(2 m c² ) +1 ) = (k A^2 + 2 m c² )/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c² ) ]/(4 m² c^4 ) ) / ( (k A^2 + 2 m c² )/(2 m c² ) )

Simplify numerator in sqrt:

= sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (2 m c² )

Denominator becomes [ (k A^2 +2 m c² )/(2 m c² ) ]

So,

v = c * [ sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (2 m c² ) ] * [ 2 m c² )/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ]

The 2 m c^2 terms cancel.

So,

v = c * sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )) / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

Hmm, perhaps factor k A^2 from numerator.

Inside the sqrt, k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) = k A^2 [ k A^2 +4 m c^2 ]

So,

sqrt( k A^2 [ k A^2 +4 m c^2 ] ) = A sqrt( k ) * sqrt( k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

But the denominator is (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

Wait, maybe another substitution.

Let me factor out k A^2 from the terms inside the sqrt:

k A^2 +4 m c^2 = k A^2 [ 1 + (4 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) ]

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor denominator:

k A^2 +2 m c^2 = k A^2 (1 + 2 m c^2/(k A^2 ) )

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as:

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] ) / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

= c * [ A sqrt( k (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) ] / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator in terms of k A^2. Let me see.

Let me denote b = k A^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( b (b +4 m c^2 ) ) / (b +2 m c^2 )

= c * sqrt( [b^2 +4 m c^2 b ] ) / (b +2 m c^2 )

Hmm, maybe factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator is sqrt( b (b +4 m c^2 ) )

Denominator is b + 2 m c^2.

Is there a way to express this fraction?

Let me compute [ b (b +4 m c^2 ) ] = b² +4 m c² b.

Denominator (b +2 m c² )^2 = b² +4 m c² b +4 m² c^4.

Wait, but numerator is b² +4 m c² b, denominator is b² +4 m c² b +4 m² c^4.

So,

v = c * sqrt( b² +4 m c² b ) / (b² +4 m c² b +4 m² c^4 )^(1/2 )

= c * sqrt( [b² +4 m c^2 b ] / [ (b + 2 m c^2 )^2 ] )

= c * sqrt( (b (b +4 m c^2 )) ) / (b +2 m c^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator is b (b +4 m c² )

Denominator is (b + 2 m c^2 )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [b (b +4 m c^2 ) ] ) / (b +2 m c^2 )

Hmm, not seeing a clear simplification. Maybe I can write as:

v = c * sqrt( [ b (b +4 m c^2 ) ] ) / ( (b + 2 m c^2 ) )

But perhaps another approach. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m ))^2 )

Wait, but I think I have an expression for v in terms of (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which is Q.

Wait, perhaps I should express v in terms of Q.

Earlier, we had:

v^2 = c^2 [ Q (Q + 2 ) ] / (Q +1 )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ Q (Q +2 ) ] ) / ( Q +1 )

= c * sqrt( Q^2 + 2 Q ) / ( Q +1 )

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option D:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, but I don't think that's the case because our expression has a sqrt with Q (Q + 2 ) in the numerator.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, let me see. Let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )).

But our expression has something else.

Option A: 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m ))^2.

Hmm, but we have Q = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

Denominator in option A is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2.

Wait, but that would be (1 - (2 m c^2 Q )/( m c^2 ))^2.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think for a moment.

Wait, perhaps I should express v in terms of Q.

v = c * sqrt( Q (Q + 2 ) ) / ( Q +1 )

= c * sqrt( [ Q (Q +2 ) ] ) / (Q +1 )

= c * sqrt( (Q² + 2 Q ) / (Q +1 )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ Q² + 2 Q ] ) / (Q +1 )

Wait, perhaps factor the numerator inside the sqrt.

Wait, Q² +2 Q = Q (Q +2 )

So, yeah, back to same expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

v = c * sqrt( [ Q^2 + 2 Q ] ) / (Q +1 )

= c * sqrt( [ (Q +1 )^2 -1 ] ) / (Q +1 )

= c * sqrt( (Q +1 )^2 -1 ) / (Q +1 )

= c * sqrt( 1 - (1)/(Q +1 )^2 )

Wait, because sqrt( a² - b² ) = a sqrt(1 - (b/a )^2 )

Wait, no, that's only when a > b.

Wait, let me think.

Let me write [Q² + 2 Q ] = (Q +1 )^2 -1.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (Q +1 )^2 - 1 ) / (Q +1 )

= c * sqrt( [ (Q +1 )^2 (1 - 1/(Q +1 )^2 ) ] ) / (Q +1 )

= c * (Q +1 ) * sqrt( 1 - 1/(Q +1 )^2 ) / (Q +1 )

= c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(Q +1 )^2 )

Ah! So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( Q +1 )^2 )

But Q is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ), so Q +1 = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) +1 = [ k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ]/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/(Q +1 )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ]^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [ (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ]^2 )

= c sqrt( 1 - [ 4 m² c^4 ]/(k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 )

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see this exact form.

Wait, looking at option D:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So, 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 is same as 1/(Q +1 )^2, which is the same as [ (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(Q+1 )^2 ] )

Which is same as option D.

Wait, no:

Option D is sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2 ), but the expression I have is sqrt(1 - [ ... ]^2 ), which is option D.

Yes, because 1/(Q +1 )^2 is same as 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Which matches option D.

But wait, let me double-check. Option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ] )

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

But wait, looking back, I had:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(Q +1 )^2 )

Which is the same as option D.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but another option I thought earlier was C, which is the classical solution. But in relativity, the maximum speed is less than c. Let me see.

Wait, when k A^2 is small compared to 2 m c^2, then (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) is small. So, Q is small. Then, 1/(Q +1 )^2 approaches 1.

So,

v ≈ c * sqrt(1 -1 ) =0, which can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, when Q is small.

Wait, let me compute for Q <<1.

Then,

1/(1 + Q )^2 ≈ 1 - 2 Q + 3 Q² - ... 

So,

1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2 Q ) = 2 Q.

So,

v ≈ c * sqrt( 2 Q ) = c * sqrt( 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) )

= sqrt( k A^2/(m) ) * c / c = sqrt( k A^2 / m )

Which is the classical result, option C. So in the limit Q <<1, the relativistic solution reduces to the classical one. So that makes sense.

So, in relativity, the maximum speed is less than or equal to c, which is correct. So option D must be the correct one.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the energy conservation and relativistic dynamics.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and includes both the potential energy \( U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \) and the relativistic kinetic energy \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. Thus, the total energy is:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \gamma m c^2
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   At \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum (\( v = v_{\text{max}} \)), and the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma \) into the energy equation:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \frac{\gamma m c^2}{\gamma - 1}
   \]  
   Rearranging and solving for \( \gamma \), we find:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

3. **Expressing \( v_{\text{max}} \) in terms of \( \gamma \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} \), we substitute \( \gamma \) from the previous step:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides and solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \):  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

4. **Verification with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is consistent with relativistic energy conservation and reduces to the classical result \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \) in the limit where \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \ll 1 \). Thus, the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by **Option D**.
