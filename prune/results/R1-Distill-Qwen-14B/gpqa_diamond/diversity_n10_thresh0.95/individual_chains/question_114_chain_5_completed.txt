Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form a carboxylic acid, specifically 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually through some kind of addition reaction. Wait, wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So NaCN is potassium cyanide? Or is it sodium cyanide? Well, regardless, the starting material is a ketone and the product after adding NaCN and reagent A is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group.

Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when that ketone reacts with sodium cyanide, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh, right! The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile. But wait, ketones don't typically react with cyanide in a straightforward way. Wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, under certain conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the product would add the CN- nucleophile to the carbonyl carbon, along with the hydroxyl group. So the product would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which matches the given product.

But what's reagent A in this case? Because I think that forming a cyanohydrin usually requires an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the attack of the cyanide ion on the protonated carbonyl carbon. So the ketone's carbonyl is protonated, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks. So the reagent A should be an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, H3O+ is a possibility.

Wait, but then in the reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ would form the cyanohydrin. So that's the first reaction. So for part A, the reagent is H3O+ or maybe something else. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Option B has A as H3O+ and B as CH3COOH. Option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. Option D has A as NaHSO3 and B as CH3COOH.

Wait, but what about the second reaction? The second reactant is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. It's a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. And it's reacting with B (H2O) to form a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid.

How do you oxidize a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I think that generally, nitriles can be oxidized using strong oxidizing agents. But under certain conditions, maybe with water as a solvent and an acid catalyst.

Wait, another thought: The nitrile group is adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the nitrile is converted to an amide first, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, hydrolysis of nitriles can produce different products depending on the conditions. Under acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids, right? Or maybe under basic conditions they go to amines.

Wait, but in this case, the nitrile is in a molecule that already has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So it's 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when this is treated with H2O and reagent B, which is an acid, perhaps.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The second step: the nitrile group is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So the starting material is a nitrile (R-CN) and the product is R-COOH. So the nitrile is oxidized to a carboxylic acid.

What's the typical reagent for that? I think in some cases, strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions can oxidize nitriles to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under certain conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, especially if they have a good leaving group.

Wait, but in the given case, the nitrile is attached to a carbon that's also bearing a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile group. Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis usually requires specific conditions.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides under basic conditions, and to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions. So if we have a nitrile and we add water with an acid, maybe HCl or H3O+, it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So in the second reaction, reagent B is H2O and the other part is an acid. So the reagent B is HCl, or another acid.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is labeled as B and H2O is the solvent? Or is B the reagent added along with H2O?

Ah, the question says: reagent B is H2O. Wait no, the way it's written is that the second reaction is with B, and H2O is the solvent. Because the reaction is written as: ... + B (H2O) ---> ... So H2O is the solvent, and B is the reagent.

Ah, so for the second reaction, the reagent is B, and the solvent is water. So what reagent B would cause the nitrile to turn into a carboxylic acid in water.

Wait, I think it's about the hydrolysis of the nitrile. So if the nitrile is in a position where it can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions, perhaps the reagent is a strong acid like HCl.

Wait, another approach: Looking at the options, reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So which of these would promote the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

HCl is a strong acid, which would protonate the nitrile's lone pair, making it more electrophilic. Then, water could attack, leading to hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe using HCl as the acid catalyst in the hydrolysis.

So in the second reaction, reagent B is HCl, which would provide the acidic conditions needed for the nitrile to hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

Now, going back to the first reaction. Reagent A is needed for the formation of the cyanohydrin from the ketone. As I thought earlier, the reagent is an acid, like H3O+.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+, and for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → This fits.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → For second reaction, using acetic acid as the reagent. Would that be enough? I'm not sure. HCl is a stronger acid, maybe needed for the hydrolysis.

So option A seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. The first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid catalyst, which makes sense. The second reaction uses HCl as the reagent, providing the acidic conditions necessary for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

So the correct options would be A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Which is option A.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. Acidic conditions are typically required for this reaction, as the protonation of the carbonyl carbon enhances its electrophilicity. Therefore, reagent A is likely H₃O⁺, a strong acid catalyst.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires acidic conditions, and HCl is a suitable reagent for this purpose, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the reaction to proceed.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is a weaker acid and less suitable for the second reaction compared to HCl.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not appropriate for the first reaction, as it is not an acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
