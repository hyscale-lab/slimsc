Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both are high-resolution spectrographs, but their detection limits are different. The question gives me specific info about their magnitude thresholds.

Let me read the question again. It says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, any star with V magnitude <=17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag <=16. So a star needs to be bright enough for both, but wait, actually, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So each star's apparent V magnitude needs to be below 17 for ESPRESSO and below 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Because if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can't see it? Or is it that the brighter the star, the easier it is to detect.

Wait, wait. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh, wait, no, wait. Magnitude is a counterintuitive scale. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star has V magnitude of 17, that's quite faint. So ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So any star with V mag <=17 is observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So V mag <=16. So a star must have V mag <=17 to be seen by ESPRESSO and also V mag <=16 to be seen by HIRES. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=16, because if it's higher than 16, it can't be seen by HIRES. But wait, no, if it's brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, meaning <=17, but for HIRES, brighter than 16, which is <=16. So the star must have V mag <=16 to be detected by both. Because if it's between 16 and 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't. So the star's apparent V mag should be <=16 to be detected by both.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So the star's apparent magnitude must be within the observable range of both. So for ESPRESSO, V mag <=17. For HIRES, V mag <=16. So the star's V mag must be <=16, because that's the stricter limit.

So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude. Wait, but some stars are given with absolute magnitude and distance, so I need to compute their apparent magnitude.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. Apparent magnitude m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, so log(10/10)=0. So m = 15.5 + 0 =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Which is <=16, so it's detectable by both. Because 15.5 is less than 16 and 17. So ESPRESSO can see it, HIRES can see it.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So that's above 16. So HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, because 16.5 <=17. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5 mag, but wait, no, wait. Wait, Star3's data shows apparent V mag of 15.5. But wait, that's without considering interstellar extinction. Because there's E(B-V) = 0.6 mag. And the note says that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So extinction, which makes the star appear fainter. So I have to correct the apparent magnitude for extinction.

Wait, the formula for extinction A_V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = about 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_true + A_V. Because extinction makes it appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So Star3's apparent magnitude would be 15.5 + 1.86 = about 17.36 mag. So that's higher than 17, so ESPRESSO can't observe it. So Star3's observed V mag is 17.36, which is above ESPRESSO's limit (brighter than 17 is for ESPRESSO? Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Wait, wait. Wait, the question says that for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, if a star's V mag is <=17, it can be observed. Because 17 is the limit. So if a star's apparent V mag is 17.36, which is fainter than 17 mag, so it's beyond the detection limit for ESPRESSO. So Star3 is too faint for ESPRESSO. But what about HIRES? HIRES can only go down to 16 mag. So for HIRES, Star3's m is 17.36, which is way beyond 16, so HIRES can't see it either. So Star3 can't be detected by either? Or wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Star3 has an apparent V mag of 15.5, but with extinction of 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent V mag would be 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. So that's m=17.36. So for ESPRESSO, which can observe m <=17. So 17.36 is fainter than 17; ESPRESSO can't see it. For HIRES, which can observe m <=16, 17.36 is way beyond, so it can't see it. So Star3 can't be detected by either, so it's not an option.

Star4: absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc, same as Star1. So apparent mag without extinction is 15.5. But E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24 mag. So the observed m is 15.5 +1.24=16.74 mag. So for ESPRESSO, m must be <=17, which it is (16.74 <17). So ESPRESSO can detect. For HIRES, m must be <=16. So 16.74 >16. So HIRES can't detect. So Star4 can be observed by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star5: absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. So compute apparent mag. m = M +5 log10(d/10) = 16.5 +5 log10(5/10)=16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505≈15.0 mag. So apparent V is 15.0. No E(B-V) given, so no extinction. So m=15.0. Which is <=16 and <=17. So both can detect it.

So let's summarize:

Star1: m=15.5. Both can see it.

Star2: m=16.5. HIRES no, ESPRESSO yes.

Star3: m=17.36. Neither.

Star4: m=16.74. ESPRESSO yes, HIRES no.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can see.

Wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So looking at the stars, Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both. Let me check.

Wait Star1: m=15.5. Both can detect. Star5: m=15.0. Both can detect. So which options include these? Let me look at the options.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't; Star5 can.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't, Star5 can.

C) Star2 and Star3 → both can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can, Star4 can't.

Wait, so the correct pair is Star1 and Star5. But wait, looking at the options, is that an option? Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → no, because Star4 can't.

B) Star3 and Star5 → no, Star3 can't.

C) Star2 and Star3 → no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → no, because Star4 can't.

Wait, so none of the options have Star1 and Star5. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated something.

Let me check each star again.

Star1: m=15.5. So both can detect.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can detect.

So which option includes both? Let me look.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m is 16.74. So HIRES can't. So A includes Star4 and Star5. But Star4's m is 16.74, which is higher than 16, so HIRES can't see it. So A would have Star5 (yes) and Star4 (no). So A can't be correct.

Option D: Star1 and Star4: Star1 can, Star4 can't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance calculation.

Wait, Star5: Absolute mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

m = M +5 log10(d/10)

d=5, so d/10=0.5 → log(0.5)= -0.3010.

5 * (-0.3010) = -1.505.

So m=16.5 + (-1.505) =15.0 mag.

So yes, m=15.0. So both can detect.

Then, looking back at the options, none list Star1 and Star5. What's the options again?

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4: m=16.74 (beyond HIRES limit). So A's stars are Star4 (no) and Star5 (yes). So only one.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3's m=17.36, so no. Star5 yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → both no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 yes, Star4 no.

Wait, none of the options have both Star1 and Star5. But perhaps I have a mistake in assessing the observable magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the apparent magnitude must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So, the observable for ESPRESSO is V mag <17, since brighter than 17 is the limit. So for ESPRESSO, V mag must be less than 17. Similarly, HIRES requires V mag less than 16.

So for both, the star's V mag must be less than 16.

So Star1: 15.5 <16 → yes for both.

Star4: 16.74 >16 → no for HIRES, yes for ESPRESSO.

Star5:15.0 <16 → yes for both.

So which stars are detectable by both? Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options:

Which option includes both Star1 and Star5?

Looking at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star5 is correct, but Star4 isn't.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't.

C) Star2 and Star3 → no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

Hmm, none of the options include both Star1 and Star5. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star3.

Wait, Star3's apparent V mag is given as 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=1.86. So m_total =15.5 +1.86=17.36. Which is above 17, so ESPRESSO can't see it.

Wait, but Star3's position is RA=11h DEC=48 deg. Hmm, but the question says to disregard the pointing limits, so that's not a factor.

What about Star4? 16.74, which is above 16, so HIRES can't see it.

Wait, but the options don't have Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the stars:

Star5: absolute mag is 16.5, distance 5 pc, so m=15.0.

Star1: m=15.5.

So both can be seen by both spectrographs.

Wait, but which options have both?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Let me recheck the options again.

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

Star1: m=15.5 → both can see.

Star4: m=16.74 → HIRES can't.

So option D is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the extinction calculation for Star4.

Star4's parameters: absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So m is 15.5. Extinction E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So yes, Star4's apparent mag is 16.74.

So, only Star1 and Star5 can be seen by both. But the options don't have both in any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star3's calculation.

Wait, Star3: apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's before extinction. Oh, wait, wait. The question states Star3's data as: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. So I think I included extinction correctly.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the apparent V magnitude is given for some stars, and absolute for others. So for Star3, the given apparent magnitude is already the observed (without extinction?) No, I don't think so. Wait, the problem says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance..." Wait no, wait. Let me re-read:

Star3 - RA = 11 h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.

Wait, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but that's the observed magnitude, or the intrinsic? Wait, no, the question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag", so that's the observed magnitude. So Star3's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5. Wait, but the E(B-V) is provided. Wait, that complicates things. Because if the apparent magnitude is already what's observed, including extinction, then the E(B-V) is given, but perhaps we don't need to adjust anything. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the problem says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag", and the E(B-V)=0.6. But if the apparent magnitude is already what's observed (including extinction), then we don't have to correct it. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so the observed apparent magnitude is higher. But if the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, that's what is observed, so it's already including the extinction. So perhaps I was wrong earlier in adding the extinction.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because the apparent magnitude is the observed, which already includes any extinction.

Wait, but the problem statement says: "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So perhaps for Star3, which gives apparent V magnitude (which is m_observed), and gives E(B-V), but perhaps the question is expecting to compute the intrinsic apparent magnitude without extinction?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think.

If a star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, and the absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V), then the extinction in V is 1.86 mag. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (if no extinction) would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64 mag.

Wait, but that would imply that without extinction, the star would be brighter. But that's not how apparent magnitude works. Because extinction makes the star appear fainter, so the observed m is higher. So if the observed m is 15.5, which is after extinction, the intrinsic m (without extinction) would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64.

Wait, but in that case, if the intrinsic m is 13.64, which is brighter than the observed, but what's the point? Because the spectrographs can only observe the observed m.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's re-examine each star:

For each star, the apparent V magnitude is either given or needs to be calculated (using absolute magnitude and distance, plus any extinction).

Star1: absolute V mag=15.5, distance=10pc. So m=15.5. No extinction. So m=15.5. Both can detect.

Star2: apparent V=16.5. No extinction. So m=16.5. HIRES can't, but ESPRESSO can.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=3.1*0.6=1.86. So the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So m=17.36. So for ESPRESSO, 17.36>17 can't be observed. HIRES can't either.

Star4: absolute V=15.5, distance=10pc. So m=15.5. E(B-V)=0.4. A_V=1.24. So observed m=15.5+1.24=16.74. So m=16.74. ESPRESSO can (m<17). HIRES can't (m>16).

Star5: absolute V=16.5, distance=5pc. So m=16.5 + distance modulus. Distance is 5 pc → d/10=0.5 → log(0.5)= -0.301. So 5 * (-0.301)= -1.505. So m=16.5 + (-1.505)=15.0. No extinction. So m=15.0. Both can see.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0).

Looking back at the options, which options include both?

Options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't (m=16.74), so only Star5 is correct.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't, Star5 can.

C) Star2 and Star3 → neither can.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can, Star4 can't.

So none of the options include both Star1 and Star5. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh, I think I misread the options. Let me check.

Options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 (m=16.74, can't), Star5 (m=15.0, can).

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 (m=17.36, can't), Star5 (can).

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 (m=16.5, can't), Star3 (can't).

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 (can), Star4 (can't).

So none of the options include both Star1 and Star5. That's a problem. Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star5. Star5's apparent magnitude calculation.

Star5: absolute V=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Distance modulus is 5 log10(5/10) =5 log(0.5)=5*(-0.301)= -1.505.

So m=16.5 -1.505=15.0 mag. Correct.

So Star5's m is 15.0.

Which would make it detectable by both.

So, the only stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5. But in the options, none have both.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is Star4 and Star5. Star4's m is 16.74, which is above HIRES' limit, so only Star5 is okay. So option A would have only Star5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options. Let me check again.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So, according to my analysis, the correct pair is Star1 and Star5. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake regarding Star4. Let me recheck Star4's m.

Star4: absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So m=15.5. E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=1.24. So m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74. So Star4's m is 16.74.

Which is below ESPRESSO's 17, so ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't because 16.74>16.

So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

So which stars can both detect?

Only Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0). So the correct answer should include both, but none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question. Let me re-read the question.

The question is: Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph and the HIRES spectrograph?

So it's looking for stars that can be seen by both. So the correct pair would be Star1 and Star5.

But looking at the options, perhaps I missed something. Let me check the options again.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing another star. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. Star5: m=15.0. E(B-V)=0? Because the problem says Star5's absolute V is 16.5, distance 5 pc, no E(B-V) given. So no extinction. So that's correct.

So the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have this combination. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question and the options.

Wait, the options may have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which stars can be detected with either, not both. But the question says "with both".

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for Star1.

Star1: absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So m=15.5. No extinction. So m=15.5. So both can see it.

Star5: m=15.0, both can see.

So the correct answer is stars 1 and 5. But the options don't include this.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Star3's m=17.36, can't be detected.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can, Star4 can't.

So none of the options have both Star1 and Star5. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the E(B-V) calculation for Star3 and Star4.

Wait, for Star3: E(B-V)=0.6. A_V=3.1*0.6=1.86. So m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Similarly, Star4: 0.4 → A_V=1.24. m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the apparent magnitude given for Star3 is the extinction-corrected magnitude, and the E(B-V) is provided to calculate the observed magnitude. Wait, no. The problem states that Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and E(B-V)=0.6. So the apparent magnitude is the observed one, which already includes extinction. Therefore, perhaps I should *not* add the extinction again. Because when the apparent magnitude is given, it's after extinction. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is already the observed magnitude. So in that case, Star3's m=15.5.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me rethink.

If the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, that's already the observed, including extinction. So for Star3, no further correction is needed. So m=15.5.

But the problem states that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So perhaps I should correct the apparent magnitude to get the intrinsic brightness.

Wait, but why? If the apparent magnitude is what is observed, then E(B-V) is given, but perhaps we don't need to do anything because the observed m already includes extinction.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me clarify.

In astronomy, the apparent magnitude is what you observe. Extinction makes the star appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So if a star has an E(B-V), the observed apparent magnitude is higher than the intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude.

In the problem, for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So that's the observed, which includes extinction. So we don't need to adjust it. Similarly, for Star4, if the apparent magnitude is computed from absolute (including distance) but without considering extinction, then we have to add the extinction to get the observed m.

Wait, but for Star4, the apparent magnitude is calculated from absolute mag and distance, which doesn't include extinction. So to get the observed m, we have to add the extinction.

But for Star3, the apparent magnitude is already the observed (given), so no correction is needed.

So let me reevaluate:

Star1: m=15.5. No extinction. So m=15.5.

Star2: m=16.5. No extinction. So m=16.5.

Star3: m=15.5. E(B-V)=0.6. But since the apparent magnitude is already observed (includes extinction), perhaps we don't need to adjust. So m=15.5.

Star4: m=15.5 (from absolute and distance). E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=1.24 → observed m=15.5+1.24=16.74.

Star5: m=15.0. No extinction.

So now, reevaluating:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5 → HIRES can't.

Star3: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star4: m=16.74 → HIRES can't.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, no: Star3's m is 15.5, so both can detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), and Star5 (15.0).

So which options include any of these?

Looking back at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't, Star5 can.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't, Star3 can.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can, Star4 can't.

So option B has Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both spectrographs.

Ah, I think this is the correct approach. So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, why? Because for Star3, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is already observed (so no need to adjust for extinction). So both spectrographs can detect it.

So in this case, Star3's m is 15.5, which is <=16, so HIRES can detect it, and <=17, so ESPRESSO can. Star5's m is 15.0, same.

So the correct option is option B: Star3 and Star5.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤ 16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 \).  
   - No extinction.  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - No extinction.  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO (≤ 17) but not by HIRES (> 16).

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Total absorption \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude \( m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 17.36 \).  
   - Not detectable by either ESPRESSO or HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 \).  
   - \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude \( m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.74 \).  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO (≤ 17) but not by HIRES (> 16).

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5(-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
   - No extinction.  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.0 \).  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1 (\( m = 15.5 \))** and **Star5 (\( m = 15.0 \))**. However, none of the options include both Star1 and Star5. Among the given options, **Option B (Star3 and Star5)** is the closest match, as Star5 is detectable by both spectrographs. Star3, with \( m = 15.5 \), is also detectable by both, making Option B valid.

**Answer: B**
