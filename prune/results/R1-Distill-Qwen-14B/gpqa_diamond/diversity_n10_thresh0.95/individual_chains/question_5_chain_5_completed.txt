Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector's elements from the given options.

First, I remember that for a quantum mechanical operator, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are found by solving the eigenvalue equation: P |ψ> = λ |ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue. But here, the operator is along an arbitrary direction, which suggests that we need to consider the operator in that direction. 

Wait, the operator isn't directly given as P, but as its components along x, y, and z. Oh right, the operator along a direction n (which lies in the x-z plane) can be written as P = (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z). So first, I need to express P in terms of these components.

But wait, since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z). But that's a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Hmm, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so perhaps I can parametrize it using an angle. Let's see, maybe n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, but wait, that depends on the convention. Or wait, sometimes in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle, so maybe it's more natural to have n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes θ is measured from the z-axis, so cosθ would be along z. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, because the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle is from the x-axis towards z. Not sure, but perhaps that's a detail I can handle as I go.

But wait, the operator P is along n, so P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). But since n has no y-component, the Py term will be zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. So I'll need to write out each matrix and then form the operator P.

Let me write down the matrices:

P_x matrix: [[0, 1],[1, 0]]
P_y matrix: [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
P_z matrix: [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

Each multiplied by ħ/2.

So, substituting these into P:

P = (n_x * ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]])

Wait, but wait. Since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, perhaps. Or maybe n_z is positive, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can express it as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), which would make sense if θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle from the z-axis would have θ as the polar angle, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating that part. Let me just proceed.

So, P = (ħ/2)(n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]])

Let me compute this matrix. Let me denote n_x and n_z as cosθ and sinθ, respectively, perhaps. So:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Is that right? Because when you add the matrices:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding them together:

Top-left: 0 + n_z = n_z
Top-right: n_x + 0 = n_x
Bottom-left: n_x + 0 = n_x
Bottom-right: 0 + (-n_z) = -n_z

So the matrix becomes [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]], multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator P is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2)|v>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So substituting P:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can factor out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So if I multiply both sides by 2/ħ, I get:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Wait, no. The vector is |v> = [a; b], a column vector. So the equation is:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

So, let me write these two equations:

1) n_z a + n_x b = a
2) n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me rearrange each equation:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
Equation 2: n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

So, we have a system of two equations:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

This system must have a non-trivial solution (since eigenvectors are non-zero), so the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Alternatively, we can solve for a and b.

Let me try to solve equation 1 and equation 2.

From equation 1: (n_z - 1) a = -n_x b => a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

But let me see if I can find a relation between a and b.

Alternatively, let's express equation 2 in terms of a and b.

Equation 2: n_x a = (n_z + 1) b => a = [ (n_z + 1) / n_x ] b

Wait, but from equation 1, a is also equal to [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

So setting them equal:

(n_z + 1)/n_x * b = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b

Assuming b ≠ 0, we can cancel it:

(n_z + 1)/n_x = -n_x/(n_z -1)

Cross-multiplying:

(n_z +1)(n_z -1) = -n_x^2

Left side: (n_z^2 - 1) = -n_x^2

So n_z^2 -1 = -n_x^2 => n_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1

Which is correct because n is a unit vector. So this doesn't give any new information, which makes sense because the equations are consistent.

So, from equation 2, a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b

So the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of b as:

a = [ (n_z +1) / n_x ] b

So the vector is proportional to [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ]^T.

But wait, that's modulo a scalar multiple. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of θ, since n_x and n_z are cosθ and sinθ. Let me assume n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Then:

a = [ (sinθ + 1) / cosθ ] b

So the vector becomes [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ, 1 ]^T multiplied by b.

To make it normalized, I'll have to find the normalization condition.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to parameterize the vector as (a, b) = [ ... ].

Wait, let me write the normalized eigenvector. Let me denote b as a parameter. Then a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.

So the vector is [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ] multiplied by b. But to normalize, I need to compute the normalization factor.

Wait, the vector is |v> = [ (n_z +1)/n_x * b, b ].

The inner product is |v|² = | (n_z +1)/n_x |² |b|² + |b|² = [ ( (n_z +1)^2 )/(n_x^2) + 1 ] |b|² 

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, perhaps I can write this in terms of θ.

Wait, let's substitute n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

So, a = (sinθ + 1)/cosθ * b

Then the vector is [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b, b ]

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So:

| (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b |² + |b|² = 1

= [ (sinθ +1)^2 / cos²θ ) + 1 ] |b|² = 1

Simplify the term inside:

(sinθ +1)^2 / cos²θ + 1 = [ (sin²θ + 2 sinθ +1 ) + cos²θ ] / cos²θ

Because when you multiply numerator and denominator by 1, it's (sinθ +1)^2 / cos²θ + (cos²θ)/cos²θ.

So numerator: sin²θ + 2 sinθ +1 + cos²θ.

But sin²θ + cos²θ =1, so numerator becomes 1 + 2 sinθ +1 = 2(1 + sinθ)

Denominator: cos²θ.

So the entire term is [2(1 + sinθ)] / cos²θ.

So:

[2(1 + sinθ) / cos²θ ] |b|² =1

So |b|² = cos²θ/( 2(1 + sinθ) )

But 1 + sinθ = (sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2))², and cosθ = cos²(θ/2) - sin²(θ/2) = (cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2))(cos(theta/2)+sin(theta/2)).

Alternatively, I can write 1 + sinθ = 2 sin²(theta/2 + pi/4), but perhaps it's easier to take square roots.

Let me compute |b|:

|b| = sqrt( cos²θ / [ 2(1 + sinθ) ] )

= [ cosθ ] / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) )

But wait, cosθ can be positive or negative, but in the x-z plane, the direction is arbitrary, so perhaps we can choose theta in a range where cosθ is positive, like from -pi/2 to pi/2. So cosθ is positive, so we can write |b| = cosθ / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) )

Hmm, but perhaps I can simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2) sqrt(1 + sinθ):

Wait, but perhaps I can rationalize the denominator.

Let me write 1 + sinθ as [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]^2, but not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's use the identity 1 + sinθ = 2 cos^2(theta/2 - pi/4), but maybe another approach.

Let me consider multiplying numerator and denominator inside the square root by (1 - sinθ):

So denominator becomes 2(1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ) ) = 2(1 - sin²θ) )= 2 cos²θ.

So |b| = [ cosθ ] / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) )

= cosθ / sqrt( [2(1 + sinθ)] )

Alternatively, if I multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 - sinθ), the denominator becomes sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ)) ) = sqrt(2(1 - sin²θ)) )= sqrt(2 cos²θ) )= sqrt(2) |cosθ|.

Since we're taking theta in a range where cosθ is positive, this simplifies to sqrt(2) cosθ.

So |b| = [ cosθ * sqrt(1 - sinθ) ] / sqrt(2) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, let's compute the square of |b|:

|b|² = cos²θ / [ 2 (1 + sinθ) ]

We can write cos²θ as (1 - sin²θ) = (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ)

So |b|² = (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) / [2(1 + sinθ)] ]

Simplify: (1 - sinθ) / 2

So |b| = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Similarly, |a| is | (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b | = | (1 + sinθ)/cosθ | * |b|

= (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Wait, but (1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ) = 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ, so:

(1 + sinθ)/cosθ = sqrt( (1 + sinθ)^2 ) / cosθ = [ sqrt(1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ) ] / cosθ.

Alternatively, (1 + sinθ) = sqrt( (1 + sinθ)^2 ) and cosθ is positive, so:

= sqrt( (1 + sinθ)^2 ) / cosθ.

But wait, perhaps it's better to compute |a|.

|a| = | (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b | = | (sinθ +1)/cosθ | * |b|

= (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

= [ (1 + sinθ) * sqrt(1 - sinθ) ) ] / ( cosθ * sqrt(2) )

But (1 + sinθ) * sqrt(1 - sinθ) = sqrt( (1 + sinθ)^2 (1 - sinθ) )

Hmm, maybe we can express this as sqrt( (1 + sinθ)^2 (1 - sinθ) ) = sqrt( (1 + sinθ)(1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ) )= sqrt( (1 + sinθ)(1 - sin²θ) ) = sqrt( (1 + sinθ) cos²θ )

So:

|a| = sqrt( (1 + sinθ) cos²θ ) / ( cosθ * sqrt(2) )

= [ cosθ sqrt(1 + sinθ) ] / ( cosθ * sqrt(2) )

= sqrt(1 + sinθ) / sqrt(2)

So |a| = sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector |v> is:

|v> = [ a, b ] = [ sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait, because when I compute a = (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b, and since cosθ is positive, and the square roots are positive, this should hold.

Wait, but in the expression for a:

a = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * b

and |b| = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

So:

a = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

= [ (1 + sinθ) * sqrt(1 - sinθ) ) ] / ( cosθ * sqrt(2) )

As before, which simplifies to sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), as we saw.

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ]

But wait, I should check the signs. Because when I took the square roots, I assumed they are positive, but perhaps the actual expression could have a negative sign. However, since the eigenvector is defined up to a global phase, the signs can be adjusted, so I can take them as positive for simplicity.

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ]

Which looks like sin(theta/2) and cos(theta/2), perhaps.

Wait, wait, I remember that:

sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 )

cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 )

Hmm, but in our case, it's with sinθ. So maybe not directly applicable.

Wait, but maybe we can express the terms in terms of cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the expressions.

Let me compute (1 + sinθ) = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2, but perhaps another approach. Alternatively, using the identity:

1 + sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2, but perhaps it's easier to write in terms of exponentials, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the eigenvector in terms of theta/2.

Wait, for example:

sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ) = sin( pi/4 + theta/2 )

Because sin(a + b) = ... wait, no, let's compute:

sin(pi/4 + theta/2) = sin(pi/4) cos(theta/2) + cos(pi/4) sin(theta/2) = (sqrt(2)/2)(cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)).

But (1 + sinθ) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2.

So sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2)

Similarly, sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) = [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2)

Which can be written as e^{-i phi/2} [ ... ] but perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector can be written as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ], but in this problem, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi would be 0, perhaps. Because in spherical coordinates, phi is the azimuthal angle, which would be zero in the x-z plane.

Wait, but wait, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so the angle phi (azimuthal) is zero or pi. So the eigenvector components might have terms without an exponential factor.

Wait, perhaps I got too deep into the algebra. Let me look back at the options provided.

The options are:

A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ )

Hmm, but the eigenvector shouldn't have ħ in its components because the eigenvectors are dimensionless. So this option may not be correct.

Option B: (cosθ, e^{i phi} sinθ )

Wait, but the normalized eigenvector shouldn't depend on phi, because in this problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So perhaps this option is applicable, but our earlier analysis shows that the components are sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ), which may not directly correspond to this option.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Hmm, that's interesting. If the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] normalized, then that would correspond to option C. But in our case, the normalized eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ]

Wait, let's compute cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2):

cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 )

sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 )

Which doesn't match our expressions.

Wait, but if we consider theta as some angle, perhaps there's a way to relate the two. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this problem from another angle. Since the operator P is along the direction n, which is in the x-z plane, the eigenvectors correspond to the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction. The spin matrices in an arbitrary direction can be expressed as a combination of the Pauli matrices multiplied by the direction components.

The general expression for the spin operator S along a direction n is (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z )

In this case, since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0.

So S = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, so for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector would be the spin-up state along n.

The eigenvector can be written in terms of the angles theta and phi, but since phi is zero (because n is in x-z plane), the eigenvector simplifies.

The general form for the spin-up state along n is:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But since phi is zero, it becomes:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which is option C.

Wait, that seems to align with option C. So perhaps that's the correct answer.

But wait, earlier when I went through the algebra, I ended up with [ sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ] as the normalized eigenvector. How does this relate to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]?

Let me calculate [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] squared.

cos(theta/2)^2 = (1 + cosθ)/2

sin(theta/2)^2 = (1 - cosθ)/2

So, the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] has components squared as (1 + cosθ)/2 and (1 - cosθ)/2, respectively.

Wait, that's different from what I found earlier, which was (1 + sinθ)/2 and (1 - sinθ)/2.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting n_x and n_z. Let me re-express the eigenvector.

Wait, because the direction in which we're aligning the operator is in the x-z plane, so the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So, in that case, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta), perhaps. Wait, that's a possible confusion. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the usual convention is that theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, so:

n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi)
n_y = sin(theta) sin(phi)
n_z = cos(theta)

But in our case, since phi is 0 (as it's in the x-z plane), n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, that's a possible source of confusion. So perhaps I should re-express the earlier analysis.

So, let's re-do the earlier steps with n_x = sin(theta) and n_z = cos(theta), given that the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis, and the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0.

So, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta)

So, the operator P is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] = (ħ/2) [ [cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)] ]

The eigenvalue equation is (P - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0

Which gives:

[ [cos(theta) -1, sin(theta) ], [ sin(theta), -cos(theta) - 1 ] ] [a, b]^T = 0

The equations are:

(cos(theta) -1) a + sin(theta) b =0      (1)
sin(theta) a + (-cos(theta) -1) b = 0    (2)

From equation (1):

a = [ sin(theta) / (1 - cos(theta)) ] b

Substituting into equation (2):

sin(theta) * [ sin(theta)/(1 - cos(theta)) ) b ] + (-cos(theta)-1) b =0

Multiply through:

[ sin^2(theta) / (1 - cos(theta)) ) + (-cos(theta) -1) ) ] b =0

Since b is non-zero, the term in brackets must be zero.

Let me compute the numerator:

sin^2(theta) / (1 - cos(theta)) ) + (-cos(theta)-1) = 0

But sin^2(theta) = (1 - cos^2(theta)) = (1 - cos(theta))(1 + cos(theta))

So,

( (1 - cos(theta))(1 + cos(theta)) ) / (1 - cos(theta)) ) - (cos(theta) + 1) ) = 0

Simplify:

(1 + cos(theta)) - (cos(theta) +1) ) =0 → 0=0.

Which is always true, so the equations are consistent.

Thus, a = [ sin(theta) / (1 - cos(theta)) ) ] b

But 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] b

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b

= cot(theta/2) b

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

To normalize, we compute the normalization factor.

Let me compute |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

a = cot(theta/2) b → |a| = |cot(theta/2)| |b|

So,

cot^2(theta/2) |b|^2 + |b|^2 =1

|b|^2 (cot^2(theta/2) +1 ) =1

But cot^2(x) +1= csc^2(x)

So,

|b|^2 = 1 / csc^2(theta/2) ) = sin^2(theta/2)

So, |b|= sin(theta/2)

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

a = cot(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

b= sin(theta/2)

So, |v> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which matches option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

So, the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the components of the unit vector $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are given, and $\vec{P}$ is expressed as:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]

where $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P$ into the eigenvalue equation and solving the resulting system of equations, the eigenvector is found to be proportional to:

\[
|v\rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor. The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, we analyze the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This is incorrect because the eigenvector components should be dimensionless, and $\hbar$ does not appear in the eigenvector.

- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
  This is incorrect because the eigenvector does not depend on $\phi$ in this problem, as $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and $\phi = 0$.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived normalized eigenvector and is correct.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This is incorrect because the eigenvector components should be dimensionless, and $\hbar$ does not appear in the eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
