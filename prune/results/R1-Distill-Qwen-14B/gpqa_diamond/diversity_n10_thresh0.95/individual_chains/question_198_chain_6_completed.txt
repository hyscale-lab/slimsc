Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see if I can figure it out. 

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So, what does that mean? I think dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN- ligands. So, the Co(SCN)_2^2+ ion, which is maybe the blue one. So, I need to find [Co(SCN)_2^2+] divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

Stability constants, right. Those are the formation constants, which tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So the formation of each complex depends on the previous ones because each step builds on the prior.

The general approach for such problems is to calculate the distribution of each species based on the stability constants. The species in solution would be Co^2+, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3^3+, and Co(SCN)_4^4+. Wait, but wait, the stability constants given are β1 to β4. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So, each β represents the formation of the next complex from the previous one.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a metal ion M and ligand L, the stability constant βn for the complex [ML_n]^z is given by the formation of that complex from the previous one. So, the total formation constant K_n for [ML_n] is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Or wait, no, maybe each βn is the stepwise formation constant. So, β1 is [ML]/[M][L], β2 is [ML2]/[ML][L], etc. So the overall K for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, each βn is the stepwise formation constant. For example, β1 = [CoSCN]/[Co²+][SCN^-]. β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]/[CoSCN][SCN^-], and so on. So the total formation constant K for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+n- is the product of β1 up to βn.

But wait, the question is about the percentages of each species. So, I need to calculate the concentration of each possible complex, then sum them all and find the percentage of the desired one.

But wait, considering that the complexes can form up to four SCN- ligands, but which ones are more dominant? Since the β values increase up to β3=63, then decrease for β4=16. Hmm, that's interesting. So the third complex is more stable than the second, but the fourth is less stable than the third.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the percentage of the second complex, the dithiocyanato one, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So that's the species with two SCN- ligands.

But to find the concentration of each species, I should compute the fraction of each species relative to the total. The formation of each complex depends on the concentration of the metal, the ligand, and the stepwise formation constants.

I remember that the fraction (f_n) of the nth complex can be calculated using the formula involving the product of all the β's up to that n, multiplied by the concentration of the ligand raised to the nth power, and then normalized by the sum of all such terms for all possible complexes.

Wait, but that's for the case where all possible complexes are considered. So, the general formula for the fraction f_n is [ (K_n) * [L]^n ] / sum_{m=0}^{M} [K_m * [L]^m ] }, where K_n is the overall stability constant for the nth complex.

But wait, K_m is the product of β1 to βm, right. So for each m (from 0 to 4), compute K_m = product of β1 to βm. But wait, when m=0, that's just the metal ion, Co²+.

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate K_0, K_1, K_2, K_3, K_4.

K_0 is for Co²+; it's 1 (since no complexation).

K_1 = β1 = 9

K_2 = β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360

K_3 = β1 * β2 * β3 = 9*40*63 = let me calculate that: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

K_4 = β1*β2*β3*β4 = 22680 *16 = 362880.

Wait, that's a big number. Hmm, but wait, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is not very high. So maybe higher complexes are less favored because the ligand concentration is low?

Wait, but the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1. So, for each K_m [L]^m, the denominator will be the sum of K0 [L]^0 + K1 [L]^1 + K2 [L]^2 + K3 [L]^3 + K4 [L]^4.

So in this case, [L] is 0.1 M.

So let me compute each term:

Term for m=0: K0 * [L]^0 = 1 * 1 = 1.

m=1: K1 * [L]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

m=2: K2=360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

m=3: K3=22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68

m=4: K4=362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Wait, so adding all these terms: 1 + 0.9 =1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468.

So the sum is approx 64.468.

But wait, wait a second. Because K_m for each m is the product of β1 to βm.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because for each complex [Co(SCN)_m]^2+, the overall formation constant K_m is the product of the stepwise constants β1, β2, ..., βm.

So for m=1: K1 = β1 =9.

m=2: K2 = β1*β2=9*40=360.

m=3: K3 =9*40*63=22680.

m=4: K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

But this seems correct.

So each term is K_m * [SCN^-]^m.

Now, the fractions of each species would be (K_m [L]^m) / sum_terms.

But wait, the metal's total concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all [Co species] is 1e-2 M.

Hmm, but wait, the fractions I'm calculating are the mole fractions of each species, so [Co(SCN)_m]^2+ / [Co_total] = (K_m [L]^m) / sum_terms.

Wait, no. Let me think.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^2+] + [Co(SCN)_3^3+] + [Co(SCN)_4^4+] = 1e-2 M.

But the fractions can be found by considering the distribution based on the stability constants.

Wait, the correct approach is to compute the distribution of Co in each species. The distribution ratio is given by the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The fraction f_m of each complex [CoL_m] is given by (K_m [L]^m) / (sum_{n=0}^4 K_n [L]^n ), where K_0=1 (for the free Co²+).

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the fraction for m=0 is [Co²+] = (K0 [L]^0) / sum_terms = 1 / 64.468 ≈ 0.01551.

For m=1, [CoSCN^+] = 9 *0.1 / 64.468 = 0.9 /64.468 ≈0.01396.

For m=2, [Co(SCN)_2^2+ ] = 360 * 0.01 /64.468 = 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05555.

Wait, let me compute each term.

Compute each term:

m=0: 1 *1 =1.

m=1: 9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: 360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: 22680 *0.001=22.68.

m=4:362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum all: 1 + 0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So sum is 64.468.

So, each fraction is term divided by 64.468.

For m=2, the term is 3.6, so fraction is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05555 or about 5.555%.

Wait, but that's only 5.555%, which is not among the options. The options are around 16-42%. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Wait, maybe the fractions should be calculated differently. Let me think again. Because the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

But wait, perhaps I forgot that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and that the sum is correct. But the fraction for m=2 is about 5.5%, which doesn't match any of the options. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the K4 calculation. Let me recalculate the terms.

Wait, K4 is β1*β2*β3*β4 =9*40=360. 360*63=22680. 22680 *16=362880. So that's correct.

Then, [SCN^-]^4 is (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288. Correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the order of the β's is different. Wait, the question lists β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps β4 is the formation constant for the fourth complex, not the third. So maybe the complexes are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. So K1 =β1=9, K2=β1*β2=360, K3=β1*β2*β3=22680, K4=β1*β2*β3*β4=362880.

So the calculation is correct. So why is the fraction so low?

Wait, but wait, the problem says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato" which is m=2. But maybe blue is the third complex, m=3? Because sometimes, different colors correspond to different complexes. But the question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- groups. So it's m=2.

But according to my calculation, the fraction is about 5.55%, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have thought about the logarithm of the stability constants, but no, the calculation seems correct.

Wait another angle: maybe I forgot that the ligand concentration is 0.1 M. Let me recompute each term:

m=0: 1

m=1: 9 * 0.1 =0.9

m=2: 360 * (0.1)^2=360 * 0.01=3.6

m=3: 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68

m=4: 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but according to this, the fraction is about 3.6 /64.468 = approximately 5.55%.

But the options don't have this. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stability constants given are not the stepwise β's but the overall K's. No, the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16." So βn is the stepwise formation constant for each step.

Wait, but let me think about the possible complexes. Could there be only three possible complexes, not four? Or perhaps the problem considers up to m=3, but not m=4? No, the β4 is given, so four complexes are possible.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the sum is not 64 but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate each term.

m=0: 1.

m=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: 360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3:22680 *0.001=22.68.

m=4:362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Adding these: 1 +0.9=1.9; plus 3.6 is 5.5; plus 22.68 is 28.18; plus 36.288 is 64.468.

Wait, that seems correct.

So, fraction for m=2 is 3.6/64.468 ≈0.05555, which is 5.55%. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the reverse, like the dissociation constants instead of the formation constants. But I don't think so because stability constants are for formation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the β4 is for the third complex, not the fourth. No, the way the question is stated, β1 is first complex, and so on up to β4. So four complexes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the way I'm calculating the K_m. Maybe K_m is the product of β1 through βm, but perhaps β4 is for the dithiocyanato complex, which is m=2. No, that doesn't make sense because β4 would be for the fourth complex, which would have four SCN- ligands.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the stability constants of the complexes Co(SCN)_n, where n=1 to 4, and each β is the overall K for that complex. So β1=9 is for [CoSCN], β2=40 is for [Co(SCN)_2], β3=63 is for [Co(SCN)_3], β4=16 is for [Co(SCN)_4]. If that's the case, then the K for each complex is βn, not the product.

Wait, that would be a different approach. Because in that case, for each m, K_m is β_m.

So let's reevaluate that.

In that scenario, K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Wait, but that's a possibility. Because sometimes, people define the stability constant as the overall K for the complex, not the stepwise. So the stability constant of [Co(SCN)_m] is β_m.

But that's not the usual convention. Stepwise formation constants are βn = [MLn]/[MLn-1][L].

But perhaps in this problem, the β's are the overall K for each complex. So each βn is the K for forming the nth complex from the metal and n ligands.

In that case, the K for [Co(SCN)_m]^n would be β_m.

So, [Co] = [Co²+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^2+] + [Co(SCN)_3^3+] + [Co(SCN)_4^4+]

The total concentration is 1e-2 M.

The fraction for each species is (β_m * [SCN^-]^m) / sum_{m=0}^4 (β_m * [SCN^-]^m), but wait, for m=0, it's just [Co²+], so K0=1.

Wait, but if the β's are the overall K's, then for each m, the fraction is (K_m [L]^m) / sum_terms.

So, let's recalculate with this approach.

K0 =1.

K1=β1=9.

K2=β2=40.

K3=β3=63.

K4=β4=16.

So, compute each term:

m=0: 1 *1 =1.

m=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

m=3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

m=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 1 + 0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So the sum is approximately 2.3646.

The fraction for m=2 (dithiocyanato) is 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, which is about 16.9%.

Looking back at the options, option D is 16.9%.

So that's the answer, which is option D.

Wait, but why did I get a different result earlier? Because I assumed that the β's were stepwise, but perhaps in this problem, they are the overall K's for that level.

So the confusion arises between stepwise and overall stability constants. The problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16." So, each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So, the approach where each K_m is β_m is correct.

Thus, the correct percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the ligand concentration. The stability constants are given as β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, and the thiocyanate concentration is [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Interpretation of Stability Constants**:  
   The stability constants (β) provided are the **overall stability constants** for each complex, meaning βₙ represents the stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁺. Thus, the fraction of each species is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
   \]  
   where \( \beta_0 = 1 \) corresponds to the free Co²⁺ ion.

2. **Calculate Each Term**:  
   Compute the contributions of each cobalt species based on the given β values and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M:  
   - For \( m = 0 \):  
     \[
     \beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1
     \]
   - For \( m = 1 \):  
     \[
     \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9
     \]
   - For \( m = 2 \):  
     \[
     \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4
     \]
   - For \( m = 3 \):  
     \[
     \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063
     \]
   - For \( m = 4 \):  
     \[
     \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016
     \]

3. **Sum of Terms**:  
   Add all contributions to find the total:  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**:  
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, \( m = 2 \)) is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

5. **Percentage Calculation**:  
   Convert the fraction to a percentage:  
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
