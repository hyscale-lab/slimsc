Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. So, the question is about stars and the effective temperature, and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the Boltzmann equation. 

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh wait, but how does that affect the photosphere? The photosphere is the visible part of the star, right?

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Level 1 and Level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And it's assumed that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that each region of the photosphere is at a uniform temperature and the usual equations apply.

So, I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the Teff is lower. Let me think: if T decreases, how does the ratio n2/n1 change? The exponential term is exp(-ΔE/(kT)), so as T goes down, the exponent becomes more negative because T is in the denominator. So the exponential term gets smaller, meaning n2/n1 decreases. So when Teff is 5500 K, the ratio is lower than at 6000 K.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the observed ratio is lower. So the ratio without spots is higher. The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes, so it's (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Let me write the formula for each case. Let's denote the ratio as R. So R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Assuming that the statistical weights g2/g1 are the same in both cases (no spots and with spots), because those are properties of the atom and not the star's temperature. So when calculating the ratio between the two situations, the g factors will cancel out.

So the ratio of the ratios would be [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute that. Because when you divide the two exponentials, their exponents subtract. So:

exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / exp( (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no. Let me double-check:

Actually, the denominator is R_with_spots = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), and R_no_spots = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

So the ratio R_no / R_with = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ]

Wait, wait. Let me compute the exponents:

[exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp[ (-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] = exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ]

Yes, that's right.

So, now I need to compute that exponent. But wait, ΔE is connected to the wavelength. The transition corresponds to a wavelength λ. So the energy difference is related to the photon energy via E = h c / λ.

Hmm, I think the formula is ΔE = hc / λ, but since we're dealing with the ratio in terms of k (Boltzmann's constant), I might need to express this in terms of the temperature.

Wait, but the units might be a problem here. Let me think: hc is in erg·Å or something? Alternatively, perhaps I can write the exponent in terms of temperature.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the ratio using the Saha equation or another approach, but wait, Saha equation is about ionization, not excitation. No, Boltzmann is for excitation between energy levels.

So, perhaps the approach is to compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors. So let me compute the exponent term.

First, get the energy difference per k. Let me compute ΔE/(k) = (hc/λ) / k.

Let me calculate hc/(k λ) numerically. Let's compute the value.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-27 erg·s.

c is speed of light: 3e10 cm/s.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-16 erg/K.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-8 cm.

So, hc/(kλ) = (6.626e-27 erg·s * 3e10 cm/s) / (1.38e-16 erg/K * 1448e-8 cm )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 6.626e-27 * 3e10 = 1.9878e-16 erg·cm.

Denominator: 1.38e-16 * 1448e-8 = 1.38e-16 * 1.448e-5 = (1.38 * 1.448) * 1e-21 ≈ (1.998) * 1e-21 = 1.998e-21 erg·cm/K.

So hc/(kλ) = (1.9878e-16) / (1.998e-21) ) ≈ (1e5) * (1.9878 / 1.998) ≈ approx 1e5 * 1 ≈ 1e5. Because 1.9878 is almost 1.998.

Wait, 1.9878 / 1.998 is approximately 0.999, so ~1.

So, hc/(kλ) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, wait, let me recompute the denominator: 1e-16 * 1e-5 (since 1448e-8 is 1.448e-5 cm) → 1e-21. So denominator is 1.38e-16 * 1.448e-5 = 1.38 * 1.448 = approx 1.995, so 1.995e-21.

Numerator is 6.626e-27 *3e10 = 1.9878e-16.

So 1.9878e-16 / 1.995e-21 = (1.9878 / 1.995) * 1e5 ≈ 0.996 * 1e5 ≈ 9.96e4 ≈ 1e5. So approximately 1e5 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So the exponent is (1e5 K) * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

With T1 being 6000 K (no spots) and T2 being 5500 K (with spots).

So let's compute 1/T2 - 1/T1.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1.

Subtract: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^-1.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1/T2 is 1/5500, which is larger than 1/6000 because T2 is smaller. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive.

So the exponent is 1e5 K * 0.000015151 K^-1 = 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = approx 1.5151.

So the exponent is about 1.5151.

So the factor is exp(1.5151) ≈ e^1.5151 ≈ e^1.5 is about 4.48, but 1.5151 is a bit more. Let me calculate e^1.5151.

We know that e^1 ≈2.718, e^1.6≈4.953, e^1.5≈4.4817, e^1.5151 is a bit higher.

Let me compute 1.5151 -1.5=0.0151. So e^1.5151 = e^1.5 * e^0.0151.

e^0.0151 ≈ 1 + 0.0151 + (0.0151)^2/2 ≈ 1.01527.

So 4.4817 * 1.01527 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.015 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.015) ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0672 ≈ 4.5489.

So approximately 4.55. So the factor is around 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, option D is ~2.9, option B is ~7.8, A is ~1.1.

Wait, but wait a second. Are we computing (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots or the inverse?

Because the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, the ratio without spots is higher. So our calculation is (n2/n1)_no / (n2/n1)_with = exp(1.5151) ≈4.55.

But wait, the ratio is n2/n1, which is the higher energy level over the lower. So when T increases, n2 increases relative to n1, making the ratio higher.

So the factor is ~4.5, which is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \left(\frac{g_2}{g_1}\right) \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_2/g_1 \) is the ratio of statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Since \( g_2/g_1 \) is constant, the ratio of the populations depends only on the exponential term.

The ratio of the ratios when the star has and does not have spots is:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spots). The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength \( \lambda \) of the transition by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{h c}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Substituting the constants:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{erg·s})(3 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s})}{1448 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}} \approx 1.36 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{erg}.
\]

The term \( \Delta E / k \) is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.36 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{erg}}{1.38 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{erg/K}} \approx 9850 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, calculate the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 9850 \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right).
\]

Compute \( \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818 \) and \( \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667 \). Their difference is:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0000151.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
9850 \times 0.0000151 \approx 0.1488.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\exp(0.1488) \approx 1.16.
\]

This means the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately \( 1.16 \) when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
