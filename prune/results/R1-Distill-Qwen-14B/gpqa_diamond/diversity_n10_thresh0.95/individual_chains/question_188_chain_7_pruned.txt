Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, rhombohedral crystal... I remember that a rhombohedral structure is a type of crystal system where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. Like, it's kind of a cube that's been skewed a bit. Oh right! The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, so that's the edge length 'a' of the unit cell, I think. And all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Right, because in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula from X-ray diffraction, specifically the Bragg's Law, but more importantly, the formula that relates the interplanar spacing (d) to the lattice parameters.

The general formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2hk cos α)/(l) + (2hl cos β)/(k) + (2kl cos γ)/(h) ) )... Wait, no, that's not quite right. Or maybe I'm mixing it up with another formula. Oh wait, another way: I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl)(cos θ) ) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Miller indices and the unit cell parameters.

Wait, I recall that for cubic systems, the formula is simpler, like d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), because all angles are 90 degrees. But in this case, it's rhombohedral, so angles are not 90, they're 30 degrees each. So the formula must take that into account.

Another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a general crystal system is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h k cos α + h l cos β + k l cos γ)/(a²). Is that right? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * (1/(1 - cos² α)) ) or something like that? No, maybe not. Alternatively, I remember that the distance d can be calculated using the formula:

d = [ a^2 (h² + k² + l²) - a (hk (cosα + cosβ + cosγ) - h^2 (cos 2α + cos 2β + cos 2γ) ) ] / [ sqrt( ... ) ]... Hmm, no, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should look it up in terms of the unit cell vectors. The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk (cos γ1 + cos γ2) + ... )) ?

No, perhaps I should think in terms of the metric tensor. The general formula for the interplanar spacing in a crystal is derived using the metric tensor, which depends on the lattice parameters and angles. The formula for d is:

d = sqrt( (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ) ) / (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) )

Wait, maybe not. Another approach: the formula for d in a general crystal is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h k cos α + h l cos β + k l cos γ)/(a²) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Maybe I should think in terms of the reciprocal vectors. The reciprocal space is involved in determining the interplanar distances. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by h, k, l, and the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of these vectors in reciprocal space, scaled appropriately.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h k (cos α + cos β + cos γ) + ... ) )

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, and all angles are equal. So for a rhombohedral crystal, the formula for interplanar distance simplifies because alpha = beta = gamma.

So the general formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) + ( ... terms involving cosines of angles ... )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta. So this simplifies the formula.

So the formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a0²) - (hk cos theta + hl cos theta + kl cos theta)/(a0²)

Wait, perhaps it's:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos theta / a²

So, 1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ] / a²

Wait, does that make sense? Let's test it with a cubic system where theta = 90 degrees. Then cos(theta) is 0, and the formula becomes 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a², so d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). Which is correct. So that seems right.

So in our case, h=1, k=1, l=1. And theta is 30 degrees, cos(theta) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So plugging in the numbers:

Numerator: (1² +1² +1²) - ( (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ) * cos(30°)
= 3 - (3) * (sqrt(3)/2)
= 3 - (3 * 0.8660)
= 3 - 2.598
≈ 0.402

So 1/d² = 0.402 / (a²). But a is given as 10 Angstroms, so a² is 100.

1/d² = 0.402 / 100 = 0.00402

So d² = 1 / 0.00402 ≈ 248.756

Taking square root, d ≈ sqrt(248.756). Let me compute that.

What's sqrt(256) is 16, sqrt(196) is 14. 248 is close to 256, so sqrt(248) ≈ 15.746. Wait, 15.746^2 is about 248. So d is approximately 15.746 / 10, because 10^2 is 100.

Wait no, wait. Wait, wait, let me re-calculate:

Wait, a is 10 Angstrom, so a² is 100 (Angstrom squared).

Wait, the calculation was 1/d² = [ (3) - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) ] / 100.

Wait, 3 minus 3*(sqrt(3)/2) is 3(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ). sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So 1 - 0.866 = 0.134, multiplied by 3 is 0.402.

So 1/d² = 0.402 / 100 = 0.00402 → d² = 1/(0.00402) ≈ 248.756.

d = sqrt(248.756) ≈ 15.77 Å? Wait, wait, but that can't be right because the interatomic distance is 10 Å, and the interplanar distance is generally smaller, but wait, wait, no. Wait, interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell. The interplanar distance is the distance between planes, which can be longer or shorter depending on the plane.

Wait, no, for cubic systems, the (111) plane has d = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å. So if here, a is 10, and we're getting a d of around 15, but that's way larger than 10. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, what's wrong here. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, perhaps I had the formula wrong. Maybe I should think in terms of the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a crystal is given by:

g = [ 1   cos α/2   cos β/2
      cos α/2   1   cos γ/2
      cos β/2  cos γ/2   1 ]

Wait, no, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system. Wait, another approach: the volume of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ). But perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors.

Wait, but that would be the formula for a rhombohedral system. So let's see:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

So, for (111), h=k=l=1.

So,

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 3 cos(theta) )

Given a=10, theta=30 degrees, cos(theta)=√3/2 ≈0.866.

So denominator is sqrt(3 -3*(0.866)) = sqrt(3 - 2.598) = sqrt(0.402) ≈ 0.634.

So, d= 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.77 Angstrom.

Wait, but that's way larger than a=10. That can't be right, because in a cubic system, (111) has d= a/sqrt(3)≈5.77 Angstrom, which is smaller than a.

But in our calculation, it's giving a much larger d. That suggests I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the reciprocal. Maybe I inverted the formula somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, another source I recall, the formula for d is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Wait, but that can't be correct because 1 would be in the same units as a. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk cos theta + hl cos theta + kl cos theta) )

Wait, let's compute that.

For (111), h=k=l=1.

So,

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 - 3 * cos(30) )

cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So,

3 * cos(30) = 3 * 0.866 ≈2.598.

So denominator is sqrt(3 -2.598) = sqrt(0.402) ≈0.634.

So, d= 10 / 0.634 ≈15.77 Angstrom.

Again, that's about 15.77, but that's larger than the lattice parameter. In cubic systems, the (111) plane has a d-spacing of about 5.77, which is smaller than a=10 in this case. So perhaps the formula is correct, but in rhombohedral systems, the d-spacing can be larger than the lattice parameter.

But wait, the options are all below 10. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + hl + kl)(cos theta) )

Wait, let's see.

In cubic systems, cos theta is zero, so that would give d = a / sqrt(3) as before.

But wait, in our case, the angles are 30 degrees, so cos theta is positive. So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 +3*0.866) = sqrt(3 +2.
