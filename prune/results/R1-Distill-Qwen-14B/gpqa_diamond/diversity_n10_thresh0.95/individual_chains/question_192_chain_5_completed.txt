Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the setup is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. I need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L. But it's also l distance from the cavity's center, and l and L are both larger than R. Oh, and there's an angle theta between l and s. Hmm.

I remember that for conductors, the charges reside on the surface. But wait, this conductor is uncharged, so initially, it has no charge. But when I put a charge inside the cavity, what happens? I think the inner cavity's charge will induce charges on the conductor's inner surface.

Right, when you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to it. So, in this case, the +q inside causes the inner surface of the conductor to have -q. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral overall because the outer surface must then have +q to balance it out, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface has induced -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge zero. Because the conductor as a whole remains neutral. So the outer surface has +q.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So I'm looking to calculate the electric field there. Now, I remember that outside a conducting shell, the electric field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for the conductor, the field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_total) / r², where r is the distance from the center.

In this case, the outer surface has charge +q, so the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface outside the conductor is +q. So the electric field at point P, which is outside, should depend only on +q.

Wait, but the setup is a bit more complicated because the cavity isn't at the center. The cavity's center is offset by s from the conductor's center. Oh, right, and point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, but l from the cavity's center, and there's an angle theta between l and s.

But wait, from the perspective of the conductor's shell, the charge distribution on the outer surface is spherically symmetric, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, so any external point would see the charges as if they're at the center. So, the position of the cavity's center and the angle theta shouldn't matter for the electric field outside.

Wait, but wait, the charge +q is inside the cavity. The conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the charges that contribute are the outer charges, which are uniformly distributed (for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). So the field outside should be as if the entire charge is at the center of the conductor.

So, the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L^2. Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Looking at the options, option B says that. Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but what about the position of the cavity? Does that influence the outer field? I think not, because the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform regardless of what's happening inside. The inner charges are screened, so outside, you just have the field from the outer charge.

But wait, let's think again. If the cavity is off-center, does that change the distribution of the outer charges? Hmm, in an uncharged conductor with a cavity, when you place a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to it. But because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the charge inside the cavity. So, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, as the conductor is a sphere.

So, regardless of where the cavity is placed inside the conductor (as long as the conductor is a sphere), the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed. So, the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is q, and the distance from the center of the conductor.

Therefore, the correct electric field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but l from the cavity's center. But since the field outside depends only on the total outer charge, and the position of the cavity doesn't affect the outer distribution, the angle theta and l shouldn't matter. So yeah, option B is correct.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor as a whole remains neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed by the conductor. In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge of $+q$, and the field outside is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. The position of the cavity, the distance $s$, the angle $\theta$, or the distance $l$ from the cavity's center to point $P$ do not affect the electric field outside the conductor, as the outer surface charge distribution is uniform and spherically symmetric.

3. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: Point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression depends on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is unrelated to the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression depends on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the denominator is $l^2$, this does not account for the correct distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

Thus, the correct answer is based on the uniform distribution of charge on the outer surface of the conductor and the fact that the electric field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

Answer: B
