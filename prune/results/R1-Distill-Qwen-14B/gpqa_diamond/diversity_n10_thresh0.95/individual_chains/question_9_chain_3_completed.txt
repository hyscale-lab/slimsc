Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, and I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is important for understanding their structure and properties, like in spectroscopy and reactions.

First, I should probably recall what C3h symmetry means. Oh right, symmetry elements include a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around that axis and also have a mirror plane that includes the axis.

The options given are four different molecules. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated. I think it's a tricyclic compound with multiple rings. Triphenylene is a structure with three benzene rings connected in a certain way. The trifuran part probably means three furan rings attached somehow. Wait, maybe it's a larger polycyclic structure with several rings fused together. I'm not sure about the exact structure, but I remember that some polycyclic compounds have higher symmetry. But I'm not certain if this has C3h.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Benzo rings attached to a trifuran, which is a central furan with three substituents. So benzo rings attached at specific positions. Wait, benzo rings are six-membered, and the positions where they are attached might influence the symmetry. If the substituents are symmetrically placed, maybe this molecule has a certain symmetry. But I'm not sure if it's C3h.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. I remember this structure. Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a CH(CH2CH3)2. So the molecule is B with three such substituents. The structure is trigonal planar around the boron, right? Because boron usually has three bonds. Wait, but each isopropyl group is itself symmetric. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar arrangement. So the central B is connected to three identical isopropyl groups. So, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis (C3) because the three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically. But what about the mirror planes? Triangular symmetry usually includes a plane perpendicular to the C3 axis. So maybe it has C3h symmetry. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Borate molecules with three identical substituents usually have D3h symmetry, which includes a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So if it's D3h, that would include C3h as part of it. Hmm, but the question is about C3h symmetry, which is a subset. So perhaps this molecule has at least C3h symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure if it's more than that. Alternatively, maybe it's just C3 without the mirror plane. Hmm, I might need to think more about that.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, I think. It's a norbornane derivative, a bridged bicyclic amine. The structure has a bridge, so the molecule is quite rigid. Quinuclidine has a certain symmetry. I remember that it's a seven-membered ring, but wait, no. Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Quinuclidine is the nitrogen-containing analog. So it's a bicyclo structure with a bridge, and I think it has a plane of symmetry. But does it have a three-fold axis? I don't think so. Quinuclidine's structure is more like a boat-shaped molecule, and I'm not sure about the symmetry elements. Maybe it only has a C2 axis or some other lower symmetry. So perhaps it doesn't have C3h.

So now, going back to each option. I think the key is to figure out which molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. If it's a trigonal planar arrangement with three identical substituents, then its symmetry group would likely be D3h. D3h includes C3 and σh. So it definitely has C3h symmetry. But wait, sometimes when substituents are bulky, the symmetry might be lower. But in this case, the substituents are all isopropyl groups, which are identical. So the molecule would be symmetric under 120-degree rotations and have a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis. So this molecule should have C3h symmetry.

Option A and B: Let's think about their structures. For benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. Wait, the benzo rings are attached at certain positions on the trifuran. So the positions could be such that there's a three-fold symmetry. Hmm, but each benzo ring is in a different position, so maybe the molecule doesn't have a three-fold axis. Alternatively, maybe the way the rings are fused creates a three-fold symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's more of a D3h symmetry for option A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. Triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a central position. So the structure would have a three-fold symmetry around the central axis. So perhaps this molecule has a C3h symmetry. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the presence of three benzene rings arranged symmetrically around a central point would give a three-fold rotation axis. And the trifuran part would have substituents arranged symmetrically as well. So maybe this molecule has a three-fold axis (C3) and a mirror plane (h), giving C3h symmetry.

Wait, but now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option's structure and their symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate (Option C): Structure is B with three isopropyl groups. The isopropyl groups are all the same and arranged in a trigonal planar fashion around B. So, the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis (C3), since rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. Also, there's a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that bisects the molecule, perpendicular to the C3 axis. So this would give C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine (Option D): I think it's a bridged bicyclic compound. The structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with an amine group. I'm not sure if it has a three-fold axis. Its symmetry might be lower. It has a plane of symmetry, maybe a C2 axis, but not a C3. So probably doesn't have C3h.

Now, the other two options (A and B) are more complex. Let's try to visualize them.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So this is a trifuran (three fused furan rings?) with benzo groups attached. Wait, trifuran is a structure with three furan rings fused together. The benzo groups are attached at specific positions. So for example, each benzo ring is attached to a different part of the trifuran. If the substituents (benzo groups) are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule could have a three-fold axis. But I'm not sure. For instance, if each benzo is attached at each of the three positions around the central furan, then rotating 120 degrees would map the substituents onto each other, implying a C3 axis. If also, there's a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis, then C3h would be present. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say, but I think Option B might have a three-fold axis but maybe not the mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not planar, which would reduce the symmetry.

Option A: Triphenyleno... So it's a trifuran with three phenyl groups attached. The way the phenyls are attached could create a three-fold symmetry. If each phenyl is attached at 120-degree positions around the trifuran, then the molecule would have a C3 axis. If there is a mirror plane, then C3h. But I'm not sure if the substituents are arranged to allow that.

Alternatively, perhaps the triphenylene part is a central ring where three phenyl groups are attached, each at 120 degrees. Then the trifuran could be arranged symmetrically as well. So this might have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but which of these options is correct? Let me think again about each symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate is a good candidate. Because the three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically in a trigonal planar fashion, so it has a C3 axis. Additionally, because the molecule is planar (at least around the boron), there's a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis. So yes, that would make C3h symmetry.

So among the options, option C is Triisopropyl borate. But wait, looking at the options, the options are labeled A, B, C, D. The question lists the options, and the actual choices are the four molecules given as options. Let me check:

The question says:
Options:
A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[...]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So the options are labeled A to D, each corresponding to one of the four given molecules.

So in the question, the correct answer is the molecule with C3h symmetry. From my analysis, triisopropyl borate (Option C) has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought D3h is the symmetry for triisopropyl borate, which includes C3h. So does that mean it has C3h symmetry? Yes, because D3h includes C3h as a subset. So the presence of C3h is a given.

The other options:

Option B: Benzo...trifuran. I'm not sure about its symmetry. Maybe it's C3 without the mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps it's D3h but I don't think so because the substituents are benzo rings, which are all the same. Hmm, but the way they're attached might affect symmetry. If each benzo is attached at 120-degree positions, that would imply a three-fold axis, but whether there's a mirror plane is another question.

Option A: Triphenyleno...trifuran. The triphenylene part would have three identical phenyl groups attached symmetrically, which would give a C3 axis. If the trifuran is arranged symmetrically, perhaps there's a mirror plane. So this could also have C3h symmetry.

Wait, so now I'm unsure because I thought option C is correct, but perhaps option A is also a contender.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenylenetrifuran has a higher symmetry, like D3h, but I'm not certain.

I think I need to differentiate between the structures.

Option C is a borate with three identical substituents, which is a good candidate for C3h symmetry.

Option A: Triphenyleno...trifuran. The triphenylene part is a central ring with three phenyl groups attached. So, the molecule would have three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically, which gives a C3 axis. Additionally, if the molecule is planar, then a mirror plane would be present, leading to C3h.

But wait, the molecule also has a trifuran system. So the trifuran is a central part with three furan rings. So the entire molecule might be more of a polycyclic system with a three-fold symmetry.

Hmm, but in reality, I think triisopropyl borate is more likely to have C3h symmetry. Because each substituent is the same and arranged symmetrically around the central atom.

So, putting it all together, option C (Triisopropyl borate) has C3h symmetry. So the answer should be option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structures and symmetry elements. **C₃h symmetry** requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C₃ axis.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three phenyl groups attached symmetrically. The phenyl groups are arranged at 120° angles around the central axis, which suggests a C₃ rotation axis. However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is uncertain due to the complexity of the polycyclic structure. While it may have C₃ symmetry, it is not clear if it satisfies the full C₃h symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a trifuran core with benzo rings attached at specific positions. The symmetry depends on the arrangement of the benzo rings. If they are positioned symmetrically, a C₃ rotation axis could exist. However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is unclear due to the fused ring system. This molecule likely has C₃ symmetry but does not definitively exhibit C₃h symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. The three-fold rotation axis (C₃) is present due to the symmetric arrangement of the substituents. Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C₃ axis. Thus, triisopropyl borate exhibits C₃h symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a rigid, bridged structure. Its symmetry is lower than C₃h, as it lacks a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). While it has a plane of symmetry, it does not satisfy the requirements for C₃h symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** is the only molecule that clearly exhibits C₃h symmetry due to its trigonal planar geometry with a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). 

Answer: C
