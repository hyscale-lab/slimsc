Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. Oh wait, LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, right? So each region of the photosphere is in equilibrium with the local radiation field.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, what does that mean? Oh, I think it refers to the population of the excited state. So the number of atoms in that energy level is twice as high in star_1.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I need to relate the excitation to the temperature using the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the population ratio of two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

So, let me write the formula. The ratio of populations N_upper/N_lower is equal to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.

In this case, N1 (for star_1) is twice N2 (star_2). So N1/N2 = 2. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the energy levels are the same because it's the same transition for both stars. So for each star, the population ratio would be determined by their respective temperatures.

So for star_1: N1 = (exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)))
For star_2: N2 = (exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)))

So the ratio N1/N2 = exp(ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] )

Wait, wait. Let's think again. The ratio N_upper/N_lower is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if the excited state is the upper level, then N_upper/N_lower = exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, but in the question, the excited state is the same for both stars, and the same energy difference. So for star 1, the population is twice as excited as star 2. So N1_upper is 2 times N2_upper? Or wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the population of the excited state is higher in star_1.

So N1/N2 = 2.

But wait, the actual formula for the ratio would be N1/N2 = [ (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ) ]? Hmm, but I think the statistical weights (g factors) are the same for the same transition in both stars, so they cancel out.

So N1/N2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ) = 2.

Wait no, wait. Let me correct that. The ratio is N1/N2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )?

Wait, no. Let me think. Let me denote for each star, the ratio of upper to lower level is:

For star 1: N1_upper / N1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: N2_upper / N2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So I think it's that N1_upper is higher than N2_upper. Wait, no—wait, the question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So the specific energy level is the excited state (the upper level). So the population of the upper level is higher in star_1.

But wait, the ratio N_upper/N_lower is higher when T is higher because higher temperatures increase the excitation. So if star_1 has higher excitation, its T is higher than star_2's.

But the problem says that the population in that specific level is twice as much. So perhaps N_upper for star_1 is 2*N_upper for star_2? Or is it the ratio of the populations (upper to lower) that's twice?

Wait, the question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think that the number of excited atoms (in that level) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So N1_upper = 2 N2_upper.

Alternatively, the ratio N_upper/(N_upper + N_lower) might be considered, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio N_upper/N_lower is twice for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, that's a critical point. The question isn't entirely clear. Let me read again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

So, perhaps the excitation is the population of the excited state. So N1_upper = 2 N2_upper.

But another interpretation could be that the excitation energy (the energy per atom) is higher, but that's not likely given the setup.

So, let's proceed with the first interpretation: N1_upper = 2 N2_upper.

But wait, that's not the ratio of the populations. The ratio of the populations would be (N_upper)/(N_lower) for each star.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of the upper to lower for each star.

Let me denote for star 1: N1_upper / N1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: N2_upper / N2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, N1_upper = 2 N2_upper.

Wait, but without knowing N_lower for each, I can't directly relate these. So perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of the upper to lower populations. Because in that case, the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

So let's say that (N1_upper/N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower)

Because star_1's excitation is twice as much in that level. So that would be:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but that can't be right because the exponent would be negative. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ratio N1_upper/N1_lower is twice that of N2_upper/N2_lower.

So:

(N1_upper/N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower)

Which would give:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, that seems a bit tricky. Let's take natural logs of both sides.

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Let me rearrange this equation.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, but wait, that would lead to something like:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So putting it together:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But I'm not sure about this. Let me think if I did that correctly.

Wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yes.

So the equation becomes:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But I don't know the value of ΔE. The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. But Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, that's interesting because the given ΔE is exactly k (Boltzmann's constant) times 1 J/(something), but let me compute.

Wait, k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k * (1 K). So ΔE = k * 1 K.

Wait, that's a key point. So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So substituting ΔE = k * 1 K into the equation:

( (k * 1 K) / k ) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Simplify the first term: (k *1 K) /k = 1 K.

So the equation becomes:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) * K? Wait, no, because 1 K is unitless in this context. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating units here.

Wait, because ΔE is in J, and k is J/K, so ΔE/(k) would be (J)/(J/(K)) ) = K. So in the equation, (ΔE/(k)) is 1 K.

So the equation is:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2)

So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / 1 K * K? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled up in units here.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed without units. So, since ΔE is k*T, where T is 1 K, let me think.

Wait, maybe I took a wrong turn earlier. Let me try a different approach.

The ratio of the excitation is N1_upper / N1_lower = 2 * (N2_upper / N2_lower )

Which would be:

exp( - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( - ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = - ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2 )

Bring the ΔE/(k T2 ) term to the left:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2 ) = - ln(2 )

Factor ΔE/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] = - ln(2 )

Which becomes:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = - ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

So now, substituting ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k * 1 K, since k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k * 1 K.

Substituting into the equation:

(k * 1 K )/(k ) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Simplify:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But wait, 1 K is a unit, but in the equation, it's being multiplied by another term which is dimensionless. So perhaps this indicates I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without substituting ΔE = k * (1 K), and instead proceed symbolically.

So the equation is:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting that in:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But K is a unit, so this suggests that the left-hand side is (K * something) = ln(2) (which is dimensionless). That can't be correct, so perhaps I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the ratio of the excitation is not N1_upper/N2_upper = 2, but the ratio N1_upper/N1_lower is twice as much as N2_upper/N2_lower.

Wait, that's a different scenario. Let me try this approach again.

Assume that for star_1, the excitation is higher, so the ratio N1_upper/N1_lower = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower )

Which is:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Rearrange:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2 )

Factor ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

Which is:

ΔE/(k) * ( T1 - T2 )/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But ΔE/(k) is 1 K, so:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, this still leaves me with units that don't match. Because the left side is (K * (something with K in the denominator)), but right side is dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the condition is that the excitation is twice as much, but in terms of the ratio of upper to lower states. So, for star_1, the ratio is higher than for star_2.

So, (N1_upper/N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower)

Which gives:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Move the ΔE/(k T2) term to the left:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2 )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2 )

Which is:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Again, same equation as before. So substituting ΔE = k * 1 K:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but 1 K is 1 Kelvin, which is a unit of temperature. So the left side is (K * (something with units of 1/K^2 )) ), which would give units of 1/K. But the right side is ln(2), which is unitless.

So something's wrong here. Maybe I messed up the initial setup.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the statement is that the excitation is twice as much, which implies the ratio N_upper/N_total is twice as much for star_1. But that would complicate things because N_total is the sum of N_upper and N_lower. But that's probably more complicated than the question expects.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of the two excitation states, but perhaps the problem was referring to the populations in a different way. Maybe the level is more excited in star_1, meaning that the excitation temperature is higher.

Wait, another approach: The excitation can be described by the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more atoms are in the upper energy level.

The excitation temperature is sometimes used in this context, but in LTE, the excitation temperature is the same as the kinetic temperature.

So the ratio of the populations can be written as (N1/N2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but in this case, the same ΔE applies to both stars. So for star 1, the ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, it's exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the problem says that star_1's population is twice that of star_2. So:

N1/N2 = 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ) = 2

Take natural logs:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

Again, same equation as before.

But since ΔE/(k) = 1 K, then:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but K is a unit of temperature. So the term (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) has units of 1/K. So multiplying by K gives (K * 1/K) ) = dimensionless. So left side is dimensionless, matching the right side (ln(2) is dimensionless). So that's correct.

So the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) )

Wait, but that can't be, because 1 K is a unit. Wait, perhaps I should just proceed without considering units for the sake of the equation.

So, I have:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2

But looking at the options, let's see.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1*T2)

Which is exactly what I have. So the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct option is D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Excitation and the Boltzmann Distribution**:  
   The population ratio of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:
   \[
   \frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
   \]
   where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature.

2. **Given Condition**:  
   The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2. This implies:
   \[
   \frac{N_{1,\text{upper}}}{N_{1,\text{lower}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{2,\text{upper}}}{N_{2,\text{lower}}}.
   \]

3. **Substituting the Boltzmann Distribution**:  
   For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:
   \[
   \frac{N_{1,\text{upper}}}{N_{1,\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{N_{2,\text{upper}}}{N_{2,\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
   \]
   Substituting the given condition:
   \[
   \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation**:  
   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   -\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
   \]
   Rearranging terms:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]
   Factoring the temperature terms:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
   \]

5. **Substituting \( \Delta E \)**:  
   Since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we have:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
   \]
   Substituting this into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
   \]

6. **Matching with Options**:  
   The derived equation matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is given by **Option D**.  
**Answer: D**
