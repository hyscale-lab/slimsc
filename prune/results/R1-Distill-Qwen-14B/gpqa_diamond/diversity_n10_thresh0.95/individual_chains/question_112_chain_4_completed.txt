Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through the question again.

The problem says that we have an electron state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the standard basis for spin-½ particles. So, I guess |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1) in the computational basis.

The first task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 if i=j. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, that would be:
[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2 0 ]
Because diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are hbar/2. Hmm.

I remember that such a matrix is an example of an operator in the spin space. Since the diagonal is zero, it's probably related to the spin in the x or y direction, but maybe not exactly. Wait, the Pauli matrices: the X and Y matrices have off-diagonal elements. Let me think, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], sigma_z is diag(1,-1). So the given matrix A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x, perhaps? Because sigma_x has the same structure. So A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

So, the operator is sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2. We need to find the eigenstates of A, which are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x since it's a scalar multiple.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, they are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so the eigenstates are those combinations.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, and the probabilities we're looking for are the probabilities of |alpha> being in each of these states.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. No, wait. The eigenstates of sigma_x are actually (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but with some phase factors perhaps. Because sigma_x is Hermitian, its eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis.

So, the problem is to find the probability that the state |alpha> is measured in |+x> and |-x>.

But first, I need to normalize |alpha>, right? Because the question states that |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, which means it's not yet normalized. So I need to find the normalization factor.

Let me compute the norm of |alpha>. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 +i). Let me compute each part.

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 -i + i - i² = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Similarly, (2 - i)(2 +i) = 4 + 2i - 2i -i² = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the total norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> because the probabilities are the square of the coefficients in that expansion.

Wait, let's write the eigenstates of A (which are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates):

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, actually, wait. The correct eigenstates for sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but wait, that can't be right because sigma_x applied to |+x> would be |+x> again times 1, but let me check.

Wait, sigma_x |+x> = sigma_x (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) = (sigma_x |up> + sigma_x |down>)/sqrt(2). Since sigma_x |up> is |down> and sigma_x |down> is |up>. So it becomes (|down> + |up>)/sqrt(2) = same as |+x>, so yes, that's correct. So |+x> is correct.

Wait, but when I think about sigma_x, it's the Pauli X matrix, which flips the spin. So yes, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> as I wrote.

So now, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write:

|alpha> = a|+x> + b|–x>, and calculate |a|^2 and |b|^2 as the probabilities.

But wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is already expressed in the computational basis, and the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> are known, I can compute the inner products.

So let's compute the coefficients a and b.

a = < +x | alpha > 
= [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]
= [ (1 + 0) + (0 + 1) ) ] / sqrt(2*7) multiplied by (1+i) and (2 -i).

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

The inner product < +x | alpha > is:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 - i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

But <up|down> is zero, and same for <down|up>.

So this simplifies to:

(1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(1) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ 3 + 0i ] = 3/sqrt(14).

Wait, because (1+i + 2 -i) = 3.

So a = 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute b = < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> - (1+i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Again, cross terms are zero.

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)(1) - (2 -i)(1) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) - (2 -i) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1-2) + (i +i) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ -1 + 2i ]

So b = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate the numerator:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 + i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i.

Yes, correct.

So a is 3/sqrt(14), and b is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait. Because |+x> and |-x> should form a complete basis, so |a|^2 + |b|^2 should equal 1.

Let me check |a|^2: (3)^2 /14 =9/14.

|b|^2: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. Correct.

So the probabilities are |a|^2=9/14 and |b|^2=5/14.

Wait, but let me compute |b|^2 again.

b is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). So |b|^2 is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Converting to decimal, 9/14 ≈ 0.6429, 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A: 0.64 and 0.36. That's close to 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is about 0.3571, which is 0.36. So the probabilities would be about 64% and 36%.

Wait, but let me check the other parts of the question. The question also asks for the average value of that operator. So the operator is A, which is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator (because it's a scalar multiple of a Hermitian matrix), the expectation value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since |alpha> is a normalized state, and A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, perhaps it's easier to compute in the computational basis.

But wait, from the way |alpha> is defined, perhaps I can compute <sigma_x> and then multiply by hbar/2.

Alternatively, compute <A> = (hbar/2) < sigma_x >, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So let's compute <sigma_x> for the state |alpha>.

The expectation value of sigma_x is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by sigma_x (applied to the state) which is [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.

Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when applied to |alpha>, which is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T, sigma_x |alpha> is [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So the inner product <alpha | sigma_x | alpha> is the conjugate of the first component multiplied by the first component of sigma_x |alpha>, plus the conjugate of the second component multiplied by the second component.

Wait, <alpha | sigma_x | alpha> = ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )*^* * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) + ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )*^* * (1+i)/sqrt(7) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The state |alpha> is (a, b), so <alpha| is (a^*, b^*). Applying sigma_x to |alpha> gives (b, a), because sigma_x swaps the components. So the inner product <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is a^* b + b^* a.

So in this case:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So a^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7)
b^* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7)

Compute a^* b + b^* a:

= [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] / (7)

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) + 2(i) +i(1) +i(i) = 2 + 2i +i + (-1) ) = (2-1) + 3i = 1 +3i.

So sum: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) )= 2. 

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. That matches the probabilities and the expectation value.

But wait, option D says 0.61, 0.29, which are approximately 61% and 30%. But our calculated probabilities are 9/14 (≈64.28%) and 5/14 (≈35.71%). So option A's first two numbers are 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14 (≈0.3571).

Wait, but wait. Let me recompute the probabilities:

The probabilities are |a|^2 = (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14 = approx 0.642857.

And |b|^2 is 5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are about 64.29% and 35.71%. But the option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are close. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. So the answer might be option A.

But wait, let me check the other options. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which is lower than our values.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating a and b. Let me recheck.

Wait, let me re-calculate a.

a = < +x | alpha >.

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So a = 1/sqrt(14) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ].

Wait, because <up| up> is 1, and <down| down> is1, and the cross terms are zero.

So a = (1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(14) = (3)/sqrt(14).

So yes, correct.

b is < -x | alpha > = 1/sqrt(14) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ].

Which is (1 +i -2 +i ) / sqrt(14) ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

So |a|^2 is 3²/14=9/14.

|b|^2 is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

So 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded up. So option A matches the probabilities and the expectation value.

Wait, but wait another thing. The operator A is given as Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else zero. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]. So that's the same as (hbar/2) * sigma_x. So the expectation value would be (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x for |alpha>.

Which, as I computed, is (hbar/2)*(2/7) )= hbar/(7). So that matches option A's third value.

So the correct answer is option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average value hbar/7.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the \( z \)-projection of spin. To normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \), we calculate its norm:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, \( |\alpha\rangle \) becomes:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is equivalent to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are determined by the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these eigenstates.

The overlap \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | + \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The overlap \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | - \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these overlaps:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429,
\]
\[
P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

To compute the average value of \( A \), we use the expectation value formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value becomes:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( (1+i)(2-i) + (2-i)(1+i) \right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \) match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
