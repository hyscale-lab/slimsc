Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to think this through. Let's break it down.

First, what's parallax? Oh right, parallax is a measure of how far away a star is from us. The closer the star, the larger its parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is pretty far away, I think. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: actually, the parallax p is inversely proportional to the distance d. So p (in arcseconds) is equal to 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if a star is at 1 parsec, the parallax is 1 arcsec. If it's at 2 parsecs, parallax is 0.5, and so on.

Now the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, does that mean their distances are uniform? Or their positions on the sky? Hmm. I think it's about the distribution of distances. So if they're uniformly distributed, the number density of stars at a certain distance would be the same for each parsec. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I consider a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars N in that range depend on plx?

Let me think about the relation between distance and parallax. Parallax p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So if the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd would be proportional to the surface area of that shell, right? Because in a uniform distribution, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant, so the number in a shell is density * volume of the shell.

The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² * dd. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d² * dd. But since we're interested in stars per unit parallax range, not per unit distance, I need to express this in terms of p.

Given p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. The thickness in parallax would be dp. How does dd relate to dp?

Let me compute that. Since p = 1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. But since we're considering the range, the negative sign just indicates direction, which doesn't matter for the magnitude. So dd = (1/p²) dp. Because d = 1/p, so d squared is 1/p².

So substituting back into the number of stars in the shell: N ∝ d² * dd = (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, wait. Let me see. The number of stars in a shell at distance d is 4πd² * (number density) * dd. So N ∝ d² dd. But since d = 1/p, and dd = (1/p²) dp, substituting gives N ∝ (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 1/p^4 dp. So per unit parallax range (dp), the number of stars is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So for a small range dp, the number N is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit parallax (dN/dp) would be ~ 1/p^4.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax". So for a small dp, the number is proportional to 1/p^4. So the function would be N ∝ 1/p^4. So as p increases (meaning stars are farther away), the number per unit parallax decreases.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which would match. Option B is 1/(plx squared), D is 1/(cubed), C is 1/(linear).

Wait, but I thought the number of stars in a shell is proportional to d². So since p is inverse of d, d squared is 1/p². So N ∝ 1/p² * something else. Wait, did I make a mistake in the substitution?

Wait, let's go again. The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, say n. So the number in a shell is n * 4πd² * dd. So N = n * 4π d² dd.

But we're trying to find N in terms of p. So p = 1/d --> d = 1/p. Then dd = derivative of d with respect to p. So d = 1/p --> dd = (-1/p²) dp. But since we're considering a range, we can take absolute values, so dd = (1/p²) dp.

So substituting back into N, we get:

N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in a range dp of parallax is N = k * (1/p^4) dp, where k is some constant.

Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So as p increases, the number decreases as 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which would be correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the distribution uniform in terms of volume? Because if the stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density is uniform. So the number of stars in a shell depends on the surface area (d²) and the thickness (dd). But wait, if they are uniformly distributed over the sky, does that mean their distances are uniformly distributed? Or their positions on the celestial sphere?

Wait, the question says "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." Wait, that's ambiguous. Does that mean their positions on the celestial sphere are uniform (same in all directions), but their distances could vary? Or does it mean their distances are uniform?

Oh, the question says "uniformly distributed in the sky." Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Because in the sky, the distribution refers to their angular positions, not their distances. So perhaps the angular distribution is uniform, but their distances could vary. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's read the question again: "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?"

So the question is about the change in number of stars per unit parallax range as a function of parallax. So perhaps the parallax is the independent variable, and for each parallax bin, how many stars are in that bin.

But the initial assumption is that the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, perhaps that means their distances are uniformly distributed. But uniform distribution of stars in the sky (as in, on the celestial sphere) would imply that their positions are random in angle, but their distances could be anything. So, perhaps it's a uniform distribution of distances.

Wait, no. If stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, it probably refers to their angular distribution, not their distance. So their distribution on the celestial sphere is uniform, but their distances could vary. But then, what determines the number of stars per parallax range?

Parallax is dependent on distance. So if stars are uniformly distributed in the sky (same density everywhere), but their distances are not, then the number of stars in a given parallax range would depend on how the distances translate into parallax.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of density. If the number density of stars is uniform (n is constant), then the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. So dV for a thin shell is 4πd² dd. So N = n *4π d² dd.

But since parallax p = 1/d, then d = 1/p, and dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the number of stars in a shell is N = n *4π (1/p²) (1/p²) dp = n*4π (1/p^4) dp.

Thus, N ∝ 1/p^4. So the number per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer would be A.

But wait, if the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, but not in space, perhaps their distance distribution is not uniform. For example, if more stars are closer, then higher parallax (smaller p) would have more stars.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's imagine two scenarios. Scenario 1: stars are uniformly distributed in space (so number density is same everywhere). Then, as we found, the number per unit parallax is ~1/p^4.

Scenario 2: stars are uniformly distributed in the sky but not in space. That is, their distances are random but their angular positions are uniform. But I don't know how that would affect the number of stars per parallax range. Because for a given parallax, you're integrating over all angles.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, which probably refers to their angular distribution. So if you have a uniform distribution on the celestial sphere, but at various distances, then for a given parallax (distance), the number of stars would depend on the volume element and the distance.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because the distance distribution is not given. The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, which I think refers to their angular distribution. So, the number of stars in a small solid angle (dΩ) and a small distance range (dd) would be n dΩ dd, where n is the number density.

But if they're uniformly distributed in the sky, that would mean the angular distribution is uniform, so the number of stars in a solid angle dΩ is proportional to dΩ. But when we're considering parallax, which is a function of distance, we need to integrate over all angles but a given distance.

Wait, maybe I should model this.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, their distribution in terms of angles is uniform. So the number of stars in a small solid angle dΩ and within a distance d to d+dd would be N = n * dΩ * dd.

But for a given parallax p, which is 1/d, the number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp would be the integral over all angles. Since the solid angle is 2π sinθ dθ dφ, and the distribution is uniform, perhaps the number is proportional to the surface area at distance d, which is 4π d². So, for a given d, the number of stars in a thin shell is proportional to d² dd. But since d = 1/p, that would give (1/p²) (1/p²) dp, leading back to 1/p^4.

Hmm, so the answer seems to be option A, ~1/p^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax, distance, and the distribution of stars in space.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Parallax and Distance**: Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). Thus, \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), and the thickness in distance \( dd \) relates to the thickness in parallax \( dp \) as \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \).

2. **Number of Stars in a Shell**: If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell and the thickness \( dd \). The surface area of the shell is \( 4\pi d^2 \), so the number of stars in the shell is \( N \propto d^2 \, dd \).

3. **Expressing \( N \) in Terms of Parallax**: Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into \( N \propto d^2 \, dd \), we get:
   \[
   N \propto \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) dp = \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
   \]
   This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

### Conclusion:
The number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~1/plx^4**
