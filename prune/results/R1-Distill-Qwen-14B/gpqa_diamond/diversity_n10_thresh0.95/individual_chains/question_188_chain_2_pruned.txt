Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal but the angles can be different. Wait, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh, right, so it's a special case where all three angles are equal, making it a rhombohedral or maybe even a cubic structure? Wait, no, cubic is when all angles are 90 degrees. So this is a rhombohedral with 30 degree angles.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the structure factor vector. The formula is d_hkl = 1/(sqrt((h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - 2(hk cos gamma)/(a^2) - 2(hl cos beta)/(a^2) - 2(kl cos alpha)/(a^2)) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should recall the布拉格方程 (Bragg's equation) but no, that's for diffraction. The interplanar distance is more about the spacing between planes. Oh right, for cubic systems, there's a simple formula, but rhombohedral is a bit more complicated because of the angles.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by:

1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - 2hk cos gamma/(a b) - 2hl cos beta/(a c) - 2kl cos alpha/(b c)

But in this case, the crystal is rhombohedral, so a = b = c = 10 Angstrom. And all angles are 30 degrees. So alpha = beta = gamma = 30°, which is 30 degrees. So substituting these values in, since a = b = c.

So let's plug that into the formula. For the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting:

1/d^2 = (1^2)/(10^2) + (1^2)/(10^2) + (1^2)/(10^2) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30°)/(10*10) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30°)/(10*10) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30°)/(10*10)

Wait, because a = b = c, the denominator terms for cos terms become a*b, a*c, etc., which are all a^2 since a=b=c.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, the sum of squares terms:

(1/100) + (1/100) + (1/100) = 3/100.

Then the terms with cos:

Each is -2*(1)(1)*cos(30°)/(10*10) = -2*(cos(30°)/100). Since there are three such terms, each for hk, hl, kl.

So each term is -2*(1)(1) cos30/(10^2) = -2 cos30/(100).

So three terms: 3 * [ (-2 cos30) / 100 ] = -6 cos30 / 100.

Putting it all together:

1/d² = (3/100) + (-6 cos30 / 100 )

Factor out 1/100:

1/d² = (3 - 6 cos30) / 100

Compute the numerator: 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) because cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 3 - 6*(0.866) = 3 - 5.196 = approximately -2.196.

Wait, but that would make 1/d² negative, which can't be right because d is a distance and must be real. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses cos(alpha), where alpha is the angle between a and b, beta between a and c, and gamma between b and c. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are same, so it's symmetric. So perhaps the formula is correct, but I might have messed up the signs.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2 hk cos gamma/(a²) - 2 hl cos beta/(a²) - 2 kl cos alpha/(a²)

Wait, no, but in a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of the hexagonal system? Or no. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, rhombohedral is a special case of the cubic system, but with angles not 90 degrees. So the formula should be correct.

Wait, but if all the angles are 30°, and a=b=c=10, then let's recomputer.

So 1/d² = [ (1 + 1 + 1) ]/(10^2) - 2*(1*1 cos30)/(10^2) - 2*(1*1 cos30)/(10^2) - 2*(1*1 cos30)/(10^2)

Wait, that's (3/100) - [2 cos30 + 2 cos30 + 2 cos30]/(100)

Which is 3/100 - (6 cos30)/100.

So 3 - 6*(√3/2) all over 100.

√3 is about 1.732, so √3/2 is about 0.866. 6*0.866=5.196.

3 -5.196 = -2.196.

So 1/d² = (-2.196)/100 = -0.02196.

But that's negative, which can't be. That can't be right because d^2 can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system, which can be simplified because a = b = c.

Wait, maybe another approach. In a rhombohedral system, the lattice can be described using vectors, and the interplanar distance can be found using the scalar product.

The general formula for the interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cos gamma - 2 h l cos beta - 2 k l cos alpha )

Wait wait, but since all angles are 30°, and a = b = c, perhaps the formula can be simplified.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos γ )

But wait, in rhombohedral, perhaps the angle between a and b is alpha, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is gamma. So considering that, but when all angles are 30°, and a=b=c.

So in our case, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so all the cosine terms are cos30.

So plugging h=k=l=1.

So denominator is sqrt( 1+1+1 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30*3 ).

Wait, because each term: -2 hk cos alpha, but since h=k=l=1, each term is -2 cos30. There are three such terms because hk, hl, kl.

So denominator is sqrt(3 - 6 cos30°).

Compute that.

cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 = 5.196.

3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

So sqrt(-2.196) is imaginary. That's impossible. So this suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or the calculation is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I remembered the formula incorrectly. Maybe the denominator is h² + k² + l² + ... ?

Wait, alternative approach: in a rhombohedral lattice with a=b=c and angles alpha=beta=gamma=θ, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cosθ - 2 hl cosθ - 2 kl cosθ )

Wait, but that's what I used earlier. So with h=k=l=1, θ=30°, a=10.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Which is sqrt(3 - 3 sqrt(3)).

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3 sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196. So 3 -5.196 ≈ -2.196.

Which is negative, so sqrt of negative number isn't possible. That's a problem.

Hmm, so perhaps the formula is different when the angles are all the same.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ + 2(h^2 +k^2 + l^2) (1 - cosθ) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm mixing up formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a hexagonal system? Wait, rhombohedral is sometimes treated as a special case of hexagonal? Or not.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is that the (111) planes aren't allowed in a rhombohedral system because of the angles. But no, that's not correct. (111) planes are definitely present.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me check.

Another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula derived from the unit cell vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are involved. The plane (hkl) corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vector (h, k, l).

The interplanar distance d is 2π divided by the magnitude of the reciprocal vector.

The reciprocal vector magnitude is sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - 2 h k cos gamma/(a b) - 2 h l cos beta/(a c) - 2 k l cos alpha/(b c) )

Wait, but in rhombohedral, a = b = c, so all denominators are a^2. So the formula becomes:

sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/a^2 - 2hk cos alpha/a² - 2hl cos beta/a² - 2 kl cos gamma/a² )

Which can be written as sqrt( [ h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cos alpha - 2 h l cos beta - 2 k l cos gamma ] ) / a.

Wait, but then since alpha, beta, gamma are the angles between the respective axes, which in rhombohedral are all 30 degrees.

So plugging in h=k=l=1:

Denominator inside sqrt is 1+1+1 - 2*(1)(1) cos30 - 2*(1)(1) cos30 - 2*(1)(1) cos30.

Which is 3 - 2*(3) cos30 = 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 -3 sqrt(3) ≈ 3-5.196≈-2.196.

Which is negative. That's a problem. So the square root of a negative number is imaginary, which can't be right. So this suggests that perhaps the (111) planes are not possible in a rhombohedral structure with these angles?

But that can't be right. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe there's a different approach. In a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl)
