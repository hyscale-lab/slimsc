Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, wait, okay. Let me first understand the operator. The matrix A is 2x2, since we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states. So the matrix would look like this:

[A_11 A_12]
[A_21 A_22]

But according to the given, A_ij is 0 if i = j, else hbar/2. So A_11 = 0, A_22=0. A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2.

So the matrix is:
[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2 0     ]

Wait, that's the matrix for the spin operator in the x-direction, but scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], so multiplying by hbar/2 makes it (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

So the operator is (hbar/2) σ_x. That might be helpful.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the measurements would be corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, but the state is given in terms of |up> and |down>, the z-basis states. So I need to express |alpha> in the x-basis, or find the probabilities of measuring +x and -x.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is A = (hbar/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). So, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think again. The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1. So when we multiply by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So, the operator's eigenstates are the same as σ_x’s, which are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the problem is probably asking for the probability of measuring +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 when measuring this operator.

But first, I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional to something.

The state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

So, let's compute the normalization. The state is a vector in a 2D space; its norm squared is the sum of the magnitudes squared of each component.

The components are (1+i) and (2 - i).

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, to find the probabilities of the operator's eigenstates, we need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A (i.e., the x-basis).

Alternatively, we can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A, then square the magnitudes to get the probabilities.

So, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | alpha > = [ (1)(1*) + (1)(1*) ) / sqrt(2) ] for the |up> part and [ (1)(2*) + (1)(-i)(-1*) ) ] Wait, perhaps more clearly:

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the bra vector is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So,

< +x | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ) ]

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * 1/sqrt(2)

= [ (1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(7) ] * 1/sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator: 1+2 =3, i -i=0. So numerator is 3.

So this becomes (3)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the probability of measuring +x is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute the inner product with |-x>:

< -x | alpha > = [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ) ]

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * 1/sqrt(2)

= [ (1+i -2 +i) / sqrt(7) ] * 1/sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator: (1-2)= -1, i +i=2i. So numerator: (-1 +2i).

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability is the square of the magnitude: | (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14) |^2.

Calculate the magnitude squared: ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. So our probabilities are about 64% and 36%.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation. Because sometimes I might have messed up a step.

Wait, when I compute < +x | alpha >, I had 3/sqrt(14), which squared is 9/14 ≈0.6428, which is about 0.64, which is option A.

But let me check the other parts of the problem. The average value of the operator.

The operator is A, which has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The average value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, and |alpha> is a spin state, <A> is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in state |alpha>.

Hmm, another approach: in the z-basis, the state |alpha> is a vector with components [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

The operator A is represented as [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So matrix A is 2x2 with 0s on diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

So, <A> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, no, the outer product would be a row vector times A times a column vector.

Let me compute it.

Let me write the vector as a column vector: ψ = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, A = (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

So, A ψ is (hbar/2) times [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ; (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, ψ† A ψ is the conjugate transpose of ψ times A ψ.

The conjugate transpose of ψ would be [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So,

ψ† A ψ = (hbar/2) * [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7); (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiply the vectors:

= (hbar/2) * [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] / 7.

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1 -i)(2 - i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2-3i -1= 1-3i.

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2i + i*1 + i*i = 2 + 2i +i + (-1) = (2-1) + (3i) = 1 +3i.

Adding the two terms: (1-3i) + (1+3i) ) = 2.

So,

ψ† A ψ = (hbar/2) * (2)/7 = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar /7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7. That matches.

Wait, but let me check again the probabilities. Because sometimes when I compute inner products, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, in the first calculation, the inner product with |+x> was 3/sqrt(14), which gives probability 9/14≈0.6428, which is approximately 0.64, which matches option A.

But wait, let me think again. The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by sqrt(7). So the components are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Another way to compute the expectation value is using the operator in the x-direction. Since the operator is proportional to σ_x, the expectation value would be (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in |alpha>.

The expectation value of
