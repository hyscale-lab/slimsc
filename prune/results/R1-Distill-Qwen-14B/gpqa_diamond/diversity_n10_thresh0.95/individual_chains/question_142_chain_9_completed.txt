Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm more familiar with pure states being represented by density matrices like |ψ><ψ|, but here it's a mixture of |0> and |1> states.

So, the question is about the geometrical position. Geometric representation of qubits... Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation. Qubits can be represented as points on a unit sphere, right? But wait, this is a density matrix, which could represent a mixed state. So the Bloch vector might come into play here.

Density matrices for single-qubit states can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r determines the position on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state, r has length 1, and for a mixed state, it's shorter than 1. If r is zero, then ρ is the completely mixed state, which is (I)/2.

Wait, let me look at the given ρ again. It's (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute each term. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in the bottom right. Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1's on both diagonal elements. Multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal entry is 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with [0.5, 0; 0, 0.5]. That's the identity matrix multiplied by 0.5, right? Because I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so 0.5 I is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]].

So ρ is (I)/2. According to the general form, that would mean r·σ = 0, so r is the zero vector. Because when r is zero, ρ = (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). So the point is at the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another way to think about it is that this density matrix represents a completely mixed state. In a qubit system, the completely mixed state doesn't have any preferred direction—it's maximally uncertain. Which in the Bloch sphere, that corresponds to the center, which is the origin. So yeah, r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, a general single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\vec{r}\) is the Bloch vector and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), the term \(\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}\) is zero because \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\). This implies that \(\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
