Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should recall what stability constants mean. Stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So each β corresponds to a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands.

Wait, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) complexes. So n=1, 2, 3, 4 for the different β values. The blue complexes are likely the ones with two SCN- ligands, maybe Co(SCN)_2^0? Or wait, the question says dithiocyanato, which would be two SCN ligands, right? So that would be the second complex, n=2, β2=40.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue ones. So I need to find the fraction of Co in the form of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 species.

To find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the distribution of each species in solution. Since the solution is in equilibrium, each complex will form based on the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^- and the stability constants.

The approach I remember is using the formation of complexes step by step, considering each possible complex. So the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: Co^2+ (free), Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)_2^0, Co(SCN)_3^- (n=3), and Co(SCN)_4^2- (n=4). 

Wait, wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So for each complex, the formation can be written as:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)^+ with β1 = [Co(SCN)^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9

Similarly,

Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2^0 with β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([Co(SCN)^+][SCN^-]) =40

And so on for β3 and β4.

But wait, sometimes the overall formation constant is considered for each complex. For example, the formation constant for Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) is βn. So the first complex (n=1) has β1=9, the second (n=2) has β2=40, etc.

But to find the concentrations of each species, I think we can model this using the stepwise formation constants.

Let me think. One way to approach this is to express each species in terms of the free Co^2+ and the ligand concentration, using the β values.

But since [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration, assuming that the ligand is in excess, so [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M throughout.

Wait, but the total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So SCN is in large excess. So maybe we can approximate that adding a ligand doesn't change its concentration much. That would simplify the calculations.

So, the idea is to express each species' concentration in terms of [Co^2+] and the β's, and then sum all the species to find the fraction that is the dithiocyanato complex.

Let me outline the approach:

1. Let [Co^2+] = x.

2. Then, [Co(SCN)^+] = x * β1 * [SCN^-]

3. [Co(SCN)_2^0] = x * β1 * β2 * [SCN^-]^2

4. [Co(SCN)_3^-] = x * β1 * β2 * β3 * [SCN^-]^3

5. [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = x * β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * [SCN^-]^4

But wait, no. Wait, each subsequent β is for adding another SCN-. So for each step, the next β is multiplied.

Wait, another approach: The overall formation constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise β's up to that point.

So, the first complex (n=1) has K1 = β1 =9.

The second complex (n=2) has K2 = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

The third (n=3) has K3 = β1 β2 β3 =9*40*63=22680.

The fourth (n=4) has K4= β1 β2 β3 β4 =9*40*63*16= 362880.

But wait, is this correct? Because the stability constant for the n=2 complex is the product of the two stepwise β's. So yes, K2 = β1 * β2.

So each species' concentration can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

But wait, no. Because each complex is formed stepwise. So for each species Co(SCN)_n, the concentration is given by [Co^2+] * β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but actually, the correct expression for [CoL_n] is [Co^2+] * (β1 β2 ... βn) [L]^n.

So, for each species:

[Co] = x (free Co^2+)

[CoL] = x * β1 * [L] 

[CoL2] = x * β1 * β2 * [L]^2

[CoL3] = x * β1 β2 β3 [L]^3

[CoL4] = x * β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4

Then, the total cobalt is the sum of all these species plus the free Co^2+.

So,

Total Co = [Co] + [CoL] + [CoL2] + [CoL3] + [CoL4] = c_total = 1e-2 M.

But we can factor out x [since all terms have x].

So,

x [1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 ] = c_total.

We can compute the term inside the brackets.

Given [L] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term1: 1

Term2: β1 [L] =9 * 0.1=0.9

Term3: β1 β2 [L]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [L]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) * 0.001=22.68

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4= 9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Let's compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16= 362880.

Then, [L]^4 = (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are:

1 +0.9=1.9

+3.6=4.5

+22.68=27.18

+36.288=63.468.

So the sum is 63.468.

So,

x * 63.468 = c_total=0.01 M.

So x=0.01 /63.468 ≈ 0.0001575 M.

Wait, let's compute 0.01 divided by 63.468.

0.01 /63.468 = approx 1.575e-4 M.

Wait, 63.468 is about 63.5, so 0.01/63.5 ≈ 1.575e-4.

So x≈1.575e-4 M. That's the concentration of free Co^2+.

Now, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [CoL2]. 

[CoL2]=x * β1 beta2 [L]^2.

We can compute [CoL2] = x * 9 *40 * (0.1)^2.

Wait, but from earlier, we have [CoL2] = x * β1 β2 [L]^2 = x * 360 * 0.01 = x * 3.6.

But x is 1.575e-4, so [CoL2]=1.575e-4 *3.6= approx 5.67e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute that: 1.575e-4 *3.6 = (1.575 *3.6) e-4.

1.575 *3.6: 1.5 *3.6=5.4, and 0.075 *3.6=0.27. So 5.4+0.27=5.67.

So [CoL2]=5.67e-4 M.

But the total cobalt is 0.01 M, which is 1e-2 M.

So the fraction is [CoL2]/c_total = (5.67e-4) / (1e-2) ) = 0.0567, which is 5.67%.

Wait, but none of the options are 5.67%. The options are 42%, 25.6%, 38%, 16.9%.

Hmm, that's a problem. So clearly, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the terms.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum.

Compute each term:

Term1: 1.

Term2: β1 [L] =9 * 0.1 =0.9 → Sum so far:1.9.

Term3: β1 β2 [L]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 → 9*40=360, 360 *0.01=3.6 → Sum 4.5.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [L]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; *0.1^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001=22.68 → sum 27.18.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 =9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680*16= 362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6→4.5; +22.68→27.18; +36.288→63.468.

Wait, that's correct. So the sum is 63.468.

x= [Co^2+] =0.01 /63.468 ≈ 0.0001575 M.

Then, [CoL2]= x * β1 β2 [L]^2 = 0.0001575 * (9*40*(0.1)^2) → let's compute 9*40=360; (0.1)^2=0.01 → 360 *0.01=3.6.

So, [CoL2] =0.0001575 *3.6=0.000567 M.

Then, [CoL2]/c_total=0.000567 /0.01=0.0567 →5.67%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, wait, perhaps the β values are not cumulative. Wait, wait, maybe each β is for the entire complex, not step-wise.

Wait, no, I think the step-wise approach is correct. Because each βn is the formation constant for adding the nth ligand.

Another possibility: perhaps the complexes are Co(SCN)n^(2-n), and the charges are different, so perhaps the overall formation constants are different.

Wait another approach. Maybe the overall formation constant for the n=2 complex is β2 =40, not the stepwise. So for each complex, the formation constant is βn.

Wait, that would change the approach.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Stability constants can be either cumulative or stepwise. In this problem, since β1, β2, etc., are given, and their order is given as β1=9, β2=40, etc., it's likely that these are stepwise formation constants. So the first complex (n=1) has β1=9, the second (n=2) has a stepwise β2=40, so the overall K for n=2 is β1 * β2.

But wait, no. Wait, the stepwise formation constant is the constant for adding one ligand at a time. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_2 is β1 * β2.

So for [Co(SCN)_2], the formation constant is K2=β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

Similarly, for K3, it's β1 β2 β3=9*40*63= 22680.

So the approach I took earlier is correct.

But then why is my answer not matching any option? Maybe I miscalculated something.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of the sum.

Term1: 1.

Term2: 9 *0.1=0.9 → sum 1.9.

Term3: (9 *40) * (0.1)^2 →360 * 0.01=3.6 → sum 4.5.

Term4: (9*40*63) * (0.1)^3 → 22680 *0.001=22.68 → sum 27.18.

Term5: (9*40*63*16) * (0.1)^4 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288 → sum 63.468.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in considering which complex is blue. The problem says 'dithiocyanato' which is n=2. So [Co(SCN)_2^0] is the blue complex, and the question is about its percentage.

But according to my calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] is 5.67% of the total Co. But the options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the way I compute the concentrations. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: maybe considering that the complexes are formed in a way that each step is a separate reaction, and the concentrations are built using the stepwise βs.

Wait, another approach is to model the fraction of each species. Let me think of the distribution of Co among the different species.

The fraction f_n for each species is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So for the n=2 complex,

f_2 = (β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2) / sum_terms.

The sum_terms is the same as before, 63.468.

So,

β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6.

So f_2 =3.6 /63.468 ≈0.0567, or 5.67%, which is the same as before.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I've misunderstood the question.

Wait, the question says 'the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes', which is the n=2 complex. But perhaps I'm missing something about the complexes.

Another possibility: Perhaps the complexes for n=1 and n=2 are blue, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is n=4. No, wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands, so n=2.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in computing the sum. Let me recompute.

Compute each term:

- [Co^2+] = x.

- [CoL] =x β1 [L]

- [CoL2]=x β1 β2 [L]^2

- [CoL3]=x β1 β2 β3 [L]^3

- [CoL4]=x β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4

So,

total =x (1 + β1 L + β1 β2 L^2 + β1 β2 β3 L^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 L^4 )

Which is same as before.

Wait, perhaps the β4 is given as 16, but maybe the fourth complex has a higher or different β? Let me recheck the β values.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That's unusual, but perhaps that's correct.

But then, when we compute the fifth term, it's beta1*beta2*beta3*beta4 * L^4.

Which is 9 *40 *63 *16 = let me compute that again.

9*40=360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16=362880.

Yes, correct.

Wait, but perhaps the [SCN^-] is not 0.1 M. No, the problem states it's 0.1 M.

Hmm. Maybe I have to consider that the sum of the concentrations of all species equals c(Co)=1e-2 M.

Wait, let me compute the sum of the species:

sum = 1 +0.9 +3.6+22.68 +36.288 =63.468.

So, x= [Co^2+]=0.01 /63.468= approx 1.575e-4 M.

Then,

[CoL2]= x * (9*40*0.1^2) = x *360 *0.01= x *3.6.

x=1.575e-4 → 1.575e-4 *3.6=5.67e-4 M.

So, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is 5.67e-4 M.

The total cobalt is 0.01 M, so percentage is (5.67e-4 / 0.01) *100 =5.67%.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fraction of each species relative to the free Co^2+.

Wait, no, the total is accounted for correctly.

Another possibility: Perhaps I should not include the free Co^2+ in the sum. But no, the total includes all species.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the exponents. Let me recheck the [L] terms.

[L]=0.1 M.

Term2: β1 [L] =9 *0.1=0.9 → correct.

Term3: β1 β2 [L]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6 → correct.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [L]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 22680 *0.001=22.68 → correct.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 → (9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880) * (0.0001) → 36.288 → correct.

So sum is 63.468; x=1.575e-4.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. My calculation leads to about 5.67%, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stepwise approach. Maybe the β's are cumulative, not stepwise. Let me try that.

If β1 is the overall K for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc.

So for n=1, K1=β1=9.

n=2, K2=β2=40.

n=3, K3=β3=63.

n=4, K4=β4=16.

If that's the case, the approach changes.

Then, the concentrations would be:

[Co^2+] =x.

[CoL] =x K1 [L].

[CoL2] =x K2 [L]^2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if K1 is the overall for n=1, then [CoL] =x K1 [L].

But for K2, the overall for n=2, [CoL2] =x K2 [L]^2.

But that leads to:

sum =x (1 + K1 [L] + K2 [L]^2 + K3 [L]^3 + K4 [L]^4 )

Which would change the calculations.

So let's compute with that assumption.

Compute each term:

Term1:1.

Term2: K1 [L] =9 *0.1=0.9 → sum 1.9.

Term3: K2 [L]^2=40 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4 → sum 2.3.

Term4: K3 [L]^3=63 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063 → sum 2.363.

Term5: K4 [L]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So sum_terms=2.3646.

x=0.01 /2.3646≈4.225e-3 M.

Then, [CoL2]=x * K2 [L]^2 =4.225e-3 *40 *0.01=4.225e-3 *0.4=0.00169 M.

Then, [CoL2]/c_total= (0.00169)/0.01 =0.169 → 16.9%.

Hmm, that gives option D)16.9%.

But earlier, I thought the β's were stepwise, but if they're overall, that gives an option D, which is present.

Wait, but how to decide whether the β's are stepwise or overall? The problem states that they are 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16.'

Stability constants for the complexes are typically stepwise. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, β2 is the stepwise for the second, etc.

But in some cases, the overall formation constant (cumulative) is given. So how do I know which one applies here?

Hmm. The way the question is phrased: 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So βn is the stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

Wait, that would imply that βn is the overall K for each complex. So for n=1, K=9; n=2, K=40, etc.

If that's the case, then the approach would be as I did in the second case, leading to 16.9%, which is option D.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought βn are stepwise, but perhaps in this case, they are overall.

So let me reevaluate.

If each βn is the overall K for the complex with n ligands, then the concentrations are:

[Co]=x.

[CoL]=x K1 [L].

[CoL2]=x K2 [L]^2.

[CoL3]=x K3 [L]^3.

[CoL4]=x K4 [L]^4.

Then total =x (1 + K1 [L] + K2 [L]^2 + K3 [L]^3 + K4 [L]^4 )

Compute each term with given K's:

K1=9, [L]=0.1 → K1 [L]=0.9 → term2=0.9.

K2=40 → K2 [L]^2=40*(0.01)=0.4 → term3=0.4.

K3=63 →63*(0.001)=0.063 → term4=0.063.

K4=16 →16*(0.0001)=0.0016 → term5=0.0016.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

x= c_total / sum = 0.01 /2.3646 ≈4.225e-3 M.

Then [CoL2]=x * K2 [L]^2 =4.225e-3 *40 *0.01 =4.225e-3 *0.4=0.00169 M.

Percentage: (0.00169 /0.01)*100=16.9%.

Which is option D.

So perhaps the β's are the overall stability constants, not the stepwise.

But in some textbooks, the stability constants (β) are given as the overall (cumulative) constants. So if that's the case, then this approach is correct.

But I'm a bit uncertain because the way β's are usually presented as stepwise, but perhaps not always.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β's are the formation constants for each step. So β1=9 is for the first step, β2=40 for the second, etc.

In that case, the earlier approach gives a result not among the options, which suggests that perhaps the question expects the β's to be cumulative.

But then, why would the β4 be lower than β3? Because in reality, each stepwise β would be at least as big as the previous, but β4=16 is lower than β3=63.

Hmm, that's a problem. If β4 is lower, the fourth complex might not form as much as the third.

But in the earlier approach with stepwise β's, [CoL4]= x * β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4= x *9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Which would be x *362880 *0.0001= x *36.288.

But if β4 is smaller than β3, it's possible that the fourth complex is less populated.

Wait, but perhaps the complexes beyond n=3 aren't favored. Let me think about the possibility.

But regardless, in the first approach, the [CoL2] was 5.67%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat the β's as overall, leading to option D.

But why would the β4 be smaller than β3?

Alternatively, perhaps the given β values are the log β's? No, the question says the stability constants are β1=9, etc. So they are given as actual constants, not logs.

Another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which could include higher complexes, but the question says 'dithiocyanato', which is two SCN ligands, so that's only n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as using the formation of the first complex and the second, but not beyond.

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo, and the β4 is higher, but given as 16, which is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the ligand concentration is high, the higher complexes could form more, but in this case, [L]=0.1 M.

Wait, but in the first approach, the sum of the terms is 63.468, which is much larger, leading to a small x and a small [CoL2].

But perhaps the correct approach is to use the stepwise beta's for each complex, but then the problem is that the answer is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the fraction of each species using the distribution equation.

Another approach: The fraction of the n=2 complex is (β1 β2 [L]^2) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 )

Which in this case would be 3.6 /63.468=5.67%, but that's not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the formation of the first two complexes, but not the rest.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the first complex, but no, it's about dithiocyanato.

Wait, maybe the question is considering only the first two complexes, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the β values in a different way.

An alternative approach: compute the fraction of each possible complex using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n ) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n )

But in this case, the denominator would be sum up to n=4.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering up to n=3, but the problem states n=4.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake, but since the options include 16.9% (option D), which matches the approach when the β's are considered overall, perhaps that's the intended approach.

So, I think the answer is D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species in the solution. The total cobalt concentration is given as \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants (\( \beta \)) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are provided: \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. The stability constants (\( \beta \)) are treated as **overall (cumulative) stability constants** for the complexes, rather than stepwise formation constants. This means:
   - \( \beta_1 \) corresponds to the complex \([Co(\text{SCN})]\),
   - \( \beta_2 \) corresponds to \([Co(\text{SCN})_2]\),
   - \( \beta_3 \) corresponds to \([Co(\text{SCN})_3]\),
   - \( \beta_4 \) corresponds to \([Co(\text{SCN})_4]\).

2. The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species: free cobalt (\([Co^{2+}]\)), \([Co(\text{SCN})]\), \([Co(\text{SCN})_2]\), \([Co(\text{SCN})_3]\), and \([Co(\text{SCN})_4]\). The fraction of cobalt in each species is proportional to the product of the stability constant and the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands.

3. The fraction of cobalt in the dithiocyanato complex (\([Co(\text{SCN})_2]\)) is given by:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
   \]

### Calculations:
1. Compute each term in the denominator:
   - \( 1 \)
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

   Summing these terms gives:
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

2. Compute the numerator for \( f_2 \):
   \[
   \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 0.4
   \]

3. The fraction of cobalt in the dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

4. Convert this fraction to a percentage:
   \[
   f_2 \cdot 100 = 0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
