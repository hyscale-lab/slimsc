Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their velocities. Oh right, because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical addition. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically.

The formula for adding velocities in relativity is (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1*v2)/c²), right? But wait, in this case, I think one astronaut is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.6c, what's the speed of the other astronaut?

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, wait. Because both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed isn't simply the difference. Let me get this straight. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. From A's frame, how fast is B moving?

Wait a second, no. Because in the same direction, it's like, B is moving slower than A from the perspective of A. So the relative speed would be the difference, but with relativistic considerations. Oh, right. So I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula where u is the velocity of B as seen from A's frame.

So the formula is u = (v - u')/(1 - (v u')/c²), where v is the velocity of the frame (A's velocity relative to the rest frame), and u' is the velocity of B in the rest frame. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I've read that the relative speed formula when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Wait, no, perhaps I should consider the frame of reference. Let me set up the problem.

Let's consider the rest frame (say, S) where astronaut B is moving at 0.5c and astronaut A is moving at 0.6c. But wait, no, the problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction, but in the same rest frame? Or is each astronaut in their own frame? Hmm, I think the problem is in the same frame of reference. Wait, no, the question is about their relative speed, so we have to find the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

Right, so let's say we are in the rest frame of astronaut A. So A is at rest, and B is moving at velocity v. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, no. Wait, in the rest frame S, A is moving at 0.6c and B is moving at 0.5c. But in reality, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative velocity is actually the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the relative velocity using the formula. The formula for the relative velocity u is (v - u') / (1 - (v u')/(c²)), where u' is the velocity of B in the rest frame, and v is the velocity of A in the rest frame.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. For the relative velocity, from A's frame, B's velocity would be (B's velocity - A's velocity) / (1 - (B's velocity * A's velocity)/c²). So since both are moving in the same direction, and from the rest frame, A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c in the opposite direction. But wait, that's the classical way, but relativity doesn't allow speeds exceeding c, so I can't just subtract.

Wait, but in reality, according to the velocity addition formula, if in frame S (the rest frame), object A is moving at v = 0.6c, and object B is moving at u' = 0.5c (both in the same x-direction), then from A's frame (which is moving at v = 0.6c relative to S), the speed of B is u = (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/c²).

Wait, no, no. Wait, in the S frame, the velocity of A is v = 0.6c. The velocity of B is u' = 0.5c. So from A's frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to S, the velocity of B (u) is given by u = (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/(c²)).

Wait, that makes sense. Because in A's frame, the S frame is moving at -v, right? So the velocity of B in A's frame is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/c²).

So plugging the numbers in:

u = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So numerator is -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.5 * 0.6 c²)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3) = 0.7.

So u = (-0.1 c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.14286 c.

Wait, but speed is the magnitude, so the relative speed is 0.14286 c. Wait, but wait—the options have 0.14c as an option, like in option C and D.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14286 c, which is about 0.14c, so 0.14c.

So that aligns with the options C and D.

Now for the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts.

Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c². So for each, I need to compute gamma.

The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c:

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A: Gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B, mass 3m, moving at 0.5c:

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = approx 1.1547.

So energy of B: Gamma_B * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc^2, which matches.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options:

Option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the rest energy? Oh, no, because each is moving, their energy is their relativistic energy, which includes their kinetic energy plus rest energy. So adding those two gives the total energy of the system.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{v u}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \(v = 0.6c\) (velocity of astronaut A in the rest frame),
- \(u = 0.5c\) (velocity of astronaut B in the rest frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.14286c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is the magnitude. Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
- Mass: \(2m\),
- Velocity: \(0.6c\).

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
- Mass: \(3m\),
- Velocity: \(0.5c\).

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
