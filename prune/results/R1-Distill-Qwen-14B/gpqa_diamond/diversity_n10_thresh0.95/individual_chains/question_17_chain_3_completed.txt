Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, right, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ into a complex. The formation constant (Kf) tells us how stable the complex is. A larger K means the complex is more stable.

So the complex here is Ca-EDTA. The formula for the complex would be CaY²–, where Y is EDTA. I think the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ↔ CaEDTA²–. The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA²–]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]).

Wait, but in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, without any dissociation, the concentration of Ca²+ would be 0.02 M, but that's probably not the case because the complex can dissociate. So I need to calculate the actual concentration when considering the dissociation.

Since Kf is very large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation isn't much. But wait, if Kf is large, the denominator [Ca²+][EDTA] should be small, which would mean that [Ca²+] is small. Because Kf = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]).

But wait, the solution is just the complex, right? So initially, [CaEDTA²–] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA⁴–] are zero, but that can't be. Oh, no, actually, considering the dissociation, the complex will dissociate a little.

Let me set up an ICE table. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA would also be x, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one of EDTA.

So, initial concentrations:

[CaEDTA²–] = 0.02 M

[Ca²+] = 0

[EDTA⁴–] = 0

Change:

[CaEDTA²–] decreases by x, so becomes 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is probably very small).

[Ca²+] increases by x → x.

[EDTA⁴–] increases by x → x.

So, the equilibrium expression is:

Kf = (0.02 - x)/(x * x) ≈ 0.02 / x²

Because x is very small compared to 0.02.

So Kf = 5e10 ≈ 0.02 / x² → x² ≈ 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, let me calculate that correctly.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, but 2e-6.5 would be more like 3.16e-7 because 1e-6.5 is ~3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. Hmm, that's about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this calculation. So the concentration of calcium ions would be approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me redo the algebra.

Kf = 5e10 = [CaEDTA²–]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴–]).

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA²–] is almost 0.02 M, so approx 0.02.

So 5e10 ≈ 0.02 / (x^2).

So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, wait. 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. So sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. So yes, x is 2e-6.5 M.

But 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 would be somewhere in between. Let me calculate 1e-6.5.

1e-6 is 0.000001, 1e-7 is 0.0000001. 6.5 is halfway between 6 and 7? No, wait, 6.5 is between 6 and 7, but exponents are on a log scale. Wait, 10^-6.5 is equal to 10^(-6 -0.5) = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 = 1e-6 * (1 / sqrt(10)) ≈ 1e-6 / 3.162 ≈ 3.16e-7.

So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Yes, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches. So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

Here, \( K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]} \). Initially, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\), denoted as \(x\). At equilibrium, \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since \(x\) is very small compared to 0.02 M), and \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x\).

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
