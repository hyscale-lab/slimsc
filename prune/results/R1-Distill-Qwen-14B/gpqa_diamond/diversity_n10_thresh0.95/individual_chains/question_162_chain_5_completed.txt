Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that metrics usually describe the geometry of spacetime, but here it's probably a two-dimensional space because I see dx and dy. So this is a 2D metric, maybe part of a larger spacetime like AdS or something else.

I think pseudosphere refers to a surface with constant negative curvature. Oh right, in 2D, a pseudosphere is a surface with hyperbolic geometry, which has a curvature that's negative everywhere. The area of a pseudosphere... wait, I'm trying to recall. The area of a sphere is 4πr², but for a pseudosphere? Or wait, maybe in this context, it's about the area in the metric provided.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. How does the metric relate to the radius? Let me see, the denominator has (4 - x² - y²), which looks a bit like (r² - a²), where r is the radius in 3D, but here it's 2D.

Wait, maybe the metric is conformally flat. The conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the line element is scaled by this factor compared to the flat metric (dx² + dy²).

In two dimensions, the area element would be sqrt(-g) d²x, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, g is the determinant of the matrix [g_xx, g_xy; g_yx, g_yy]. Since this is diagonal with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_xy = 0. So the determinant would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))², and the square root would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, 4 - x² - y² is in the denominator, which suggests that the metric blows up when x² + y² approaches 4. So maybe this is a model of hyperbolic space, where the radius is related to that 4. Let me think: the standard Poincaré disk model has a metric like (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²²)², but I'm not sure. Wait no, the Poincaré disk model is usually written with a different conformal factor. Hmm.

Wait, the area of the pseudosphere in hyperbolic geometry is actually infinite. Because a pseudosphere extends infinitely, right? Unlike a regular sphere, which has finite area. So if I'm calculating the area of the entire pseudosphere, it would be infinite. But wait, I'm not sure. How does this relate to the metric given?

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere here is a two-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the metric is that of a space with a certain curvature, and the area is computed using the metric's determinant.

Let me calculate the area. The area would be the integral over all x and y where the metric is defined. The metric is defined where 4 - x² - y² > 0, because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, which would make the metric singular or imaginary. So x² + y² < 4, which is the interior of a circle with radius 2. Ah, so this is the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space with radius 2. Because the Poincaré disk has a metric (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²²) where r is the radial coordinate in the disk, and the radius of the disk is the curvature radius. So in this metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²) which can be written as (4)(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So 4 is (2)^2, so the radius is 2.

Wait, the area of the Poincaré disk (which is a model of hyperbolic space) is infinite. Because even though the disk is finite in radius, the area element causes the area to be infinite. For example, the area element in the Poincaré disk model is (4/(4 - r²)^2) * r dr dθ. Integrating from r=0 to r=2 would give an integral that diverges. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but wait, the metric given is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y^2)] dx dy. The area would be the double integral over x and y where x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y^2)] dx dy.

Let me compute that. Let me switch to polar coordinates because x² + y² = r². So the integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dθ dr.

The integral over θ is 2π. So the area is 32 * 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [ r dr/(4 - r²) ) ]

Let me compute the radial integral. Let u =4 - r². Then du = -2r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ [ r dr ]/(4 - r²) = ∫ ( - du/2 ) / u = (-1/2) ln|u| + C. Evaluated from r=0 to r=2.

When r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So the integral is:

At r=2, u=0. The integral becomes (from u=4 to u=0) of (-1/2 ln u) evaluated between 4 and 0. Wait, when r=0, u=4. So the integral from r=0 to r=2 is from u=4 to u=0.

So ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ) ] from 0 to 2 is ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) ( (-1/2) du ) / u ) = (1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to 0) (du/u) ) = (1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, evaluating ln u from 4 to 0 would be ln 0 - ln 4. But ln 0 is negative infinity. So this integral diverges. That means the area is infinite. So the area is infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the correct answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. This is recognized as the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) ensures the metric is finite within the disk \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a radius of \(r = 2\). The area element in this metric is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor, which gives:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the entire disk. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\)), the area becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so:

\[
\text{Area} = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the radial integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u} = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \ln u \Big|_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, indicating that the total area is infinite. Thus, the area of the pseudosphere in this metric is \(+\infty\).

Answer: D
