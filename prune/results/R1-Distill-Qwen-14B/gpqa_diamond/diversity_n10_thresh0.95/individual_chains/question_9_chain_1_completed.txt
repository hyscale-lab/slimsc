Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h symmetry means it has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the notation for point groups can be a bit tricky. So, C3h is the same as the point group D3h, right? Or wait, D3h is a different group. Let me think. Oh no, wait. C3h is actually a subgroup of D3h. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. Point group C3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule's symmetry operations include a 120-degree rotation and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Wait, no, correction: C3h is a group that includes a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror (Ïƒh) plane. So, any molecule with this symmetry should have a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane that's horizontal relative to that axis.

Looking at the options, the molecules are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I need to figure out which one has C3h symmetry.

Let's go one by one.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a structure where the boron is connected to three isopropyl groups. The molecule is symmetric because all three substituents are the same. So, what's its point group? Well, the structure is trigonal, right? So with three identical groups around the central atom. So it should have a high degree of symmetry. Wait, for a molecule with three identical substituents around a central atom, like in BF3, it's trigonal planar and has D3h symmetry. Wait, but BF3 is D3h because it's planar, right? Triisopropyl borate would be similar. So if the substituents are all the same, the molecule might have D3h symmetry. But wait, D3h has multiple symmetry elements, including a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, as well as others. So if the molecule is planar, like maybe the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion, then yes, D3h.

But wait, for triisopropyl borate, the structure is more like B with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a bulky group. So the molecule might not be planar. Wait, but the B in borate typically has a trigonal planar structure. So triisopropyl borate would have the B in the center with three isopropyl groups arranged trigonally. So that should have a three-fold rotation axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, maybe I should think about the mirror planes. If the molecule is symmetric such that there's a horizontal mirror plane that bisects the molecule, reflecting it would leave it the same. So, for triisopropyl borate, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would exist. So that would make the point group D3h, which includes C3h.

Wait, but isn't C3h a lower symmetry than D3h. Or is C3h a different group? I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The C3h group has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. D3h includes that plus other symmetry elements, like vertical mirrors as well. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it automatically has C3h as a subgroup. So if a molecule has C3h symmetry, it's possible it has a higher symmetry like D3h, but the question is asking which has C3h, so perhaps it doesn't have any additional symmetry elements beyond that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, but no vertical mirrors. So which molecules fit that?

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, I think. It's a norbornane derivative, maybe? Wait, no. Quinuclidine is actually a bicyclic structure, a seven-membered ring, but I'm not fully sure. Wait, quinuclidine is a tricyclic molecule with a bridge. It's structure has a central bridge with three substituents. Wait, no, maybe I should draw it mentally. Quinuclidine has a structure where it's a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, I think. So it's a bridged bicyclic structure, perhaps with a three-fold axis.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[3.3.1] system, which is also known as adamantane? No, adamantane is different. Quinuclidine's structure is actually a bridged bicyclic amine. Its structure has a three-membered bridge, so perhaps it has a three-fold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, if quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane, then what's its point group? I'm trying to remember. Quinuclidine is known to have D3h symmetry because it's a symmetric molecule. So if it has D3h, then it also has C3h symmetry. So if that's the case, then option D would have C3h symmetry.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse the name. It's a benzo-fused trifuran with some ketone groups. The substituents are in specific positions. I think benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c''] refers to the fusion of benzene rings with the furan rings. So how symmetric is this molecule? Well, benzo derivatives can have certain symmetries. For example, benzene itself is D6h, but when fused with other rings, symmetry might decrease.

Wait, the molecule in option B has three ketone groups in the hexaone part. So positions 1,3,4,6,7,9 are ketones. Maybe that's a lot of substituents arranged symmetrically. If the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, that could contribute to C3h symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it's more symmetric than that.

But I'm not too confident. Let me think about the other options.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Triphenyleno suggests that the molecule has three benzene rings fused onto the trifuran structure. The numbering would be such that each benzene is attached at specific positions. Now, this molecule might have higher symmetry because of the symmetric arrangement of the substituents. But would that lead to C3h symmetry?

Alternatively, think about which of these structures is known to have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror.

Wait, triphenyleno... I think that structure might have a three-fold axis due to the way the benzene rings are fused. But without seeing the structure, it's a bit hard. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric enough to have C3h.

Wait, but let's think about the others.

Triisopropyl borate (option C): As I thought earlier, it's trigonal planar, so D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So this molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine (option D): D3h symmetry, so it definitely has C3h.

So both options C and D could have C3h. But wait, is C3h a subgroup of D3h? So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it must have C3h as well. So the question is which of the options has at least C3h symmetry.

So the question is, which of the options is in the C3h group.

Wait, but the question is which has C3h symmetry, not higher. So perhaps one of the options has exactly C3h and not a higher symmetry.

Alternatively, the others may have lower symmetry.

Wait, perhaps triisopropyl borate (option C) is more symmetric than C3h. Since it's a planar molecule with three identical substituents, it's probably D3h. So if the question is which has C3h, then perhaps the correct answer is one with exactly C3h.

Wait, but then the other options may have lower symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry. So perhaps the correct answer is D, quinuclidine, which has D3h symmetry, hence C3h as well.

Wait, but the question is about C3h. So any molecule with D3h has C3h. So if the options include a molecule with D3h symmetry, that would also have C3h.

Wait, but the question is which has C3h symmetry. So perhaps one of the other molecules has exactly C3h.

Hmm. Alternatively, let me think about the structures.

Triisopropyl borate is like B with three isopropyl groups, all identical, arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. So it's a planar molecule, which would have D3h symmetry because it's planar (so a horizontal mirror plane, which would be the plane perpendicular to the plane of the molecule) and a three-fold rotation axis.

Quinuclidine: I think it's a non-planar molecule, but with a three-fold rotation axis. For example, the structure may have three identical bridges, leading to a three-fold axis. But without a horizontal mirror plane, perhaps it's just C3. Or maybe it has a horizontal mirror.

Wait, if quinuclidine is a bicyclo[3.3.1] structure, then it's symmetric. For instance, the molecule might have a three-fold axis, and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis (a vertical mirror plane), but not a horizontal one. Or perhaps it has a horizontal mirror.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a three-fold axis but no mirror planes. But that can't be, because it's a symmetric molecule.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the answers.

The options are A, B, C, D.

The choices are:

A) triphenyleno... which has a complex ring system.

B) benzo... with three ketone groups.

C) triisopropyl borate.

D) quinuclidine.

Which has C3h.

I think that C3h symmetry can be found in molecules that have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So if the question is which has C3h, then C would have it.

But wait, the question is which has C3h symmetry, so any of the options that have at least C3h would be correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking which one is in the C3h point group, not higher.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is D3h (so higher symmetry than C3h), so the correct answer would be a molecule with exactly C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine is in C3h.

Wait, I'm not very confident, but I think quinuclidine has D3h symmetry. So that would include C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, I'm getting nowhere. Let me think of each option's structure.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

So, it's a benzo-fused trifuran (three furan rings?), with six ketone groups. Wait, no, the name says hexaone, so six carbonyl groups? Or positions 1,3,4,6,7,9 are carbonyls.

But arranging such a molecule, maybe it's a symmetric structure with a three-fold axis, but not a horizontal mirror. So maybe it's in C3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's in C3v or C3h.

Option A: triphenyleno... which suggests that three benzene rings are fused onto the trifuran. So, perhaps this molecule is more symmetric. Maybe it's in D3h.

Wait, but without the structure, it's hard to tell.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. As I thought earlier, it's D3h.

Option D: quinuclidine. It's a bridged bicyclic structure. I think its point group is D3h as well.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: Quinuclidine is a structure where the molecule has a three-fold axis, and a mirror plane. For example, in quinuclidine, each bridge is identical, so a three-fold rotation would map the molecule onto itself. Also, there's a mirror plane that bisects the molecule.

So, quinuclidine's point group is D3h, which includes a horizontal mirror plane.

If that's the case, then option D (quinuclidine) has C3h.

But so does triisopropyl borate (option C).

Wait, but the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, the correct answer could be either C or D, but I need to figure out which one.

Wait, but looking at the options, the user lists the options as A, B, C, D, with the choices given. The question is to pick one.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structures. Triphenyleno suggests that three benzene rings are fused onto the trifuran. If the trifuran is a central ring, with three benzene rings attached symmetrically, perhaps at each of the three positions, then that would lead to a three-fold axis, and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, perhaps option A has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure in option A is more symmetric. The name is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, the substituents are at 1,3,6,8,11,13, which suggests they are symmetrically placed.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

But I'm not very confident. Let me think again.

The molecules:

- Triphenyleno... (A) has three benzene rings attached to the trifuran in a symmetric way. So three-fold rotation and a mirror plane.

- Benzo... (B) has one benzene ring attached; perhaps not symmetric enough.

- Triisopropyl borate (C) has D3h symmetry, so it has C3h.

- Quinuclidine (D) has D3h symmetry, so has C3h.

So, if the question is which has C3h, then both C and D have it, but perhaps the correct answer is one of them.

But looking at the options, the question is which of the following has C3h symmetry. So all options except one might not have it. So perhaps only one of them has it.

Wait, perhaps triphenylene (A) is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about triisopropyl borate. Maybe it's not planar and doesn't have a horizontal mirror. So maybe it doesn't have C3h.

Wait, triisopropyl borate: each isopropyl group is a substituent on the B. If the molecule is trigonal planar, then it's planar, so a horizontal mirror would bisect it. But perhaps the substituents are so bulky that the molecule isn't planar, so it's not D3h but perhaps C3v or something else.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Boron is usually planar. So triisopropyl borate should have a planar structure, which would mean a horizontal mirror plane.

So, going back to the options, both C and D have C3h. But the answer options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, wait â€” the options list four choices, each being one of the four molecules. So the possible answers are:

A) triphenyleno...

B) benzo...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the options are the four molecules, the question is which one has C3h.

Now, I think triphenyleno's structure is more likely to have a three-fold axis but no horizontal mirror. Alternatively, perhaps it has a horizontal mirror.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry?

I know that triisopropyl borate is known to have D3h symmetry because it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So, that would have C3h.

Quinuclidine, I'm not so sure, but I think it's D3h as well.

So, if both C and D have C3h symmetry, but the question is asking which of the following has it, then perhaps both are correct. But the options are each one, so perhaps the correct answer is either C or D.

But the question is which one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A) triphenyleno...

B) benzo...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, perhaps only one of them has C3h.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because the other options don't have it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the actual structures.

Wait, I think triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... maybe this structure has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror. So that's C3h.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule in option A is in the C3v point group, which has a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but I think quinuclidine has D3h symmetry. So if the question is which has C3h, then both C and D would have it. So the answer must be one of them.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not certain about the symmetries of these molecules. But I'll make an educated guess.

Given that triisopropyl borate has a planar structure with three identical groups, it's D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So option C would have C3h.

If the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry, then option C is correct.

Wait, but wait. I've read that triisopropyl borate is not planar. Wait, no, that's not correct. The borate ion has a trigonal planar structure because boron has a spÂ² hybridization. So each isopropyl group is in a plane around the boron.

So, triisopropyl borate is planar, so it's D3h symmetry, hence has C3h.

So, if the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry, then triisopropyl borate (option C) would have it.

But I also thought that quinuclidine has D3h symmetry, so it also has C3h. So either C or D would be correct.

But the options are A, B, C, D. So the correct answer would be either C or D.

Wait, the options given are the four molecules, so I'm to pick one.

But perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structures again.

Option A: triphenyleno... that name suggests three benzene rings fused onto the trifuran. So imagine a central trifuran (three furan rings?), with three benzene rings attached at each of the three positions. So, the arrangement would be symmetric, perhaps leading to a three-fold rotation axis.

If the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h.

So, perhaps option A has C3h symmetry.

But without seeing the structure, it's hard to be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the other option is that the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine.

Wait, looking for another approach: I think quinuclidine is a well-known molecule with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, so D3h symmetry, which includes C3h.

So, that would mean option D has C3h.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mirror planes.

In triisopropyl borate (option C), the mirror plane is the plane perpendicular to the trigonal plane, so a horizontal mirror. So C3h is present.

In quinuclidine (option D), perhaps the mirror plane is vertical, so it's in C3v group, not C3h. So if it has a three-fold rotation and a vertical mirror, then it's C3v. But if it has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror, then it's C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, so D3h.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make a choice. I'll go with option C, triisopropyl borate, because it's a planar molecule with three identical substituents, leading to D3h symmetry, which includes C3h.


To determine which molecule has **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry involves a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒâ‚•). The analysis of each option is as follows:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three benzene rings fused symmetrically at specific positions. The arrangement of the substituents suggests a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ). Additionally, the molecule likely has a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒâ‚•), making it a candidate for **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry. However, the complexity of the fused ring system makes it less certain whether the molecule strictly adheres to **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry.

---

### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule features a benzo-fused trifuran structure with six ketone groups. The asymmetry introduced by the single benzene ring and the arrangement of the ketone groups likely disrupt the required symmetry for **Câ‚ƒh**. This option is unlikely to have **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry.

---

### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. Its planar structure and symmetry around the central boron atom give it **Dâ‚ƒh** symmetry, which includes **Câ‚ƒh** as a subgroup. Since **Câ‚ƒh** is a subset of **Dâ‚ƒh**, this molecule satisfies the criteria for **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry.

---

### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ). However, its symmetry elements are more consistent with **Dâ‚ƒh** symmetry, which includes additional mirror planes. While quinuclidine has **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry as a subgroup, it also has higher symmetry elements, making it less specific to **Câ‚ƒh** compared to triisopropyl borate.

---

### **Conclusion**
Both **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** and **quinuclidine (Option D)** have **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry. However, triisopropyl borate is more directly associated with **Câ‚ƒh** due to its simpler trigonal planar structure, which clearly exhibits the required symmetry elements without additional higher symmetry elements. Therefore, the best answer is **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
