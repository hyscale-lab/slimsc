--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what's going on.

So the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? Like a cage structure with multiple rings. So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure. 

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. In such conditions, especially with vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), I think an elimination reaction would occur. E2 elimination, probably, leading to the formation of an alkene. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, forming an adamantene with a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions. Wait, no. Wait, wait, the structure of adamantane is a bit tricky. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so the positions 1 and 3 would be on adjacent carbons but in a specific arrangement. So when the two Brs are removed, the double bond would form, resulting in an adamantylene structure. Since KOH in such reactions usually deprotonates and abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of the double bond.

The product 1 is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR spectrum shows four signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, IR peak at 1720 is carbonyl (C=O). But wait, if it's an elimination reaction, product 1 should be an alkene. But 1720 cm⁻¹ is more indicative of a ketone or maybe an ester. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I miss something?

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Another possibility is that KOH could cause a substitution reaction, but for a dibromide, substitution would form a diol. But that doesn’t fit with the IR peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's an E2 elimination to form a double bond, but the IR doesn’t show a peak for C=C. Wait, maybe the product is not an alkene but something else. Wait, wait, 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps the reaction is more about forming a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps the heating with KOH is causing a different kind of reaction. Maybe a Hofmann elimination or something else? Or, wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Oh wait, no. Alternatively, could it be a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then maybe another reaction. Wait, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane structure: Adamantane is a diamond-shaped molecule, so the 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent carbons. When KOH is used, perhaps it abstracts a hydrogen, leading to elimination of Br⁻ and formation of a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantylene? But that would be an alkene, right? So the IR should show a peak around 1650 cm⁻¹ for C=C. But the IR in the question is at 1720, which is more like a ketone.

Wait, could there be a ring-opening or some rearrangement? Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Let's see: KOH is a strong base but can also act as a nucleophile. In a vicinal dihalide, maybe it would substitute both bromines with hydroxyl groups, forming a diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Unless... Wait, maybe the diol is oxidized? No, because KOH is a base, and the product is formed under heating. Alternatively, maybe the diol is formed and then undergoes some elimination again. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the initial reaction is elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but how? Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization or some kind of keto-enol tautomerism? Not sure. Let me think about the NMR data.

The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a downfield shift, perhaps indicating some deshielded protons. Maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. If it's a diol, the protons would be on oxygen-bearing carbons. 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests maybe some methylene or methyl groups in a hydrocarbon environment. 1.94 ppm (2H) could be something else, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative group or part of a ring.

Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the product is an epoxide? No, because epoxides have different IR regions, usually around 1250 cm⁻¹ for C-O. Alternatively, a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, what would that mean for the structure?

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Hmm, that doesn't seem straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which upon elimination forms a cycloalkane with a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane? But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons, and eliminating two HBr's would form a conjugated diene or a single double bond, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate. The product's NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 (2H). That's a prominent signal. Maybe it's a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom. Like maybe an ether or an ester. Wait, but the IR is 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps it's an ester group. Or maybe a ketone.

Wait, another approach. Let's list the possibilities for the first reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Options: elimination to form alkene, substitution to form diol, or maybe some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening elimination. For example, if the adamantane has a bridge, perhaps the Brs are on bridgehead carbons. Eliminating two HBr would form a double bond, but in such a strained structure, perhaps it rearranges. Wait, though, adamantane is already a very rigid structure with high ring strain, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the first product is not an alkene but a ketone. Let me think: If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the KOH induces a substitution reaction, with each Br being replaced by an OH group, forming 1,3-diol adamantane. Then, when heated, the diol could undergo elimination (like a dehydration) to form an alkene. But that would require acid, though, not base. Hmm.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base like KOH, elimination is favored. So perhaps the initial reaction is elimination, forming a double bond, but then the product is an alkene. But why the IR shows 1720? Maybe I was wrong about the initial product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not just an alkene. Maybe it's a ketone because of some rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, it forms a conjugated diene. But that doesn't explain the IR.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look at the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But for that, the substrate needs to be an aromatic ring. Wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, but not aromatic. So perhaps the second step is a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but where?

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of acylation. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation typically uses an acyl chloride with AlCl3. Wait, but Al isopropoxide is Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid catalyst.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps in the second step, it undergoes some kind of alkylation or acylation. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, product 1's IR is at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, but if product 1 is an alkene, why the IR is 1720? That doesn't fit. So maybe the first reaction isn't elimination. Let me think about substitution again.

Wait, KOH could deprotonate and substitute. So if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the first reaction is a double substitution, replacing both Br with -OH groups, forming a diol. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be. Unless perhaps dehydration occurs in the presence of base? But that would form an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the diol formed is then oxidized. But in the presence of KOH and heat, perhaps it's more likely to undergo elimination than oxidation. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but I don't see how. Epoxides form from dihalides via an SN2 mechanism but usually with a peracid. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing some ring-opening. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The NMR of product 1 has a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a good hint. A singlet in NMR usually means no neighboring protons. So maybe those two protons are on a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Like maybe an ether group or a carbonyl group.

Wait, for example, a ketone would have a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 group. But in that case, the CH2 protons would be split based on neighboring groups. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the adjacent CH2 would be split.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 1, the 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet) could be part of a carbonyl group, like an ester. Let me think: If product 1 is an ester, that would explain the carbonyl in the IR. So how could 1,3-dibromoadamantane form an ester upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, that doesn't seem straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a cyclic ketone through some rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, epoxides would have a ring strain and appear as a singlet if the protons are equivalent. But the IR of epoxides typically shows the C-O-C stretching around 1250 cm⁻¹, not 1720, so that's not it.

Hmm, I'm stuck on product 1. Let me think about the IR again. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a carbonyl compound. But how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane lead to that?

Wait, perhaps the elimination produces a ketone. Let me imagine the structure. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, eliminating HBr from both would form a double bond. But how does that form a ketone? Maybe the double bond is in a position that allows for some keto-enol tautomerism. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the elimination isn't just a simple E2. Maybe it's a more complex process, like a ring-opening elimination. For example, if the bromines are on bridgehead positions, eliminating could lead to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an allene (conjugated diene) which can undergo some oxidation, but that's not likely under KOH conditions.

Wait, maybe the product is an alkyne. But the IR of an alkyne's C≡C is usually around 2100-2250 cm⁻¹, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base, and heating it with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, but forming a conjugated diene, which then undergoes some conjugate addition or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling reaction, but that's less likely.

Wait, another thought: Could it be that the product is a benzene ring with some substituents? No, because adamantane isn't aromatic, and I don't see any ring formation here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol? Hmm. Geminal diols are when two OH groups are on the same carbon. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so that's vicinal, not geminal. So substitution would form vicinal diol, not geminal.

Wait, maybe the KOH is in a different environment. For example, maybe it's a Williamson ether synthesis, but I don't see how that applies here.

I'm getting stuck on the first part. Maybe I should move to the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3.

Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. In the presence of dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive workup, the ozonide would break into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But wait, ozonolysis at -78°C usually leads to the formation of ozonides that upon workup give ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substituents around the double bond.

So let me think about product 2. If product 1 is a carbonyl compound, and product 2 is treated with Al isopropoxide, maybe product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of acetylenic compound. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enolate or something that can form a new double bond.

Wait, Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. But since the product 1 is a ketone (if that's the case), perhaps product 2 is an acetylation product. Wait, but without an aromatic ring, Friedel-Crafts wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide acts as a catalyst for some kind of elimination, forming a carbonyl. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkene, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, some kind of addition occurs, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the second step is forming an acetylenic compound. So, product 2 would be an alkyne. Then, ozonolysis of an alkyne would give different products, like diketones or other structures.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the final NMR. Product 3's NMR is asked for, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

So, product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis tends to break double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But the exact structure of product 2 is unclear to me right now. Let me try to figure out what product 1 is.

Wait, another approach. Let's try to think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet) could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests a lot of protons in a similar environment, perhaps from multiple equivalent methylene or methyl groups in a ring structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another methylene group, perhaps adjacent to the oxygen-bearing CH2.

If product 1 is a ketone, the 4.79 ppm (2H) would be a CH2 next to the carbonyl. So for example, structure like (CH2)2CO. But in a larger adamantane structure, that could fit.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then the next step is treating with Al isopropoxide. Maybe that induces some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing a Claisen or aldol condensation? But without an alpha hydrogen, the ketone might not undergo aldol. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming an acetal, but that would require a diol.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me think again.

The IR of product 1 shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 is a carbonyl compound. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which implies that these two protons are on a CH2 group with no neighboring protons. So perhaps they're on a carbonyl group, like an ester (COOCH2CH3), but the singlet suggests no adjacent Hs.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone. For example, a cyclohexanone derivative. So the 4.79 ppm (2H) might be a bridgehead CH2 group adjacent to the ketone. But in adamantane, the structure is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But then, the NMR would show more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but the IR doesn't fit. I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the starting material and possible elimination. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. Upon elimination of two HBr molecules, it would form a double bond. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantylene. The IR of an alkene typically shows peaks around 1650 cm⁻¹ for the C=C stretch. But the question says 1720, which doesn't fit. So perhaps product 1 isn't an alkene.

Wait, unless the IR is for another functional group. Maybe the product is a ketone. So how can elimination form a ketone? Hmm, maybe through a retro-aldol reaction? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's not elimination. Maybe the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, but that would produce a diol, which doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, it forms a metal intermediate which then forms some kind of carbonyl group via a rearrangement. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, which would have an oxygen adjacent to a double bond. The IR of an enol ether's C-O-C might be around 1250, but again, the IR here is 1720.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Product 2 is treated with ozone and then dimethyl sulfide to form product 3. Ozonolysis of a double bond generally breaks it into two carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond, and product 3 would be the ozonolysis products.

If product 3 is formed from ozonolysis, then product 2 has at least one double bond. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

So product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2, which has a double bond. How does that happen?

Wait, Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. It could catalyze the formation of a double bond via elimination. So perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination with Al isopropoxide as a catalyst. So product 1 would be the diol, and product 2 is the alkene.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me retrace:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH to form 1,3-adamantanediol (product 1). But wait, the IR of product 1 is 1720, which is a carbonyl, not a diol. Hmm.

Alternatively, product 1 is a diol, but then upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, it loses water to form an alkene (product 2). Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to product 3.

But then, product 1's IR wouldn't show a carbonyl because it's a diol. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a conjugated diene, and product 2 is a more substituted alkene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two adjacent bridgehead carbons.

When KOH is added, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to an E2 elimination, forming a double bond between the two bridgehead carbons. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantylene, an alkene. But then the IR peak would be around 1650, not 1720. So this doesn't fit.

But the IR shows 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: The elimination could produce a cyclopropane ring, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Let's say each Br is replaced with OH, forming a diol. Then, perhaps the diol is treated with Al isopropoxide to form an acetal or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol undergoes some kind of oxidation. But that would require an oxidizing agent, not Al isopropoxide.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for other clues in the NMR.

Product 1's NMR: 4.79 (2H, singlet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, multiplet), 1.94 (2H, perhaps a triplet or something). The singlet at 4.79 suggests no neighboring Hs. So maybe it's a CH2 group connected to something deshielded, like an oxygen or a carbonyl.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then adjacent to the carbonyl is a CH2 group, which would be split by any neighboring Hs. If it's a singlet, that implies no Hs next to it, which is possible if it's (CH2)2CO, but in a larger structure.

Wait, but in the NMR, 4.79 is 2H, so perhaps (CH2) next to carbonyl, and the rest being ring CH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, such as cyclohexanone, but adamantane-based.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester. So the structure would have OCO connected to a CH2 group.

But how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form an ester upon treatment with KOH? That doesn't seem obvious.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that would require geminal dihalide, which 1,3-dibromo isn't.

Wait, maybe the product is a conjugated dienone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement during elimination. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone substituent, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl group formed via some kind of dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the product 3 and its NMR. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

If product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 after ozonolysis would have carbonyl groups. So the most deshielded H would be on a carbonyl group. Wait, but in ozonolysis, the products are carbonyl compounds. So their H NMR would show signals from any alpha protons.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, especially when done at low temperatures like -78°C, the reaction tends to form ozonides that upon workup (like with dimethyl sulfide) break to form carbonyl groups without overoxidizing. So if product 2 is 1,3-adamantylene (an alkene), ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, producing a diketone or something similar.

So, product 3 would be a diketone. Now, the NMR of product 3 would show signals from the alpha protons (if any) to the carbonyl groups.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to the carbonyl group. So, if there are CH2 groups next to the carbonyl, their protons would be deshielded and appear downfield.

In the case of a diketone, each carbonyl would have adjacent CH2 groups. The alpha protons would typically be split based on their neighboring protons.

Wait, for example, if each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, and those CH2 groups are each next to another CH2, then the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, if the structure is symmetric, the splitting might be simpler.

But let's imagine that each carbonyl group has a CH2 group next to it. Each of those CH2 groups would have two protons. The coupling between adjacent CH2 groups would lead to a certain splitting pattern.

Wait, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, the protons would be split into a quartet (each H coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2). But if each CH2 is next to another CH2 which is also next to another CH2, the splitting could become more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is only coupled to one other CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets or something.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be the ones closest to the carbonyl. Let's say the structure is (CH2)nCO.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the product depends on the structure of the double bond. For example, if the alkene in product 2 is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would form two aldehyde groups. If it's between a CH2 and a CH group, it would form a ketone and an aldehyde.

But in the case of adamantylene, perhaps the structure is such that ozonolysis produces two ketone groups. So product 3 would be a diketone.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone, perhaps with each ketone connected to a CH2 group. Then, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would each have two Hs. Those Hs would be split by any adjacent Hs.

If each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet for each. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the CH2 groups are adjacent, each H would see two Hs from their own group and two Hs from the neighboring group. Wait, no, each H on a CH2 group would only couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So for each H on the first CH2, they would be next to two Hs on the second CH2. So each H would be split into a triplet (n+1, where n=2).

But if the two CH2 groups are equivalent, then the splitting might be a triplet for each, but perhaps they are not equivalent.

Wait, if the structure is symmetric, the splitting could be a doublet of doublets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, and each has two neighboring Hs. So each H would be a triplet. But if each CH2 is connected to another CH2, which is connected to another CH2, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, but perhaps the Hs are all equivalent, leading to a singlet. But that's unlikely unless it's a very symmetrical structure.

Alternatively, if the CH2 groups are each connected to a carbonyl, and the other side is connected to another CH2, which is connected to another CH2, then each H would have coupling with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 and possibly more.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about a specific example.

Suppose the structure is (CH2)2CO-R. If R is another CH2 group leading to another CO, such as (CH2)2CO-CH2-CH2-CO, but that's not likely because of the adamantane structure.

Alternatively, the structure after ozonolysis could have each carbonyl group connected to a CH2, which is then connected to a ring structure.

In any case, the most deshielded H would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl. These Hs would be split by neighboring Hs.

If each CH2 is between two carbonyls, then each H would have coupling with two Hs on the same CH2 (but they are equivalent, so that doesn't split). Wait, no, each H on the CH2 would only couple with Hs on adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps each CH2 group is next to only one other CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the second CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But if each H on the CH2 is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, then each H is a triplet. So the splitting pattern would be a triplet.

Wait, but the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, if the Hs are each coupled with two Hs from one group and another two from another group, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and one H from another. For example, if the structure is CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 would have coupling with the adjacent CH2. So the Hs on the first CH2 would be a triplet (coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2), and the Hs on the second CH2 would be a triplet as well.

But in product 3, the exact structure isn't clear, so I'm not certain.

Wait, considering the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If each H is coupled with two Hs from one group and another two from another, that could lead to a triplet of triplets (each H has two couplings, each splitting into triplets). Or perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and one H from another, that could lead to a doublet of triplets.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but considering that the most deshielded H would be adjacent to two Hs on one side and possibly none on the other (in a chain), perhaps it's a triplet.

Wait, but in the case of a CH2 group next to another CH2, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet. So the answer would be option A.

Alternatively, if the structure is more complex, with each CH2 next to two different CH2 groups, leading to more splitting.

But given the options, and considering that the most likely scenario is each H is coupled with two Hs from an adjacent CH2, the splitting would be a triplet. So the answer is A.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with excess KOH at 240°C.  
   - KOH is a strong base, and the reaction likely involves elimination (E2 mechanism), leading to the formation of an alkene.  
   - However, the IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests that the product is not a simple alkene but rather a carbonyl compound.  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. The other signals (2.41-2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm) correspond to hydrogens in a rigid adamantane framework.  
   - Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is identified as a ketone, likely 1,3-adamantanone.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 (1,3-adamantanone) is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid.  
   - Al(OiPr)₃ likely facilitates the formation of an enolate intermediate, which rearranges to form a conjugated alkene (product 2).  
   - The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is inferred to contain at least one double bond due to the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Ozonolysis and Workup**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide (a reductive workup).  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl-containing products (product 3).  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group, and its coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring hydrogens.

4. **Analysis of Coupling Pattern**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This CH₂ group is coupled with two hydrogens from an adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a splitting pattern of a triplet.  
   - The other options (triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet) are less consistent with the expected structure and splitting pattern.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.  

**Answer: A**
