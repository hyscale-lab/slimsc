Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, I remember that the potential energy between charges is what's important here. Since all the charges are identical, the system's potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, since the 13th charge is fixed at P, maybe I should consider the potential it creates for the other charges and vice versa.

Wait, no, each charge contributes to the potential. So the total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs. But since the 13th is fixed, perhaps I can think of it as the energy due to the 12 moving charges in the field of the fixed one, plus the energy among the 12 charges themselves.

But wait, no. Because all the 12 are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So the distance between each of the 12 charges and the 13th is 2 meters. But the distance between any two of the 12 charges is... wait, are they all at the same point, or spread out in a sphere of radius 2 meters? Oh, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each of the 12 is on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m. So the positions are all 2m away, but their arrangement on the surface isn't specified. For the minimum energy, perhaps they arrange themselves as far apart as possible, but wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy, so maybe that's the minimum potential energy configuration. But wait, wait. The 12 charges are identical and, being same sign, they repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, which is a measure of the work done to bring them together, maybe they'll arrange themselves as close as possible. But I'm not sure if that affects the calculation here. Because in the problem, each of the 12 is fixed at 2m from P, but their mutual distances aren't fixed. But perhaps, for the purpose of calculating potential energy, we can consider that each of the 12 charges only interacts with the fixed charge (13th) and with each other. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. Maybe the arrangement that minimizes the potential energy is the one where the mutual potential energies among the 12 are the least. But I'm confused.

Wait, but since the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, maybe their positions can vary on the sphere, but their distances from each other can vary. For the minimum potential energy, each pair of the 12 charges would have to be as close as possible. Because repelling charges have higher potential energy when farther apart. Wait, no, wait. For like charges, the potential energy is positive and increases with distance. So to minimize the total potential energy, you want to maximize the distances between them. No, wait, no. The potential energy between two like charges is U = k*(q1 q2)/r. Since q1 and q2 are positive, U is positive. So, higher r would mean lower U. So to minimize the total potential energy, you want each pair to be as far apart as possible. So arranging the 12 charges uniformly on the sphere would maximize the distances, thus minimizing the total U. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So the configuration that gives the least possible potential energy would be the one with the 12 charges arranged as far apart as possible, right? Because that would minimize the sum of their mutual potentials.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy for systems of multiple charges can be a bit tricky. The potential energy of the entire system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So each pair contributes (k * q_i q_j) / r_ij, but because all the 12 charges are identical, each pair contributes the same amount, assuming they are all at the same distance apart. But in reality, if they are all on a sphere of radius 2m, the mutual distances between any two would vary depending on the angle between them. For instance, if they are all equally spaced on the sphere, the distance between any two would be the same. Wait, but that's only possible for certain numbers of points. For 12 points, maybe it's possible to arrange them at the vertices of a cuboctahedron or something, but regardless, perhaps the problem expects us to treat each of the 12 charges as being at the same distance from each other as 2m? No, that can't be right. Because the distance from each of the 12 to the center is 2m, but their mutual distances are determined by the angle theta between them. For example, two points on a sphere of radius r separated by an angle theta have a distance of d = 2r sin(theta/2). So the mutual distance between any two of the 12 charges depends on their positions. So if I arrange them so that each pair is as far apart as possible, each pair would have the maximum possible distance. But wait, in reality, it's impossible for all pairs to be at maximum distance on a sphere. So perhaps the problem is making an assumption that each pair of the 12 charges is at 4 meters apart. But that doesn't make sense because if each is 2m from the center, the maximum possible distance between two charges on the sphere would be 4 meters if they're diametrically opposite. But for 12 charges, arranging all of them to be at maximum distance from each other isn't feasible. So perhaps the problem is simplifying things and considering that each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from each other, but I think that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem neglects the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges and only considers their potential with the fixed charge. But that seems unlikely because the mutual potentials would contribute to the total energy.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: it says "the 13th charge is fixed at P." The other 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is 2 m away from P, but their mutual distances vary, but perhaps the problem is only considering their potential with the fixed charge. No, that can't be, because the system's total potential energy includes all pairs.

So perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th, and then also compute the potential energy among the 12 charges themselves, assuming perhaps that each pair is at a certain distance. Wait, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute that. So maybe the problem is making an assumption that the mutual distances are all the same, perhaps 2 meters. But that doesn't make sense because two points on a sphere of radius 2 m can't be 2 m apart unless they are at 60 degrees apart or something. Wait, no, wait. The distance between two points on a sphere of radius r is d = 2r sin(theta/2
