--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance and its decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says X is a meson resonance with production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. We need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember something about particles decaying and the distance they travel before decaying. Oh right, the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But wait, how do we find the lifetime? Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ through the uncertainty principle. I think the formula is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Or wait, maybe it's Γ = ħ * τ^-1? Because Γ is the decay rate, which has units of energy (since ħ has units of energy*time).

So, from Γ, I can find τ. Once I have τ, I can find the mean decay distance, which is the velocity v multiplied by τ. Because the particle is moving, so the distance it travels before decaying is v times the lifetime.

But wait, the velocity depends on the energy. The particle's energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV. Its rest mass is 1.2 GeV, so I can compute its gamma factor. Gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, but E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², so the units should work out. Let me think: E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²) * c²? Wait no, E is already in units of GeV, which is energy. m is in GeV/c², so E = (gamma m c²) is correct. So gamma is E/(m c²) / (c²) no, wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, E = gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). But since E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c², so m c² is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

Now, the velocity v can be found using beta = v/c. Beta is approximately sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) for high gamma, but wait, let's think. The exact expression is beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)), right? Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). 

So, plugging gamma = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So 1/gamma² is approximately 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is about 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is roughly 0.9887, so beta is about 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887c, approximately 0.989c.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1/gamma squared = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v is 0.9887c.

Now, let's get back to the decay distance. The mean decay length L is v * tau.

We need to compute tau. From the relation Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. We'll need to convert units to make sure everything is consistent.

So, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ c is about 197.3 MeV·fm, but maybe we don't need that here.

Wait, let's make sure. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. But since ħ = h/(2π), that's about 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But when working in GeV units, it's often expressed in GeV·s. So 1 GeV is 1.602 × 10^-10 J. So ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. I think that's correct.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let's convert that to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV.

So, tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.320) s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = approximately 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So tau is about 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, the velocity v is about 0.9887c. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, L = v * tau = 0.9887c * tau.

So, let's calculate that:

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

tau is 2.057e-24 seconds.

So, L ≈ 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Multiply those numbers: 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e-16.

Calculating 2.966 * 2.057: Let's see, 2 * 2.057 is 4.114, 0.966 * 2.057 ≈ 2.000 (approx 2.000). So total is about 6.114. So L ≈ 6.114e-16 meters.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Hmm. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me re-calculate gamma.

E_X is 8 GeV. m_X is 1.2 GeV.

Gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. That's correct.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

Tau calculation: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s. Γ is 0.320 GeV.

Tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.320 = approx 2.056e-24 seconds. Correct.

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.9661e8 m/s.

Then L = v * tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = 2.9661 * 2.056 * 1e-16.

Wait, 2.9661 * 2.056 is let's compute accurately:

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322

2.9661 * 0.056 = approx 0.1673.

So total is about 5.9322 + 0.1673 ≈ 6.0995.

So L ≈ 6.10e-16 meters. Hmm, but the options are all around 4e-15 or 5e-15 or similar.

Wait, that's way off. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait another thought. Maybe I got the relation between Γ and tau wrong. Decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime tau as Γ = ħ * (1/tau). So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I was supposed to use the natural line width or something else. Hmm, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: the mean proper lifetime tau is related to the decay width Γ by Γ = ħ c tau^-1? Or am I mixing something up.

No, wait, the decay width Γ has units of energy. The uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty and Δt is the time uncertainty. For a particle at rest, the decay width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so Γ ≈ ħ / tau. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the velocity. Let's think again about beta.

Beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So E² = gamma² m² c^4.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(gamma² m² c^4 )) ) = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²), which is the same as before. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is with the production energy? Wait, the production energy is given as E_X =8 GeV. But for a meson, which is a bound state of a quark and antiquark, maybe the energy is not just the kinetic energy, but the total energy. So E is the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic. So our calculation is correct.

Wait, but the decay length I calculated is 6e-16 meters, but the options are around 4e-15 to 5e-15.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, let's recompute tau.

Gamma is 0.320 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

That part seems correct.

Wait, another thought: the mean decay length is not just v*tau, because the particle is moving, but perhaps it's (gamma) v tau. Wait, no, because gamma comes into play when considering time dilation. Wait, the lifetime tau is the proper time, the lifetime in the rest frame. So when the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is gamma * tau. So the mean decay length is v * (gamma tau).

Ah! Oh! So that's where I went wrong. Because tau is the proper lifetime. The mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the decay length L is v * gamma tau.

So I missed a factor of gamma. That explains why my previous calculation was off by a factor of about 6.6667.

So let's recalculate:

L = v * (gamma * tau).

v is 0.9887c.

Gamma is 6.6667.

So L = 0.9887c * gamma * tau.

So tau is 2.056e-24 s.

So let me compute again.

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

gamma = 6.6667.

So, gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056e-24 s = approx 1.37e-23 s.

Then L = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37e-23 s = 2.966 * 1.37 * 1e-15 m.

Calculating 2.966 * 1.37.

Hmm, 3 * 1.37 is 4.11. But 2.966 is a bit less than 3, so let's compute:

1.37 * 2.966 ≈ (1.37 * 3) - (1.37 * 0.034) = 4.11 - 0.04658 ≈ 4.0634.

So L ≈ 4.0634e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15. So option B is very close.

Wait, let's do a more precise calculation to get the exact value.

First, compute gamma exactly: E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. Gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666666667.

Compute beta exactly: beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

But since E² = gamma^2 m^2 c^4, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.988733898.

So beta is approximately 0.988733898.

So v = beta c = 0.988733898 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966201694e8 m/s.

Compute tau: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 0.320 GeV.

Tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.320 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * tau = 6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s.

v * (gamma tau) = 2.966201694e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply 2.966201694e8 by 1.37125e-23:

Compute 2.966201694 * 1.37125:

Let me calculate:

2.966201694 * 1.37125.

Let me do this step by step.

1.37125 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.00125.

But perhaps a better way is to compute 2.966201694 * 1.37125.

Calculate 2.966201694 * 1 = 2.966201694

2.966201694 * 0.3 = 0.8898605082

2.966201694 * 0.07 = 0.2076341186

2.966201694 * 0.00125 = 0.0037077521175

Adding these together:

2.966201694 + 0.8898605082 = 3.8560622022

+0.2076341186 = 4.0636963208

+0.0037077521175 ≈ 4.0674040729.

So 2.966201694 * 1.37125 ≈ 4.0674040729.

So the product is approximately 4.0674e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 4.0674e-15, but the closest option is B:4.0655e-15. But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation of beta and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere else.

Wait, let me re-calculate the product of v and gamma*tau.

v = beta c = (sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2))) * c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta using exact values.

Wait, let me compute beta more accurately.

Gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 = 6.6666667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775).

What is sqrt(0.9775)?

Let me compute it more precisely. sqrt(0.9775).

We can write 0.9775 = 0.9887^2? Let me check.

0.9887^2 ≈ (0.98)^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.0171 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97757569.

Wait, but 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.977575, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887.

But perhaps a more precise value is needed. Let me use a calculator approach.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me consider x=0.9775.

We can approximate sqrt(x) using the Taylor expansion around x=1:

sqrt(x) ≈ 1 - (1 - x)/2 + ( (1 - x)^2 )/8 - ... 

But maybe a better approach is to find a value around 0.9887.

Wait, let's compute 0.9887^2 = 0.97757569 (as above).

But we want x=0.9775, which is 0.97757569 - 0.00007569.

So, let me compute (0.9887 - delta)^2 = 0.9775.

(0.9887 - delta)^2 = 0.9887^2 - 2 * 0.9887 * delta + delta^2 = 0.97757569 - 1.9774 delta + delta^2.

Set this equal to 0.9775:

0.97757569 - 1.9774 delta + delta^2 = 0.9775.

So:

-1.9774 delta + delta^2 = 0.9775 - 0.97757569 = -0.00007569.

Assuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible. So:

-1.9774 delta ≈ -0.00007569 → delta ≈ 0.00007569 / 1.9774 ≈ 3.822e-5.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887 - 0.00003822 ≈ 0.9886618.

So beta is approximately 0.9886618.

So v = beta c = 0.9886618 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9659854e8 m/s.

Now, gamma is 6.6666667.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * tau = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s.

L = v * gamma tau = 2.9659854e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply 2.9659854e8 * 1.37125e-23.

Let me compute 2.9659854 * 1.37125.

Wait, 2.9659854 * 1.37125:

Let me compute 2 * 1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.9659854 * 1.37125.

Wait, let's compute 0.9659854 * 1.37125.

Break it down:

1.37125 * 0.9 = 1.234125

1.37125 * 0.06 = 0.082275

1.37125 * 0.0059854 ≈ approximately 0.00815.

Adding them together: 1.234125 + 0.082275 = 1.3164, plus 0.00815 ≈ 1.32455.

So total is 2.7425 + 1.32455 ≈ 4.06705.

So L ≈ 4.06705e-15 meters.

Hmm, the options are:

B: 4.0655e-15 m

C:5.0223e-15 m

Wait, our calculation is about 4.067e-15, which is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15, but a little higher. Maybe due to more precise beta value.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would give 4.0655e-15.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact product.

Let me compute 2.9659854e8 * 1.37125e-23.

Wait, another approach: compute 2.9659854 * 1.37125 = ?

Let me compute 2.9659854 * 1.37125.

Let me calculate:

2.9659854 * 1.37125 = ?

Let me compute this step by step.

Compute 2.9659854 * 1 = 2.9659854.

2.9659854 * 0.3 = 0.88979562.

2.9659854 * 0.07 = 0.207618978.

2.9659854 * 0.00125 = 0.00370748175.

Adding all together:

2.9659854

+ 0.88979562 = 3.85578102

+ 0.207618978 = 4.06340000

+ 0.00370748175 ≈ 4.06710748.

So, product is approximately 4.06710748.

So L = 4.06710748e-15 meters.

But the option B is 4.0655e-15, which is slightly less. Hmm, so perhaps in the calculation, the exact value would be a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me compute beta more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the decay width and lifetime without involving beta and gamma, but maybe using relativistic equations correctly.

Another approach: the mean decay length L is given by L = (c * tau * gamma * beta).

But all right, perhaps I should just proceed with the initial approach and see which option is closest.

In our calculation, we have approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15) and a bit higher.

But considering that I approximated beta, perhaps the exact value would come out to option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the product. Let me compute 2.9659854e8 * 1.37125e-23 precisely.

Breaking it down:

2.9659854e8 = 2.9659854 ×1e8 m/s.

1.37125e-23 s = 1.37125 ×1e-23 s.

Multiply them:

(2.9659854 × 1.37125) × (1e8 × 1e-23) = (4.06710748) × 1e-15 m.

So L ≈4.0671e-15 m.

Which is closer to option B (4.0655e-15) or C (5.0223e-15).

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the initial calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the production energy is not the same as the energy of the meson. Wait, the problem states that the production energy is E_X=8 GeV. So perhaps that's the energy of the meson, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of gamma.

Gamma is E/(m) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let me recompute ħ.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV s.

Wait, some sources give ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV fm. But perhaps that's not directly needed here.

But perhaps I should recheck the calculation of tau.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes.

So, I think the calculation is correct, and the closest option is B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would yield 4.0655e-15.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to use the mean proper lifetime, but I thought that the decay length is v multiplied by the dilated lifetime (gamma * tau).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mean lifetime correctly.

Wait, no, the decay length is definitely v multiplied by the lifetime as seen in the lab frame, which is gamma times tau.

So, the calculation seems correct. Thus, the answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship between the mean decay length \( L \), the velocity \( v \), and the lifetime \( \tau \): 

\[
L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The energy of the meson is given as \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \beta \) by \( v = \beta c \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean lifetime \( \tau \)
The decay width \( \Gamma \) is related to the mean lifetime \( \tau \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.320 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.320} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is given by:

\[
L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.6667) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \cdot \tau \):

\[
\gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

Now, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
