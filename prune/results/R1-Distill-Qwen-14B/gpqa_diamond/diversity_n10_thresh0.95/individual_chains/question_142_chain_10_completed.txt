Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are various points in three-dimensional space, but wait—is qubit space three-dimensional? Hmm.

Wait, I remember that a qubit is a two-level system, so its state space is two-dimensional. But when dealing with density matrices, especially for qubits, how does that translate geometrically? I think the Bloch sphere is involved here. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent the state of a qubit. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The density matrix ρ given here is the completely mixed state for a qubit. Because |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are the projectors for the basis states, and averaging them with equal weights (since 1/2 is the coefficient) would give a maximally mixed state. So this should correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere.

On the Bloch sphere, the pure states are represented as points on the surface, with the state |0⟩ at (1,0,0) and |1⟩ at (-1,0,0) or something like that. But the mixed state, which is maximally mixed, would be the center, which is the origin. So the coordinates would be (0,0,0).

Wait, but in the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be written in terms of a vector r with components (x,y,z) such that the density matrix is (I + r · σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Let me think about that formula.

So, for a general state, ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2. The vector r would be (r_x, r_y, r_z). For the given ρ, let's see what it looks like.

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute this. |0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by 1/2, we get [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]], which is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2.

Now, according to the formula, ρ = (I + r · σ)/2. So (I + r · σ)/2 equals (I)/2. That implies that r · σ must be zero. Because I/2 + (r·σ)/2 = I/2 → r·σ=0.

So each component of r must satisfy r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

If the sum r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z is the zero matrix, each element must be zero. Let's write that out.

The (1,1) element is r_z * 1 + 0 + 0 = r_z. For this to be zero, r_z must be zero.

The (1,2) element is r_x * 1 + r_y * (-i). So that's r_x - i r_y. For this to be zero, both real and imaginary parts must be zero. So r_x must be zero, and r_y must be zero as well.

So r is the zero vector (0,0,0). That makes sense because the state is completely mixed, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which must be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, while mixed states are inside. The maximally mixed state corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin with coordinates \((0,0,0)\).

To confirm this, recall that the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is related to the density matrix by:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), it simplifies to:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

which implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). This means \( r_x = 0 \), \( r_y = 0 \), and \( r_z = 0 \), so \( \mathbf{r} = (0,0,0) \).

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin.
