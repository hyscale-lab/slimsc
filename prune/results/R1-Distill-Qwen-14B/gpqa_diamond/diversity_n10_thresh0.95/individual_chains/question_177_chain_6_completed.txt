Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to find out how much more luminous Star_1 is compared to Star_2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, but I'm not sure if mass plays a role here since the question is about luminosity. Maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps it factors into something else like temperature?

The stars' spectra show the same peak wavelength. Oh, right! That must relate to their temperatures. Because I remember from blackbody radiation that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but why would their temperatures be the same? Maybe because they are similar types of stars, but I don't think that's necessary for this calculation. Anyway, moving on.

The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right! The Doppler shift formula. If a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, and if moving away, longer. But wait, the problem states that the peak wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed maximum wavelength is the same. But their actual (rest) wavelengths might differ because of their velocities.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Oh, no, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the measured lambda_max for both stars is the same. But the actual lambda_max (in rest frame) depends on their velocities. Because when a star is moving, the observed wavelength shifts. So how does this affect their actual temperatures?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me get back. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4. So if I can find the temperatures and radii, I can compute the luminosity ratio.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 (wait, is that true?), but I'm getting confused because the observed lambda_max is the same. But the actual lambda_max depends on temperature, but because they are moving, the observed lambda_max is different from their rest frame. Or wait, no, the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So perhaps their rest frame lambda_max are different, but after considering the Doppler shift, they appear the same. Hmm.

Wait, I think I need to calculate the actual temperatures, considering the Doppler effect. So for each star, the observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity in terms of the speed of light, but wait, it's probably better to use the approximation for small velocities. Alternatively, maybe use the relativistic Doppler shift formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula when the velocity is much less than the speed of light (which it is, 700 km/s is about 0.0023c, so small) can be approximated as lambda_observed ≈ lambda_rest (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive if moving away. So for Star_1, v_r is 0, so lambda1_observed = lambda1_rest. For Star_2, v_r is positive 700 km/s, so lambda2_observed ≈ lambda2_rest (1 + 700e3 / 3e5e3 ). Let me calculate that fraction: 700e3 / 3e8 ≈ 2.33e-3, so about 0.233%. So 1 + 0.00233 is approximately 1.00233. So lambda2_observed ≈ lambda2_rest * 1.00233.

But according to the problem, the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars. So lambda1_observed = lambda2_observed.

But lambda1_observed is lambda1_rest (since v_r=0), and lambda2_observed is lambda2_rest * 1.00233.

So lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * 1.00233. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1 + z) where z is the redshift. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relation between observed and rest wavelengths.

Alternatively, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when moving away. But since v is 700 km/s, which is much less than c, we can approximate it as (1 + v/c) for small v.

Wait, no, the correct approximation for small v is lambda_obs ≈ lambda_rest (1 + v/c), for a source moving away. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer. So lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is 700 km/s.

Star_1 has v1 = 0, so lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest.

We are told that lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs. So, lambda1_rest = lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest (1 + v2/c).

But lambda_max (rest) is related to temperature via Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T.

So, from above, lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest (1 + v2/c).

But lambda1_rest = b / T1, lambda2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting:

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c)

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c)

Which rearranges to:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Wait, because 1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) (1/T2)

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Hmm, but wait, v2 is positive (700 km/s away from us), so (1 + v2/c) is a little more than 1, so T1 is a little less than T2. But wait, that can't be right because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, which would imply a lower temperature. But the observed lambdas are same, so their actual temperatures must adjust accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let's think again. The observed lambda_max is the same. So for Star_1, lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest (since it's not moving). For Star_2, lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c). And these are equal.

So lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest (1 + v2/c).

But lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So,

lambda1_rest = b/T1

lambda2_rest = b/T2

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) (1/T2)

Rearranged:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So, T1 is less than T2.

Wait, that would make T1 lower. But the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater. How does that happen?

Well, luminosity depends on R^2 T^4. So even if T1 is a bit smaller, R1 is 1.5 times larger, which would make (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times. But if T1 is less than T2, perhaps the product R^2 T^4 might end up being a bit less than 2.25 times. But I need to compute the exact ratio.

Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake in the Doppler shift. Let me think again. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer. So lambda_observed for Star_2 is longer than its rest frame. But since lambda_observed for both stars is the same, that would mean that Star_2's rest frame lambda is shorter than Star_1's. Because when you have a longer observed wavelength due to moving away, the rest frame must be shorter. So Star_2's rest lambda is shorter than Star_1's.

But lambda is inversely proportional to T. So shorter lambda_rest implies higher temperature. So T2 is higher than T1. Because lambda_rest is shorter for Star_2: lambda2_rest = lambda_observed / (1 + v2/c). So if Star_2 is moving away, its rest lambda is shorter than the observed.

Wait, maybe I should put this differently. Let me approach this with the Doppler formula more carefully.

The Doppler shift formula is often written as:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But for small v, this can be approximated as lambda_obs ≈ lambda_rest * (1 + v/c) for receding (v positive). But wait, actually, when the source is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer, so the (1 + v/c) is a factor greater than 1. But in this case, Star_2 is moving away, so lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

But according to the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

Since Star_1 is not moving, lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest. So,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

So,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5e3 )

Wait, 700e3 m/s is 700,000 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 700e3 / 3e8 = 700000 / 300000000 = 0.0023333...

So 1 + 0.0023333 is approximately 1.0023333.

So,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * 1.002333.

But lambda is inversely proportional to temperature: lambda_rest = b / T.

So,

lambda1_rest = (b / T1) = lambda2_rest * 1.002333 = (b / T2) * 1.002333

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1 / T2) * 1.002333

Rearranged:

T1 = T2 / 1.002333

Which is approximately T2 * (1 - 0.002327), since 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So,

T1 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002327) = T2 * 0.997673.

So T1 is about 0.997673 times T2.

Okay, now that I have the relation between T1 and T2, let's compute the luminosity ratio.

Luminosity is given by L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4. So,

L1 / L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4 )

We have T1 = T2 * 0.997673, so T1/T2 = 0.997673.

So,

(0.997673)^4 ≈ let's compute this.

0.997673^4:

First compute 0.997673 squared:

0.997673 * 0.997673 ≈ (1 - 0.002327)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002327 + (0.002327)^2 ≈ approx 0.995345.

Wait, but exact computation:

0.997673 * 0.997673.

Let me compute it step by step.

Multiply 0.997673 * 0.997673:

= (1 - 0.002327) * (1 - 0.002327)

= 1 - 2*0.002327 + (0.002327)^2

= 1 - 0.004654 + 0.000005415 (approx)

So, 1 - 0.004654 is 0.995346, plus 0.000005415 is about 0.9953514.

So, squared is approximately 0.9953514.

Then, to compute the fourth power, square that result again:

(0.9953514)^2 ≈ ?

Again, (1 - 0.0046486)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0046486 + (0.0046486)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009297 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.9907246.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately:

0.9953514 * 0.9953514:

= (0.995 + 0.0003514)^2

≈ 0.995^2 + 2*0.995 * 0.0003514 + (0.0003514)^2

0.995^2 = (1 - 0.005)^2 = 1 - 0.01 + 0.000025 = 0.990025.

2 * 0.995 * 0.0003514 = 2 * 0.0003509 = 0.0007018.

(0.0003514)^2 ≈ 1.234e-7 ≈ 0.0000001234.

So adding up:

0.990025 + 0.0007018 = 0.9907268.

Plus 0.0000001234 is approximately 0.9907269.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ (0.997673)^4 ≈ 0.9907269.

So, back to the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.9907269

1.5^2 is 2.25.

Multiply 2.25 * 0.9907269 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990727.

Hmm, what is 2.25 * 0.990727?

Well, 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275.

But 0.990727 is 0.99 + 0.000727.

So 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.000727 ≈ 0.00163025.

Adding together gives 2.2275 + 0.00163025 ≈ 2.22913.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is very close to this value.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another approach: Maybe the Doppler shift wasn't handled correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed temperature, which in turn affects the luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rest frame temperatures based on the observed peak wavelengths. Let me approach it from another angle.

The observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. Let’s denote lambda_obs as the same for both.

Each star has its own rest frame wavelength, lambda1_rest and lambda2_rest.

For Star_1, since it's not moving, lambda_obs = lambda1_rest.

For Star_2, which is moving away with velocity v2, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

So,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

From Wien's law, lambda_rest = b / T. So,

lambda1_rest = b / T1,

lambda2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) * (1/T2)

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + 0.002333)

= T2 / 1.002333

= T2 * (1 - 0.002327) [using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x]

So,

T1 ≈ 0.997673 * T2.

Now, compute L1/L2.

L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So,

(L1 / L2) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.997673)^4 ≈ 0.990726.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990726 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23. So the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity: 

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radii**: \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \)
2. **Observed Peak Wavelengths**: Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)).
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), and Star_2 has \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).
4. **Wien's Law**: \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \) is the rest-frame wavelength and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Step 1: Relating Rest-Frame Wavelengths
The observed wavelength for Star_2 is affected by its radial velocity due to the Doppler effect. For small velocities (\( v \ll c \)), the observed wavelength is approximated as:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest}} \left( 1 + \frac{v}{c} \right)
\]

For Star_1 (\( v_1 = 0 \)), \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{1,\text{rest}} \). For Star_2 (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is the same for both stars:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{rest}} = \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right)
\]

### Step 2: Relating Temperatures
From Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \). Substituting for \( \lambda_{1,\text{rest}} \) and \( \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} \):

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right)
\]

Canceling \( b \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right)
\]

Rearranging:

\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}
\]

Substituting \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \):

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.00233
\]

\[
T_1 = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + 0.00233} \approx T_2 \cdot (1 - 0.00233) \approx 0.99767 \, T_2
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
\]

Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \) and \( T_1 = 0.99767 \, T_2 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

1. \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \)
2. \( (0.99767)^4 \approx 0.990726 \)

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.990726 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times greater than that of Star_2.
