Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Hmm.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, right, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I think that means they form an orthonormal basis for the spin state. But wait, since the problem says |alpha> is proportional to that, I should probably normalize it first, right?

So first step: find the normalization constant. Let me write the state as |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ], where c is the normalization constant. To find c, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself and set it equal to 1.

The inner product would be |c|^2 [ (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) ] because the other terms would involve |up> and |down> being orthogonal. Let me compute each part.

(1+i)(1-i) is 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Wait, no, wait: (1+i)(1-i) = 1*1 + 1*(-i) + i*1 + i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². i squared is -1, so it's 1 - i +i +1 = 2. Right.

Then (2-i)(2+i) is 2² - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5. So adding those together, 2 +5=7. So |alpha> = c [ ... ] and |c|^2 *7 =1. So |c|^2 = 1/7, which means c = 1/sqrt(7). But wait, could be positive or negative, but since it's a normalization, we take the positive root. So c=1/sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the problem is about another operator whose matrix representation A_ij is given. The elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Wait, so A looks like:
[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Hmm, that's the matrix. Wait, what operator is this? Because if the operator has this form, it's probably related to the spin in the x or y direction. Let me think. The Pauli matrices, for example. Oh, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Wait, but the operator here has A_ij = hbar/2 for i !=j.

Wait, the spin operator in the x-direction (S_x) is (ħ/2) σ_x, right? Because the Pauli matrices are scaled by ħ/2. So σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so S_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's exactly matching the A matrix given here, except when looking at the problem statement, their A_ij is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Wait, no, if i and j are different, it's ħ/2. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], which is exactly (ħ/2) σ_x. Oh wait, but σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, this operator A is S_x, the spin-x operator.

So the operator is S_x, which has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of A. So perhaps the operator A is diagonal in the |+x> and |-x> basis. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are the eigenstates of S_x.

So the steps I think are:

1. Express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A (which is the |+x> and |-x> states).

2. The coefficients in this basis will give the probabilities for each eigenstate when measured.

3. The average value (expectation value) of the operator A is calculated using the state |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is S_x, I can compute the expectation value directly.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the eigenbasis of A. Let's find the eigenstates of A.

The eigenvalues of A can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0. For a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and A12=A21= ħ/2, the equation is:

| (-λ)    ħ/2      |
| ħ/2     (-λ)    |  = 0

Which gives λ² - ( (ħ/2)^2 ) =0 → λ= ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are the same as the spin in the x-direction.

The eigenstates can be found. Let's find for λ= ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I ) |v> =0 → rows:

- (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2:

(A + (ħ/2) I ) |v> =0 → (ħ/2 v1) + (ħ/2 v2 )=0 → v1 + v2=0 → v2= -v1.

So the eigenvectors are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but wait, wait, let me check.

Wait, in the standard basis, |up> is (1,0), |down> is (0,1). So the eigenvectors are (1,1) and (1,-1), but normalized. So |+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down> ), and |-x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down> ).

Wait, but wait, the matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

So to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can compute the inner products.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write |alpha> in the |up>, |down> basis, then express in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

But let me perhaps compute the coefficients of |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

Wait, |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

Expressed as a vector in the |up>, |down> basis, it's:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] for |up>
[ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] for |down>.

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the components of |alpha> in the |+x>, |-x> basis, I can compute the inner products.

Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) → coefficients [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

Similarly, |-x> is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2-i) ].

Wait, because:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1) * (1+i) + (1) * (2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, because |alpha> has (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down>, and when taking the inner product with |+x>, which is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), so it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, let me compute that:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 + i + 2 - i = 3. So the inner product is (3)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, the inner product with |-x> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Compute numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So inner product is (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)).

So the amplitude for |+x> is 3/sqrt(14), and for |-x> is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

But wait, the probabilities are the squares of the magnitudes.

So |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

| (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14) |^2 is sqrt( ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) )^2 / 14 → (1 +4) =5 → 25/14 ≈ 1.7857. Wait wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, wait the state |alpha> is normalized, so the sum of probabilities must be 1. So if I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, the inner product for |+x> is (3)/(sqrt(14)).

So its square is 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

The inner product for |-x> is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14). Its magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, that adds up to 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. So that's correct. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is close. But let me check the other options.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first part is about the probability of each eigenstate. The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. But wait, the average value is the expectation value of operator A, which is the same as S_x.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value directly.

The expectation value <A> is the inner product <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is S_x, perhaps there's another way.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using the matrix.

The state |alpha> is a column vector in the |up>, |down> basis as:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]

The operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

So let me compute it.

Let me denote the components of |alpha> as:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So the conjugate transpose is [ a*, b* ].

So the product a* A a + b* A b + cross terms?

Wait, no, matrix multiplication is:

<alpha| A |alpha> = a* (A a) + b* (A b).

Wait, A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So A a is [ (hbar/2)*b, (hbar/2)*a ]^T.

So A a = [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

Similarly, A b is [ (hbar/2) a*, (hbar/2) b* ]^T?

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me compute each element.

Compute A multiplied by the vector |alpha>:

|alpha> is [a, b]^T.

A |alpha> = [0*a + (hbar/2)*b, (hbar/2)*a +0*b ]^T = [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

Then, the inner product is [a*, b*] times [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

Which is a* (hbar/2) b + b* (hbar/2) a.

Factor out hbar/2: (hbar/2) ( a* b + b* a ).

But a* b is the conjugate of b* a, so a* b + b* a = 2 Re( a* b ).

So let's compute a* b.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* = (1-i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = (1-i)(2 -i) /7.

Multiply numerator: 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i².

i squared is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = (1) -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

So Re( a* b ) is 1/7.

So the expectation value is (hbar/2) * 2 * (1/7) = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36.

So the first two numbers in the option would be 0.64 and 0.36, with the average being hbar/7.

Looking at option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the probabilities of the eigenstates are the squares of the amplitudes in the |+x> and |-x> directions.

From earlier, the amplitudes were 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14).

So the squares are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571. So the closest option is A) 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

But let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → this matches.

Other options: option B: 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt(7) → no. Option C: 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt(7) → no. Option D: 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7) → no.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the expectation value. Because when I computed the expectation value, I got hbar/7. But option A's average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be calculated. The state of the electron is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the inner product:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) corresponds to the spin-\( x \) operator \( S_x \), with eigenstates \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), and eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) basis
The coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) basis are computed as:
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the components of \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value is computed as:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
From the calculations:
- Probabilities: \( P(+x) \approx 0.64 \), \( P(-x) \approx 0.36 \),
- Average value: \( \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

These match **Option A**: \( 0.64, 0.36, \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

ANSWER: A
