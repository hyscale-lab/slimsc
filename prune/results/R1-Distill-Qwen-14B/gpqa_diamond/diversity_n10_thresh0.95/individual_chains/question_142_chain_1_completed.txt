Okay, so I have this question about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. Since the coefficients here are (1/2) for each term, I think this might be a mixed state. Wait, because in a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But here, each term is a projector and they're added, so that makes sense for a mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh wait, I think in the Bloch sphere representation, which is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix ρ is |ψ><ψ|, and in Bloch sphere terms, it's represented by a point on the surface of the sphere. The vector r is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are X, Y, Z, right?

The expectation value for X is r_x, Y is r_y, Z is r_z. So for a general state, the Bloch vector r is (r_x, r_y, r_z). For a pure state, the density matrix is (I + r · σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find the components of r.

Wait, let me write down the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term:

|0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. So when you add them, you get [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then you multiply by 1/2, so ρ becomes [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. 

Wait, that's just the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. So ρ is (I)/2, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Now, the general form of the density matrix for the Bloch sphere is (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2. So when we compare this to our ρ, which is I/2, that implies that the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero. Because the other terms (from the Pauli matrices) are zero. So the vector r is (0, 0, 0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the geometrical position is the origin. Wait, but the origin in the Bloch sphere is the completely mixed state, right? Because when r is zero, the state is (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. That makes sense because the given ρ is a completely mixed state, having equal probability for both |0> and |1>, so no coherence and no preference in any direction.

So the correct option is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is not a projector (which would describe a pure state). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we interpret it using the Bloch sphere representation. In this framework, a general density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector that determines the state's position in the Bloch sphere.

For the given \(\rho\), expanding the terms \(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right|\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right|\) yields:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that all coefficients of the Pauli matrices in the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state, which has no preference for any direction and equal probability for both states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\).

From the options provided:

- **A)** \(r = (1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state with specific coherences.
- **B)** \(r = (0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.
- **C)** \(r = (0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state.
- **D)** \(r = (1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state with specific coherences.

Thus, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is the origin.

Answer: C
