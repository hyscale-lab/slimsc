Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think through each part carefully.

So, the question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C gives product 1, a light yellow solid. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. The reaction is similar to dehydrohalogenation, which gives alkenes via an E2 mechanism. So, in this case, the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons of adamantane. Heating with KOH would likely lead to the formation of an alkene. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, or something similar. 

Looking at the NMR spectrum of product 1: The peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Wait, IR absorption at about 1720 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But wait, if the product from KOH is an elimination product, which should be an alkene, why the IR shows a carbonyl? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else. 

Wait another thought: Oh! Maybe I'm confusing the reactions. Another possibility is that the dibromide undergoes a substitution instead. But KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination, but that might not form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is not elimination but something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Maybe it's not elimination but a substitution. If KOH is in excess and heat is applied, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, but wait, that would be a diene. But then, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the product.

Wait another angle: Maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How? Oh, wait, perhaps when two bromides are adjacent, under certain conditions, they can undergo a coupling reaction. Or maybe a ring-opening? No, adamantane is a very stable structure, so it's unlikely to open.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reaction conditions. Some sources say that when 1,2-dihalides react with strong bases like KOH, they eliminate to form alkenes. But perhaps in this case, the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but with KOH, it's more elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. No, because KOH is a strong base; substitution would require a polar aprotic solvent and maybe a different setup. Hmm, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the compound isn't 1,3-dibromoadamantane but 1,2-dibromo, but the question says 1,3.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone. How? Maybe the KOH is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but that's elimination. Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a carbonyl group. Wait, no, because elimination typically forms double bonds, not carbonyls. Unless the elimination is forming an allene or some conjugated system, but I'm not sure.

Hold on, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the NMR of product 1. The peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be from an -OCH2- group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an epoxide. But wait, the IR has a peak around 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen? 

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be a di-elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Let me think: For every two X groups, perhaps eliminating H and X, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diols, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination. Let me imagine the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. 1,3-dibromo would have Brs on adjacent carbons in the diamondoid structure. So when KOH is added, perhaps each Br leaves, but that would require either a double elimination (unlikely) or perhaps a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would require a strong nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. If each bromide is replaced with an oxygen, but that would require oxidation, which I don't think KOH provides. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that would require an oxygen between two carbons. But then the IR would show an epoxide peak around 1200 cm-1, not 1720. So maybe that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps the initial reaction is elimination to form a double bond, and the IR is something else. Wait, but why the IR shows 1720? That's a strong peak, possibly a carbonyl. Perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else, like a substitution followed by oxidation. But I don't see how KOH would oxidize it. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the IR again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So the product must have a carbonyl group. So, the initial reaction must form a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but then the product would be a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the diol undergoes some oxidation. But with KOH, I don't think that's the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromide undergoes a coupling reaction. Wait, maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that usually requires Na, and two aryl halides. Adamantane is an aliphatic compound, so perhaps that's not applicable.

Wait another approach: The NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet, maybe an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 is a CH2 next to an electronegative atom, like O. For example, if it's an ether, the CH2 could be next to O. But the IR still shows a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. Suppose the elimination leads to the formation of a ring with a carbonyl. But I'm not exactly sure how that would happen.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone, but that would require two carbonyl groups, which might not fit the IR data unless it's a strong peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mono-ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative. Let me think: maybe the reaction forms a double bond in the adamantane structure, but also a carbonyl elsewhere. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via elimination. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but that's not how alkenes form. Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is an elimination
