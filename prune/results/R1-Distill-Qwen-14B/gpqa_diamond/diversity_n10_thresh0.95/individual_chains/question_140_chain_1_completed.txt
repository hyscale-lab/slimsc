--- Full Content ---
Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll go through it step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and another product B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. And we need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me break this down.

First, looking at the reaction: X reacts violently with Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, if the number of protons equals the number of neutrons, that means the isotope is a neutron-proton pair. For example, deuterium has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so that makes a molecule of H2, but wait, H2 as a molecule would have 2 H atoms. Each H atom has 1 proton, so the molecule has 2 protons. For the molecule to have equal protons and neutrons, each atom must have 1 proton and 1 neutron. So each H would be deuterium (D). So the gas W is probably D2 gas, but wait, D2 is just H2 with deuterium. Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, another possibility: If W is CO2, but that's not the case. Let me think again. The molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for the molecule, the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons.

Wait, perhaps it's a molecule like CH4? No, because the sum of protons (6 from C and 4 from H) would be 10, and neutrons would depend on the isotopes. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, if W is H2, then each H atom has 1 proton. So the total protons in H2 is 2. If each H is deuterium, then each has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So protons equal neutrons in the molecule. That fits. So W is H2 (but made of D, so it's D2 gas). So gas W is probably deuterium gas.

So, when X reacts with Y, it produces D2 gas. Now, what reactions produce D2? Well, if X contains deuterium, perhaps it's reacting with something to release D2. Wait, but X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe in X, one of the elements is a heavier isotope, like deuterium.

Hmm. Or perhaps, X is a metal that reacts with an acid to produce hydrogen gas. For example, if Y is an acid, and X is a metal. But if the gas is D2, then Y would be a deuterated acid, like D2SO4 (sulfuric acid with deuterium). Then, when a metal reacts with D2SO4, it would produce D2 gas. So X might be a metal, such as Mg, Zn, etc.

But wait, the problem says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So maybe X is something like D2O, but no, because when it reacts, it's producing gas, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What's a substance that melts near there? Mercury is about 234 K (which is -39 C), so that's too low. Maybe something else. Wait, 277 K is 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, melting point of water is 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. Wait, maybe it's some other substance. Alternatively, perhaps B is water, but that doesn't fit the context.

Wait, B is a product when G is heated. So G is some precipitate that upon heating releases B. So if G is a carbonate, heating it might release CO2. But that would make B CO2, which is a gas. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal reacting with D2O (but Y is a liquid, perhaps D2O). Wait, but then the reaction would produce H2 (but D2, actually), but if Y is D2O, then the reaction would be something like Mg + D2O → MgO + D2↑. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe Y is water (H2O), and X is a heavier isotope, like deuterium oxide (D2O). Then, if X and Y are mixed... Wait, but X is known for a heavier isotope, so perhaps X is D2O, and Y is H2O? But no, the gas produced would be H2, not D2. Hmm. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide, like H2O2. When it reacts with Y, maybe another substance. But I'm not sure. Let's think about the other part.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, the product has O2. Wait, the product would have 2 O atoms. So, the product could be something like an ester or another compound.

Wait, maybe the reaction is like a dehydration of a keto acid. For example, a keto acid (like a beta-keto acid) reacting with X to form an ester or something. If X is an acid catalyst, perhaps sulfuric acid, which is H2SO4. But then, the product of the reaction would have more O's. But the product has 2 O atoms. Hmm. Wait, maybe X is an alcohol, and the reaction is esterification. No, but X is incorporating a heavier isotope.

Wait, another angle: The substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents are things like DMSO (used in Swern oxidation), or maybe something like THF, but they don't fit the other parts. Or maybe X is something like D2O (deuterated water), which is used in NMR to exchange protons, but I'm not sure how that fits.

Wait, going back to the reaction. X reacts with Y, which is liquid, to produce gas W (D2), precipitate G, and B is a product when G is heated. B has a melting point of about 277 K (~4°C). What's a solid that melts around there?

Hmm, maybe B is something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K, so 277 K is a bit higher. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is ammonium chloride? No, that's a solid that decomposes at higher temps. Wait, maybe B is some oxide or hydroxide.

Wait, another idea: Let's think about the overall reaction. Maybe it's a double displacement reaction. For example, suppose X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid (Y) to produce CO2 gas (but wait, earlier we thought W is D2, but CO2 has 24 neutrons and 24 protons? Wait, no. CO2 has 12 protons (from C) + 16 (from O2) = 28 protons. Neutrons would be (14 from C) + (16 from O2) * 8 each? Wait, not sure. Maybe that's not the way.

Wait, maybe W is CO2. Let's think: CO2 has 1 C (6 protons) and 2 O (each 8 protons). So total protons is 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (since 12C is most common), and each O has 8 neutrons. So total neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. So yes, protons and neutrons equal. So W is CO2. Wait, that's a possibility.

So if W is CO2, then the reaction would produce CO2 gas. So, the reaction between X and Y would be something like a carbonate reacting with an acid to produce CO2.

Wait, but earlier thought about W being D2 would suggest that the reaction is producing hydrogen (deuterium) gas. So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps W is CH4? No, protons would be 6 (C) + 4 (H) =10. Neutrons would be (6 from C) + 4*(0 from H) =6. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, W is a molecule with equal number of protons and neutrons. So for CO2, protons sum to 22, and neutrons sum to 22. That fits. So W is CO2.

So in that case, Y could be an acid, and X could be a carbonate. So when a carbonate reacts with an acid, CO2 is released along with a precipitate (maybe a metal hydroxide if the acid is strong and the base is weak, but that might form a precipitate).

Wait, but the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So if G is a carbonate, heating it might decompose into CO2 and something else. But that would produce CO2 again, which is W. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, heating might produce a metal oxide and water. For example, heating Mg(OH)2 would produce MgO and H2O. But then B would be H2O or MgO. But the melting point of B is about 277 K, which is near 4°C. Hmm, water freezes at 273 K, so melting at 277 K would be a bit higher. Wait, maybe B is water. But when G is heated, does it release water? Or perhaps B is something else.

Wait, let's think of another possibility for W. If W is something like H2O, but that would have 2 H (each 1 proton) and O (8 protons), so total 10 protons. Neutrons would be 0 (H) + 8 (O) = 8. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another molecule: NH3. Protons: 14 (N) + 3 (H) =17. Neutrons: N has 7 (if 14N?), H has 0. So 7 +0=7. Not equal. Doesn't fit.

How about O2? Each O has 8 protons, so O2 has 16. Neutrons: each O is 8, so 16. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits. So W could be O2 gas.

But O2 is diatomic, so each O has 8 protons, so total 16. Each O has 8 neutrons in the most common isotope (O-16). So 16 neutrons. So yes, O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So W could be O2.

But then what reaction would produce O2 gas? Maybe a decomposition reaction, like a peroxide decomposing. But then, what's the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide and Y is an acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is X (a metal peroxide) reacting with Y (an acid) to produce O2 gas, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe X is a chlorate, and Y is something else, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think about the other part: the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, a keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has a keto group and a carboxylic acid group). Reacting with X to form a product with 2 O atoms. Maybe it's an esterification? Or perhaps a dehydration reaction.

Wait, if X is an acid catalyst, like H2SO4. Then, the keto acid would lose water (dehydration) to form an ester or another compound. But the product has 2 O atoms. Maybe it's forming a ketone. For example, if the keto acid loses a water molecule, it would form a ketone. So, the product would have one less O (since each water has O, but maybe the keto acid loses H2O and forms a double bond).

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an anhydride, but that would have more O's.

Wait, I'm not sure about this part. Let's go back to the first reaction.

Assuming W is CO2, which is produced when a carbonate reacts with an acid. So Y could be an acid, X a carbonate. So, for example, CaCO3 (X) reacts with HCl (Y) to produce CO2 (W), CaCl2 (G, which is a precipitate?), but wait, CaCl2 is soluble. Hmm, maybe MgCO3 reacting with HCl: MgCO3 + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. So the precipitate might not form here. Unless Y is a weak acid and X is a carbonate of a weak base, which would form a precipitate.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a strong acid like H2SO4, and X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble sulfate. For example, CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 (precipitate) + CO2↑ + H2O. So G would be CaSO4, which is a precipitate. When heated, what happens to CaSO4? It's quite stable, doesn't decompose easily. So maybe B is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a hydroxide. For instance, if X is a metal hydroxide and Y is an acid. Then the reaction would produce water and a salt. But then the precipitate might not form. Hmm.

Wait, if W is CO2, and the precipitate G is something that upon heating gives B with a melting point near 277 K, maybe B is something like sodium chloride? No, NaCl melts at 801°C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is not a solid. Wait, melting point is 277 K, which is a solid. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide. But then, B would be the metal oxide. Hmm, but then the melting point of the metal oxide would be high, not near 4°C.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the keto acid reaction. The product has two oxygen atoms. So, the keto acid has a keto group (like O=C-O) and a carboxylic acid group. When it reacts with X, it forms a product with two O atoms. Maybe the reaction is an oxidation or reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent. For example, X could be D2O (deuterated water) acting as a solvent or catalyst in some reaction, but I'm not sure how that would tie in.

Wait, another thought: The product of the keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is an ester, which has two oxygen atoms in the ester group. So, for example, if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid and it reacts with X (maybe an alcohol) to form an ester. But in that case, X would be an alcohol, but how does that tie into the other reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base like NaOH. But then, reacting with the keto acid would form a salt and water. But the product would have more O atoms.

Wait, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent. Common ones are like P2O5 or H2SO4. If X is H2SO4, then it could be used in the dehydration of the keto acid to form an ester. For example, acetoacetic acid upon dehydration with H2SO4 would form an anhydride or a ketone. Wait, but the product needs to have two O atoms. So, maybe it's forming an ester with two O's? Not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the elements in X. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X must be composed of at least two different elements, one of which is a heavier isotope. For instance, maybe X has hydrogen and deuterium (but deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen, so it's the same element). Or perhaps X has oxygen and another element with a heavier isotope.

Wait, if X is D2O, then its elements are H (as D) and O. The lightest element is H (with mass 1), the heaviest is O (16). So cumulative atomic masses would be 1 +16 =17. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the possible identity of X. Since X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry, perhaps X is something like DMSO (CH3SOCH3), which is a polar aprotic solvent. DMSO has a sulfur atom. So, elements in X would be C, H (as D), O, S. The lightest element would be H (mass 1), and the heaviest is S (32). So cumulative masses would be 1 +32=33. Not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: X is a chlorinated compound. But then, the isotopes would be Cl-35 and Cl-37. But the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope, so perhaps Cl-37.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, like sodium or potassium. But if X is Na, and one of its isotopes is heavier (like Na-23 and Na-24?), but Na mostly has Na-23. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the initial reaction again. If W is CO2, and the precipitate G is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid, but then when G is heated, B is formed. So, if G is a carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and the metal oxide. But B has a melting point near 277 K. Hmm. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, perhaps it decomposes into the metal oxide and water. But then B would be the metal oxide, which has a high melting point. Not matching.

Wait, another idea. Maybe the precipitate G is a sulfide. When heated, it might decompose into the metal sulfide and something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let's think about B's melting point. 277 K is about 4°C. What substances have a melting point around there? Maybe something like camphor? No, camphor has a higher melting point. Alternatively, maybe a certain type of alcohol? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: What if B is a diatomic molecule with a triple bond, like O2 or N2? O2 has a melting point of around 54.36 K (-218°C), which is way lower than 277 K. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is solid carbon dioxide (dry ice)? No, dry ice sublimes at 195 K. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a salt that's a hydrate. For example, Na2CO3·H2O. The melting point of such a hydrate might be around that temperature. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is ammonium nitrate. But NH4NO3 decomposes when heated. Hmm.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to think about the possible elements in X. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Looking at the options: 25, 29, 31, 35.

25 is close to the sum of 1 (H) and 24 (Mg). 29 could be 1 (H) + 28 (Si). 31 could be 1 (H) +30 (something else). Or 1 + 16 (O) + something else.

Wait, another approach: The product of the reaction with a keto acid has 2 O atoms. So perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form a double bond, reducing the number of O's. Wait, the keto acid has two O's in the keto group and another in the carboxylic acid. So maybe the product loses two O's, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an oxidation. Wait, maybe X is a strong oxidizing agent. For example, KMnO4. But then, the product would have more O atoms.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester, which has two O's. So, for example, if the keto acid reacts with an alcohol (X) to form an ester. So X would be an alcohol. If X is CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but if X uses a heavier isotope, like CH3CH2OD, then the elements are C, H, and O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). So sum is 17, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The product of the keto acid with X has two O's. So maybe it's something like an ether, which has two O's. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a halogen, like Cl, but then the product would have a Cl in it.

Hmm, perhaps X is a transition metal. For example, if X is Fe, but then the reaction with Y would produce something else.

Wait, let's think about the initial part again. X reacts with Y, a liquid, to produce gas W (with equal protons and neutrons), precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. B's melting point is near 277 K.

So, if W is CO2, and G is a carbonate, which when heated produces B, but I'm not seeing how that leads to a melting point near 277 K.

Alternatively, perhaps W is H2O, but earlier that didn't fit. Or maybe W is O2, which would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons.

Wait, another angle: The product with the keto acid has two O atoms. So, the product could be something like an anhydride, but that would have more O's. Alternatively, the product could be a ketone, which has one O. Hmm, not two.

Wait, maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck on this. So perhaps I should look for the possible answer by elimination.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Let's think about possible elements that sum up to these numbers.

Option B is 25. That could be 1 (H) + 24 (Mg). So if X has H and Mg, perhaps.

Option D is 29: 1 (H) + 28 (Si). But Si is not a common element in such reactions. Alternatively, 2 (He) + 27 (Al) = 29. But He is a noble gas, unlikely in this context.

Option C is 31: Maybe 1 (H) +30 (something). But 30 is Zn, which is possible. So H and Zn: 1 +65.5 (approx) =66.5, which isn't 31. Hmm, wait, maybe another combination. 31 could be 16 (O) + 15 (P) =31. So if X has O and P, then their masses would sum to 16 +31 =47. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps X contains C and O. C is 12, O is 16, sum is 28. Not an option.

Wait another approach: What if X is a diatomic molecule with two different isotopes, like H2O (but one O is a heavier isotope, like O-18). So the elements are H and O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps X is something like NaOH. Elements are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option.

Wait, another idea: If X is a chloroform derivative, like CHCl3. Then elements are C, H, Cl. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 1 +35.5 =36.5. Close to option A (35). But wait, the problem says to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes present. So if X has Cl, which has isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl, then the sum would be 35 +37 =72. Plus H (1) and C (12). So total sum would be 72 +12 +1=85. That's way higher than any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's think of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Suppose X contains O and another element. If the other element is S (32), then sum is 16 +32=48. Not an option. If it's Cl (35), sum is 16 +35=51. Still not matching.

Wait, another possibility: The lightest and heaviest elements are H and O. Sum is 1 +16=17. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the heaviest is O (16), and lightest is C (12). Sum is 28. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X contains C and O. Sum is 12 +16=28. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains O and F. F is 19, O is 16. Sum is 35. That's option A. So 16 +19=35.

So, if X has O and F, their masses sum to 35. So the cumulative atomic masses would be 16 +19=35, which is option A.

But does X have O and F? If X is something like OF2 or something else. But then, when X reacts with Y, what would happen?

Wait, another thought: X could be a peroxide, like H2O2, but then it's H and O. Their sum is 1 +16=17.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a halogenated hydrocarbon, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is something like Cl2O7 (chlorate), but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like CH3Cl, where Cl is a heavier isotope. Then elements are C, H, and Cl. The lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35). So sum is 1 +35=36. Closest option is A)35.

Hmm, but the options are given as A)35, which is close.

Alternatively, if X is a compound like CCl2F2, which is a Freon. Then, elements are C, Cl, F. The lightest is C (12), heaviest Cl (35) or F (19). Wait, F is lighter than Cl, so heaviest is Cl. So sum is 12 +35=47. Not an option.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look back at the reaction parts again.

The product of the reaction with a keto acid has 2 O atoms. So, perhaps X is a strong base like NaOH, which when reacted with a keto acid forms a salt and water. But NaOH's elements are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like an ester, which has two O atoms. So, if X is an alcohol, and the reaction is esterification. Then, X's elements would be C, H, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17.

No, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe X is a metal carbonate. Suppose X is Na2CO3. Elements: Na, C, O. So, Na is 23, C is 12, O is 16. The lightest is C (12), heaviest Na (23). Sum 12 +23=35. That's option A.

Ah, wait! If X is Na2CO3, then the elements present are Na, C, O. The lightest atom is C (12), the heaviest is Na (23). So cumulative atomic masses are 12 +23 =35. So option A is 35.

Does this fit the reaction?

So, X is Na2CO3. Let's see the reaction with Y (liquid). Na2CO3 reacts with an acid Y (like HCl) to produce CO2 (W), NaCl (G, a precipitate?), but wait, NaCl is soluble. Hmm, perhaps Y is a weak acid, so the reaction produces a precipitate.

Wait, for example, if Y is acetic acid (CH3COOH), then Na2CO3 + 2 CH3COOH → 2 CH3COONa + CO2↑ + H2O. CH3COONa is soluble, so precipitate G might not form. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which would react with Na2CO3 to produce CO2, Na2SO4, and water. Na2SO4 is soluble in water, so again, no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a nitric acid. Same issue, as nitrates are soluble. So perhaps Y is a different acid that produces an insoluble salt. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce CaCl2, which is soluble. So precipitate G wouldn't form. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternative approach: What if the precipitate G is a carbonate reacting with an acid to form CO2 and a precipitate of another compound. Wait, maybe the acid is not strong, leading to a carbonate precipitate. Not sure.

But regardless, if X is Na2CO3, the cumulative atomic masses would be 12 (C) +23 (Na) =35, which is option A.

So, the answer would be A)35.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts with Liquid Y to produce Gas W, Precipitate G, and ultimately Compound B upon heating. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K, and the reaction of a keto acid with X produces a product containing 2 oxygen atoms. Additionally, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. This suggests W could be CO₂, as it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. CO₂ is a plausible product of a reaction involving a carbonate and an acid.

2. **Precipitate G**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (~4°C). This suggests B could be a compound with a relatively low melting point, possibly a hydrated salt or a specific oxide.

3. **Reaction of X with a Keto Acid**: The product of this reaction contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies X could be a reagent like Na₂CO₃, which reacts with acids to form salts, water, and CO₂. The product of the reaction with a keto acid could involve dehydration or esterification, forming a compound with 2 oxygen atoms.

4. **Elements in X**: Assuming X is Na₂CO₃, the elements present are Na, C, and O. The lightest element is C (atomic mass ≈ 12), and the heaviest is Na (atomic mass ≈ 23). The cumulative atomic masses of these elements sum to 12 + 23 = 35.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 35**: Matches the cumulative atomic masses of C (12) and Na (23) in Na₂CO₃.
   - **B) 25**: Could correspond to H (1) and Mg (24), but this does not fit the context of X.
   - **C) 31**: Could correspond to O (16) and P (15), but this is not relevant to X.
   - **D) 29**: Could correspond to H (1) and Si (28), but this is also not relevant to X.
