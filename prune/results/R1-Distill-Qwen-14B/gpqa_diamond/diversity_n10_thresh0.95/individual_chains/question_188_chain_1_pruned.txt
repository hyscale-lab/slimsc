Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral is one of the crystal structures, right? It's kind of a distorted cube or something. The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think I need to use some formula from crystallography for this.

The given parameters are the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice is defined by three vectors of equal length a, with all angles equal. So that makes sense here.

I remember there's a formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in terms of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. The formula is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl)cosθ ), but wait, no, that's only for cubic systems, right? Or is it more general? Wait, no, I think that formula is for orthorhombic systems. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Or perhaps it's the general case where all angles are the same.

Wait, for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance formula is d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cosβ - 2hl cosγ - 2kl cosα )) ), or something like that. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, right, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cosβ + hl cosγ + kl cosα)/(a²)

Wait, is that right? Or is it a different arrangement? Another thought: for a rhombohedral system, since all angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma = θ), maybe the formula simplifies. Let me try to recall. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula specific to a rhombohedral structure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure factor or the Miller indices. Another approach: since the structure is rhombohedral, perhaps it's more straightforward to model the lattice vectors and compute the plane distance.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice can be considered as a cube that's been stretched along a certain direction, but all sides are equal. So the unit cell vectors a, b, c have the same length 'a', and the angles between each pair are 30 degrees.

The (111) plane corresponds to the plane that cuts the lattice vectors at (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. Or wait, more accurately, the interplanar distance d is given by 1/(h² + k² + l²)^(1/2) multiplied by something? No, that's for a simple cubic structure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing:

d_{hkl} = (1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) ) * a

But wait, that's only valid when all angles are equal and each is theta. Since in this case, alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2(hk cos gamma)/(a b) - 2(hl cos beta)/(a c) - 2(kl cos alpha)/(b c)

But in this case, since it's a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c = interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So substituting, a = b = c = 10, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So the formula simplifies to:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2[ hk cos 30 + hl cos 30 + kl cos 30 ] / (a²)

Because a = b = c, the denominator in each cross term becomes a^2, since (a*b)=a^2, etc.

Wait, wait. Let me re-examine the formula. The cross terms involve cosines of the angles between the axes. So for a rhombohedral system, the angle between a and b is alpha, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is gamma. Since all are 30 degrees, then:

cos(alpha) = cos(beta) = cos(gamma) = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So for the general formula, the 1/d² would be:

1/d² = [h² + k² + l²]/(a^2) - 2[ hk cos(alpha) + hl cos(beta) + kl cos(gamma) ] / (a^2)

But since alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees, and a = b = c, this simplifies to:

1/d² = [h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos(30) - 2 hl cos(30) - 2 kl cos(30)] / (a^2)

Which can be factored as:

1/d² = [ (h - k cos30)^2 + (k - h cos30)^2 + (l^2)(1 - 2 cos30) ) ] / (a^2)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it differently.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the numerator for the (111) plane. So h=1, k=1, l=1.

So numerator becomes:

(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) - 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 )

Which is 3 - 2*(3 * (√3/2)) 

Because each of the three cross terms is 1*1 * cos30, so sum is 3 * (√3/2).

So 3 - 2*( (3√3)/2 )

Simplify: 3 - 3√3.

Wait, so 1/d² = [3 - 3√3 ] / (a^2)

Wait, a is given as 10 Angstroms, so a²=100.

So 1/d² = (3(1 - √3 )) / 100.

Wait, but wait a second. 3 - 3√3 is approximately 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. Which is negative. Oh no, that can't be right because 1/d² can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let me re-calculate the numerator:

The general formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha ) / a².

Wait, wait no. The formula is 1/d² = [h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)] / a².

Wait, is that correct? Or was it 2 multiplied by hk cos(180 - alpha) or something? Hmm, perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake in the formula. Let me try to look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't do that now. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the structure of the formula.

Wait, each cross term in the denominator is 2 times the product of the indices times the cosine of the angle between the respective axes. For example, the term for hk would be 2hk cos(theta), where theta is the angle between a and b axes, which is 30 degrees. So in our case, all angles are 30 degrees.

So, the numerator for (111) would be:

(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) - 2*( 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 )

Which is 3 - 2*(3*(√3/2)).

Let me compute that:

3 - 2*(3*(√3/2)) = 3 - 3√3.

Which is approximately 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

But that's negative, which can't happen because 1/d² can't be negative. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Oh wait! Wait a second. The formula for 1/d² is:

[ h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ] divided by (a²).

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the lattice vectors are alpha, beta, gamma. So for a rhombohedral system, the angle between a and b is alpha, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is gamma. So all are 30 degrees.

So, substituting:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So numerator is 3 - 2[ (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) ].

Which is 3 - 2*(3 * (√3/2)).

Which is 3 - 3√3 ≈ 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that can't be. Maybe I messed up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the reciprocal is different.

Wait, another thought: in the formula, maybe the cross terms are 2 times hk cos(alpha) but with a negative sign. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the general formula, the denominator in the reciprocal space is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) / a².

So in this case, yes, it's 3 - 2*(3*(√3/2)).

So 3 - 3√3 is negative, which is impossible. So something is wrong here.

Hmm, perhaps I have the wrong formula. Wait, another thought: maybe the angles are not alpha, but 180 - alpha. Because in some conventions, the angles are considered as the angles inside the lattice, but perhaps they are the supplementary angles?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses the cosines of the angles, but in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe I should compute the interplanar distance using vectors. Let me try that approach.

The (111) plane is defined by the plane that intercepts the lattice vectors a, b, c at (1,1,1). The normal vector to this plane can be found using the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector g for (hkl) is given by:

g = (h a* + k b* + l c*),

where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

The interplanar distance d is 1/|g|.

But for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = a0, and all angles equal to theta, the reciprocal vectors can be simplified.

Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vectors for a rhombohedral system can be expressed in terms of the primitive vectors.

Wait, perhaps I can find the expression for |g|².

|g|² = h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos(theta) - 2 hl cos(theta) - 2 kl cos(theta)

Wait, that's the same expression as before. So yes, that brings us back to the same point. So the numerator is 3 - 3√3, which is negative.

That can't be, so I'm making a mistake somewhere. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the formula uses cos(180 - theta) instead of cos(theta), or maybe I have the angles wrong.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the angles between the lattice vectors are 30 degrees. But wait, in some crystal systems, the angles in the formula might be the angles between the reciprocal vectors, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal axes, which might be different.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe I can compute the volume of the unit cell and then find the reciprocal vectors.

The volume of the unit cell, V, is a^3 times the square root of 1 + 2 cos(theta) + 2 cos^2(theta) + ... Wait, no, the volume for a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 times sqrt(1 + 2cos(alpha) + 2cos^2(alpha)), but that might not be correct. Wait, wait, the volume is given by a * b * c * sqrt(1 - cos²(alpha) - cos²(beta) - cos²(gamma) + 2 cos(alpha) cos(beta) cos(gamma)) )^(1/2). But for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta. So the volume V = a0^3 * sqrt( 1 - 3 cos²(theta) + 2 cos³(theta) )^(1/2) ?

Wait, maybe I should compute it correctly. The volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is given by V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos²(alpha) - cos²(beta) - cos²(gamma) + 2 cos(alpha) cos(beta) cos(gamma)) )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 + 2 cos(alpha) cos(beta) cos(gamma) - cos²(alpha) - cos²(beta) - cos²(gamma)) )

So substituting alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

Compute each term:

cos(30) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So compute:

1 + 2*(√3/2)^3 - 3*( (√3/2)^2 )

Wait, wait, let's compute:

First term: 1

Second term: 2*( cos(alpha) cos(beta) cos(gamma) ) = 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) = 2*( 3√3/(8) ) ) = (3√3/4) ≈ 1.2990.

Third term: -3*(cos^2(theta)) = -3*( (3/4) ) = -9/4 ≈ -2.25.

So total: 1 + 1.2990 - 2.25 = (1 + 1.299) is 2.299, minus 2.25 is ≈ 0.049.

Wait, that's a very small number. The square root of that is sqrt(0.049) ≈ 0.221.

So volume V = a^3 * 0.221. But a is 10 A, so a^3 is 1000. So V = 1000 * 0.221 ≈ 221 Angstrom^3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is helping me find the interplanar distance. I'm trying to find d for (111), but perhaps it's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the reciprocal formula. But I'm stuck because the numerator is giving a negative value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me re-express the formula.

The correct formula for 1/d² is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2/(a²) [ hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha ]

In this problem, a = 10 A, h=k=l=1, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So substituting:

1/d² = (1 + 1 + 1)/(10)^2 - 2/(10)^2 [ (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 ]

Which is 3/100 - 2/100 * (3 * (√3/2) )

Simplify:

3/100 - (6/100) * (√3/2 )

Which is 3/100 - (3√3)/100.

So 1/d² = (3 - 3√3 ) / 100.

Wait, that's (3(1 -√3 )) / 100.

But 1 -√3 is approximately 1 - 1.732 = -0.732. So 3 * (-0.732) = -2.196.

So 1/d² = (-2.196) / 100 → -0.02196.

Wait, 1/d squared is negative, which is impossible. So I must have messed up the formula.

Hmm, perhaps the formula uses the angles with a different sign. Or, perhaps the formula was actually:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2/(a²) [ hk cos(alpha) + ... ]

Wait, no. Let me think. Maybe I have the formula wrong, perhaps the cross terms are subtracted.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) / a^2 - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) / a^2.

Which is what I had before.

So perhaps in this case, the interplanar distance for (111) is imaginary, which is impossible. So maybe I've made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the angles are not 30 degrees, but 150 degrees. Because in some cases, the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal vectors, which might be 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. Let me try that.

So if alpha = beta = gamma = 150 degrees, then cos(alpha) = cos(150) = -√3/2 ≈ -0.866.

So substituting:

1/d² = (3) / (10^2) - 2/(10^2) [ 1*1*(-√3/2) + 1*1*(-√3/2) + 1*1*(-√3/2) ]

So that becomes 3/100 - 2/100 [ -3√3/2 ]

Which is 3/100 + (3√3)/100.

Because 2*(3√3/2) = 3√3, and with the negative inside, it becomes -2 * (-3√3/2) → +3√3.

So 3/100 + (3√3)/100 → (3 + 3√3 ) / 100.

Which is approximately (3 + 5.196)/100 → 8.196/100 → 0.08196.

So 1/d² = 0.08196 → d² = 1/0.08196 ≈ 12.206 → d ≈ sqrt(12.206) ≈ 3.492 A.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. The options are around 8 to 10 Angstroms.

Hmm, that suggests that even with 150 degrees, the d value is way too small. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be using a different approach. Let me think about the interatomic distance.

Wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 A. So the lattice parameter a is 10 A? Or is it the distance between atoms along the cube diagonal or something else?

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms, which could be along the edges of the unit cell. But in a rhombohedral lattice, each atom is located at the vertices of the rhombohedron. So the distance between adjacent atoms is 'a', the lattice parameter. So a would be 10 A.

Wait, but in that case, the interplanar distance calculation would proceed as before. But that brings us back to the same problem.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to compute the reciprocal of d squared again, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's re-express the formula. The formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) / a².

Wait, in our case, with h=k=l=1 and all angles 30 degrees:

= (3) - 2 [ 3*(
