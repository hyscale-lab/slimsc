Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. They represent this operator as a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and figure out which of the given statements is correct.

Hmm, wait. So the operator A_y is given by c multiplied by the matrix S. Let me first write down what S looks like. So S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Right, and c is h/(4π). So A_y = c * S.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, spin matrices are often scaled. For example, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used to represent spin-1/2 particles. The Pauli sigma matrices, like sigma_y, is given by:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Wait, that's exactly what S is here. So S is sigma_y. And the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle is S = (ħ/2) sigma, where sigma are the Pauli matrices. So, for the angular momentum operator in the y-direction, the component is usually written as S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So in this problem, A_y is c times S, and c is h/(4π). Wait, but h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). Let me compute c: c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. Oh wait, because h = 2π ħ. So h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So c is ħ/(2). Therefore, A_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So A_y is exactly the standard S_y operator for spin-1/2 particles. 

So, considering that, the eigenvalues of S_y (which are A_y's eigenvalues) are plus and minus ħ/2. Because for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of the spin components are ± ħ/2. So that's the eigenvalues. But wait, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which seems way too big. Option B mentions imaginary parts being ±1/2 and real ±1. That seems off because the eigenvalues for A_y should be real, as it's an observable. Because angular momentum components are hermitian operators, so their eigenvalues (which are the possible measured values) must be real.

So wait, if A_y is a Hermitian operator, its eigenvalues should be real. So any option that suggests eigenvalues with non-zero imaginary parts should be incorrect. Looking at the options:

Option A: Im parts are ±2πh, Re parts are h/(4π) or -h/(4π). Wait, but c is h/(4π), and the eigenvalues are ±c*(ħ/2?), wait no, wait, earlier calculation, A_y is (ħ/2)*sigma_y, so the eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * (±1), so ± ħ/2. Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), so substituting, ± (h/(2π))/2 = ± h/(4π). So eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So they are real, no imaginary parts. So the eigenvalues of A_y are real, ± h/(4π).

So let's look at the options again. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh — that can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. Similarly, option B mentions imaginary parts, which would be incorrect. So options A and B are probably wrong because they have imaginary parts. So only options C and D are left.

Option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. Hmm. Well, for angular momentum operators, in quantum mechanics, the square of the angular momentum (A²) commutes with each component (Ay, Az, etc.), so they share eigenfunctions. So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's also an eigenfunction of A². Because A² and Ay commute. So option C says that the eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A², which is correct. But it says it cannot be an eigenfunction of Az. That's not necessarily true. Because, for example, the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be expressed as eigenfunctions of Az if they are simultaneous eigenvectors, but for spin-1/2, the maximum set of commuting observables is either diagonal in the same basis. But in reality, Ay and Az do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So a function can't be an eigenfunction of both Ay and Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenfunction, which for spin-1/2, the eigenfunctions of Ay are different from those of Az. So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not an eigenfunction of Az. So option C's second part is correct. Therefore, the statement in option C is correct. So that makes option C a possible correct answer.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm. The basis functions of the matrix operator would probably refer to the eigenbasis. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of Ay. So in that sense, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay's operator. So option D's statement is correct as well. But wait, let me think again. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvectors, which form a basis for C². So any vector in that space can be expressed as a combination of the eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the operator. So option D's statement is correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. The operator is acting on a two-dimensional space, so yes, its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is a correct statement.

But let's go back to the options. Which statement is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay? Let's reevaluate each option.

Option A: Im parts are ±2πh, Re parts ±h/(4π). But earlier calculation shows eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So this is wrong. Because the eigenvalues are real, not having imaginary parts.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, real ±1. No, same reasoning. The eigenvalues are real.

Options C and D are the possible correct ones.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. As I thought earlier, A² and Ay commute, so their eigenvectors are same. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But for Az, since it doesn't commute with Ay, their eigenfunctions are different, so the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space (since it's 2x2 and diagonalizable if the eigenvalues are distinct, which they are here: ±h/(4π) are distinct). So the eigenfunctions form a basis, and any vector can be written as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So both C and D might be correct? Or am I missing something?

Wait, let's look more carefully at option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, perhaps the wording is a bit ambiguous. What does it mean by "basis functions of the matrix operator Ay"? The matrix operator is a linear operator, and its eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the vector space it's acting on. So yes, the statement in D is correct.

But then, why are both C and D correct? Or maybe only one is correct. Let's re-examine.

Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the eigenvalues again. The matrix S is sigma_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. So c * sigma_y would have eigenvalues c * (±1). c is h/(4π). So eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So they are real, as expected.

So for option C, the eigenfunctions of Ay (eigenfunctions of sigma_y) are also eigenfunctions of A² because A² = (c sigma)^2 = c² sigma^2. Since sigma^2 is identity matrix (because sigma matrices square to identity), so sigma_y squared is identity. So A² = c² I, which is a multiple of the identity matrix. The identity matrix commutes with any operator, so any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A². So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So yes, because the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the space. So D's statement is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one option is correct. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. Basis functions usually refer to the functions used to express the operator, like the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. But in this case, the eigenvectors are the basis. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the statements made during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps option D is correct because when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form the basis, so the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

But earlier I thought that option C is correct as well. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the answer options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². Let me think again: A² is c² times S². Since S is sigma_y, S² is I (identity matrix). So A² = c² I. The identity matrix has all vectors as eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A², regardless of being an eigenfunction of Ay. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², because A² is a multiple of the identity. So for any vector phi, A² phi = c² phi. So phi is an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue c². Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct.

But option C's second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Az is another component of the angular momentum, and the different components don't commute, their eigenvectors are different. So a vector can't be an eigenvector of both Ay and Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate. So option C's statement is correct.

So both C and D could be correct. But the options are presented as multiple-choice, so only one can be correct. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the options.

Wait, looking at option D: "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the matrix operator is 2x2, and its basis is the set of eigenvectors. So the statement is correct. So D is correct.

So the problem is to choose between options C and D. Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So, let me think about what each option is saying.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct, as discussed.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D are correct? But the options usually have only one correct. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting Option D.

Wait, the question is about the matrix operator Ay. The basis functions of the matrix operator would probably refer to the basis in which the operator is expressed. For example, the standard basis for 2x2 matrices is the computational basis, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, when the operator is diagonal, the eigenvectors form the basis.

So in this case, the matrix Ay, which is c * S, has eigenvectors that form an orthonormal basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator, meaning that any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. So D's statement is correct.

So if both C and D are correct, perhaps the options are misleading. But looking at the options again, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me think about what each statement implies.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². That is correct because A² is a multiple of identity, so every eigenfunction is also an eigenfunction of A². So that's correct.

But the second part of C says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Az doesn't commute with Ay, their eigenvectors are different. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So both parts are correct.

So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions. That's correct, as the eigenvectors form a basis.

So if the question allows for multiple correct options, but in this case, it's a multiple-choice, so only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps one of the options is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the eigenvalues for A_y. Let me re-calculate.

A_y is c times S, where c = h/(4π). S is sigma_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, A_y has eigenvalues c*(±1) = ±h/(4π). So these are real values. So the eigenvalues are real, no imaginary parts. So options A and B are incorrect.

So when considering the statements made during the calculation, the correct statements are about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Looking again at the options, option C and D are correct. But the question provides four options, and only one is correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the statement in option D is incorrect. Because the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis, not the eigenbasis. Maybe the statement in D is incorrect. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the operator matrix. Wait, the basis functions are usually the functions that form the basis for the vector space in which the operator acts. So if the operator acts on a vector space with basis vectors |+> and |-> (eigenstates of Ay), then these are the basis functions (eigenvectors) of the operator. Therefore, option D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in D is correct, but the other options are incorrect. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C and D, but since only one option can be correct, perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of A^2. Let me compute A².

A_y = c·S, where S is sigma_y. So S squared is S^2 = sigma_y^2. Since each Pauli matrix squares to the identity matrix, sigma_y^2 = I. So A² = (c S)^2 = c^2 S^2 = c^2 I.

So any vector is an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue c². So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, then phi is also an eigenfunction of A². So option C's first part is correct.

But for option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. The operator is Ay, which is a 2x2 matrix. The basis functions in this context would be the eigenvectors of Ay, which are orthogonal and form a basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

Hmm. So both C and D are correct statements. But since the options don't allow for multiple correct answers, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Let's see what each option says.

Option A) Im parts are ±2πh, Re parts ±h/(4π). → wrong because eigenvalues are real.

Option B) Im parts ±1/2, Re ±1. → wrong.

Option C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. → correct.

Option D) Eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of Ay. → correct.

So both C and D are correct. But the question gives four options, each with a letter, so perhaps only one is correct. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the question says "which statement below will you consider to be correct." So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking again, perhaps the statements are not entirely correct.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator is a 2x2 matrix, its matrix representation in the standard basis (computational basis) is given. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form a different basis (eigenbasis). So, when you diagonalize the matrix, the eigenfunctions form the basis. So the statement in D is correct.

But perhaps the question is about whether the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors of the operator's matrix. So, in the standard basis, the operator's matrix is not diagonal, but in the eigenbasis, it is diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors of the operator in its eigenbasis. So D's statement is correct.

Hmm, but the options present C and D as separate choices. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the matrix operator is given as 2x2. The eigenfunctions are vectors in that space, so they form a basis. So D is correct. But C is also correct. So maybe both C and D are correct, but perhaps the intended correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Let me think about option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the "basis functions" of the matrix operator might refer to the functions that form the basis in which Ay is represented as a matrix. But for a 2x2 matrix, the standard basis is the computational basis, which are the eigenvectors of the Pauli z matrix. So if Ay is expressed in the standard basis (eigenbasis of sigma_z), then the basis functions are different from the eigenvectors of Ay. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not the same as the basis functions of the operator in the standard basis. Therefore, option D's statement would be incorrect.

Ah! That's a good point. So the matrix operator Ay is expressed in the standard basis, which is the eigenbasis of sigma_z (for example, |+z> and |-z> states). The eigenfunctions of Ay are the eigenvectors of Ay, which form a different basis, the eigenbasis of Ay. So the eigenfunctions φ are not the same as the basis functions in which the operator is written. Therefore, option D's statement is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the operator's matrix. Instead, they form a different basis.

So that makes option D incorrect. I think I made a mistake earlier. Therefore, the correct statement is option C.

So which statements are correct:

- Option C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves analyzing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \). The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) (or \( \sigma_y \)) has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), which simplifies to \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, as \( A_y \) is a Hermitian operator.

2. **Option A:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are entirely real, with no imaginary components.

3. **Option B:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm
