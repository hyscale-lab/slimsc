Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei or something. But the question is about a specific nucleus, X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has 3 protons normally. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh, right, the energy here is the kinetic energy, I think. Because when we talk about particles moving at relativistic speeds, the energy usually refers to their kinetic energy.

So I need to calculate the kinetic energy when the speed v is 0.96 times the speed of light. The formula for relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m0c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First, let's find gamma. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². Let me calculate that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think. Hmm, 0.28² is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 equals approximately 3.5714. Wait, 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1 divided by 7/25 is 25/7, which is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is 25/7 or about 3.5714. Now, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m0c². So I need to find m0, the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

What's the mass of Li-6? Well, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c², and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². So let me compute the total mass.

3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 GeV/c².
3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 GeV/c².
Total m0c² is 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV.

Wait, is that right? Oh, because each proton and neutron's mass is given as about 1 GeV/c², but the exact numbers vary. Maybe I should use the exact masses or approximate values. Alternatively, perhaps I should just use the mass number for the nucleus, but wait, the mass isn't exactly the sum of protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh, but since we're dealing with a heavy ion, the rest mass would be approximately the sum, but perhaps I should just proceed with the given values.

Wait, another approach: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but that's a rough approximation. But wait, the exact mass of the Li-6 isotope is more accurately known. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass given in the problem or perhaps the molar mass in some way. But I think the problem expects me to use the approximate values for protons and neutrons.

Wait, let's compute it properly. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², right? So 938 * 1e-3 GeV/c². So 1.007276 GeV/c² per proton, correct. Neutrons are a bit heavier. 1.008665 GeV/c² each.

So 3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 GeV/c².

3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 GeV/c².

Total is 6.047823 GeV/c².

So m0c² is 6.047823 GeV.

Now, gamma is approximately 3.5714. So gamma -1 is 2.5714.

So the kinetic energy is 2.5714 * 6.047823 GeV.

Let me compute that: 2.5714 *6. Let's see, 2.5 *6 is 15, 0.0714 *6 is ~0.428, so roughly 15.428? But more accurately, let's compute 2.5714 * 6.047823.

Let me compute 2 * 6.047823 =12.095646.

0.5714 *6.047823 = ?

0.5 *6.047823 = 3.0239115.

0.0714 *6.047823 ≈ 0.4313 (since 6.047823 * 0.07 is approximately 0.423, and 0.0014 *6.047 is 0.008466, so total about 0.431.

So 3.0239 +0.431 = 3.4549.

Total is 12.0956 +3.4549 =15.5505 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me do it more precisely.

2.5714 *6.047823.

Alternatively, 2.5714 *6 = 15.4284.

2.5714 *0.047823 ≈ ?

0.047823 is approximately 0.0478. So 2.5714 *0.0478.

Let me compute 2 * 0.0478=0.0956.

0.5 *0.0478=0.0239.

0.0714 *0.0478≈0.00341.

Adding up: 0.0956 +0.0239=0.1195, plus 0.00341 is 0.1229. So 2.5714 *0.047823 ≈ 0.1229.

So total KE is 15.4284 +0.1229 ≈15.5513 GeV.

Wait, that's about 15.55 GeV. But looking at the options, none of them are around 15.5. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, so none of these are near 15.5. So maybe I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of about 6 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So 6 u is about 5.589 GeV/c². Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation of about 6.047 GeV. So which is correct?

Ah, I see. The exact mass includes binding energy, so the mass of the nucleus is actually slightly less than the sum of individual nucleons because the binding energy is negative (mass defect). So, the mass of Li-6 is about 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV/c².

Wait, but earlier, when I added protons and neutrons, I got 6.047 GeV, which is higher. So this is where I went wrong. I should have used the actual mass of the nucleus, not the sum of the individual nucleon masses.

So let me recalculate the mass. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6 * 0.9315 GeV/c²? Wait, no, because 1 u is 0.9315 GeV/c². So 6 u is 5.589 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is actually 6.0105 atomic mass units. Wait, perhaps I should look up the precise mass. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass as 6 u, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think. The mass of a nucleus is given by Z * m_p + (N-Z)*m_n - binding energy. But maybe for this problem, we can approximate the rest mass as m0 = mass number * m_u, where m_u is the atomic mass unit in GeV/c².

So the mass number A of Li-6 is 6. So m0c² =6 * 0.9315 =5.589 GeV.

So that brings m0c² down to about 5.589 GeV.

So then, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) * m0c² = (3.5714 - 1) * 5.589 GeV.

Wait, no: the formula is (gamma -1) * m0 c². So gamma is 3.5714, so gamma minus 1 is 2.5714. Multiply by m0c² which is 5.589 GeV: 2.5714 *5.589.

Let me compute that: 2 *5.589=11.178, 0.5714 *5.589 ≈ 3.195. So total is 14.373 GeV.

Still not matching the options. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the definition of energy. The total energy is gamma m0 c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m0 c². So I must have that right.

Wait, what's the mass of the Li-6 nucleus accurately? Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0105 atomic mass units. Because I remember that the binding energy for Li-6 is about 6 * 0.9315 GeV = 5.589 GeV, but the actual mass is less. Wait, no, the mass is equal to the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact mass of Li-6 in GeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps the mass can be calculated using the atomic mass. Let me recall that the mass of a nucleus is A * u * c², where u is the atomic mass unit (1 u = 1.6605e-27 kg), but that's perhaps not helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps the mass can be found by the formula: M = (Z * m_p + N * m_n) - binding energy.

But I don't have the exact binding energy for Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as m = (number of protons + number of neutrons) * average mass, but that's a rough approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the rest mass as (A) times 1 GeV/c², but that's just an approximation. Wait, I think I'll have to proceed with the initial approach, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the total energy, not the kinetic energy, but the question says 'energy of the collider', which is the kinetic energy per particle. Or maybe the total, but I think it's kinetic.

Wait, the problem statement says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." The energy for the collider would be the kinetic energy, because the rest mass energy is already present. So I think I was right to calculate the kinetic energy.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma.

v = 0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c^2.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 ≈3.5714.

That's correct.

So gamma is 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy m0c² is 6.0105 u * 0.9315 GeV/u ≈ 6 *0.9315 =5.589 GeV.

Wait, but 6.0105 u is more precise. Let me compute 6.0105 * 0.9315 GeV.

6 *0.9315 =5.589 GeV.

0.0105 *0.9315 ≈ 0.00978 GeV.

So total is approximately 5.589 + 0.00978 ≈5.5988 GeV.

So m0c² ≈5.5988 GeV.

So the kinetic energy (KE) is (gamma -1) * m0c² = (3.5714 -1) *5.5988 ≈2.5714 *5.5988.

Let me calculate 2 *5.5988 =11.1976.

0.5714 *5.5988 ≈ 3.2 (approximating), but let's do precise calculation.

0.5 *5.5988 = 2.7994.

0.0714 *5.5988: 0.07 *5.5988=0.3919, 0.0014 *5.5988=0.007838. So total 0.3997.

So 2.7994 + 0.3997 =3.1991.

Total KE: 11.1976 +3.1991 =14.3967 GeV ≈14.4 GeV.

Wait, but none of the options are near 14.4.

But wait, the options are all around 20 GeV. So what's wrong here?

Ah! Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the mass of the nucleus. Let me double-check.

Wait, Li-6 has Z=3, so 3 protons, and 3 neutrons. So 6 nucleons.

The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c² =0.938 GeV/c².

Neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c² =0.939565 GeV/c².

So 3 protons: 3 *0.938 =2.814 GeV.

3 neutrons: 3 *0.939565 =2.818695 GeV.

Total mass without binding energy: 2.814 +2.818695 =5.632695 GeV.

But considering binding energy, the actual mass is less. So the rest mass energy is m0c² = (sum of individual masses - binding energy).

But I don't know the exact binding energy for Li-6. So perhaps the problem expects me to ignore binding energy and simply sum the masses? Because that would give a higher value.

Wait, earlier, without considering binding energy, the rest mass would be 5.6327 GeV. But when binding energy is considered, the actual rest mass is less. But in the initial approach, I used a lower mass (5.589 GeV), which led to a lower KE. But the answer options suggest a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a deuterium or something else, but no, the question specifically says Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula, which includes gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, but that would be the total energy, not just kinetic. So E_total = gamma * m0c².

Wait, the problem says, what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. Typically, in colliders, the energy per beam is the kinetic energy, so each ion has KE, and they collide head-on, so the total is 2 KE. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy (gamma * m0c²) instead of just the kinetic energy. Let me see.

If E_total = gamma * m0c², then with gamma 3.5714 and m0c² 5.6327 GeV (sum of protons and neutrons without binding), then E_total is 3.5714 *5.6327 ≈ let's compute that.

3 *5.6327 =16.8981.

0.5714 *5.6327 ≈ let's see, 0.5*5.6327=2.81635, 0.0714 *5.6327≈0.4035. So total 3.2198.

So total E is 16.8981 +3.2198 ≈20.1179 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Hmm.

Alternatively, using the approximate m0c² as 5.6 GeV, the total energy would be 3.5714 *5.6 ≈ 20.0 GeV.

So that would point to option C: 20.132 GeV. Alternatively, option D is 21.419, which is higher.

Wait, but that's if I'm calculating the total energy. But the question asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. I thought it was kinetic energy, but perhaps it's the total energy.

Wait, the formula for the energy of the particle is E = gamma m0c², which includes rest mass and kinetic energy. So if the question is about the total energy, then it's 3.5714 * m0c².

So if m0c² is 5.6327 GeV, then 3.5714 *5.6327 ≈20.117 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). So that's likely the correct answer.

But why did I get 14.4 GeV for kinetic energy? Because E_kinetic = E_total - m0c² = (gamma -1) m0c².

So (3.5714 -1) *5.6327 = 2.5714 *5.6327 ≈14.4 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have 14.4. So perhaps the question is looking for the total energy, not the kinetic. Because then it's around 20 GeV, which matches option C.

Wait, but when I did the initial calculation without considering binding, I got E_total as 20.117 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132). So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the proton and neutron masses as m0c², not considering binding energy.

So, that leads me to choose option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the more precise value of the rest mass. The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0105 atomic mass units. One atomic mass unit is 0.931494 GeV/c². So 6.0105 * 0.931494 = let's compute that.

6 *0.931494 =5.588964 GeV.

0.0105 *0.931494 =0.009780 GeV.

Total m0c² is 5.588964 +0.009780 =5.598744 GeV.

So m0c²=5.5987 GeV.

Then E_total = gamma * m0c² =3.5714 *5.5987.

Compute that: 3 *5.5987 =16.7961.

0.5714 *5.5987 ≈ let's compute 0.5 *5.5987 =2.79935, 0.0714 *5.5987 ≈0.4001.

Total: 2.79935 +0.4001 =3.19945.

Total E:16.7961 +3.19945=20. (16.7961 +3.19945=20. 16.7961+3 is 19.7961, plus 0.19945 is 19.99555 GeV, approximately 20 GeV.)

So more accurately, 3.5714 *5.598744 ≈20 GeV.

Looking at option C: 20.132 GeV. That's very close.

Wait, let me compute more precisely.

3.5714 *5.5987:

Break it down as (3 +0.5 +0.0714) *5.5987.

3 *5.5987=16.7961.

0.5
