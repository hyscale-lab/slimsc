Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. We are provided with the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

The options give various forms of the normalized eigenvector elements. So my task is to find out which option correctly represents the eigenvector.

First, I remember that a quantum mechanical operator can be represented as a vector in space, and when we talk about the eigenvalue problem along a specific direction, it's related to the component of the operator along that direction. So the operator P can be written in terms of its components: P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but looking at the problem, each component is given as a matrix already multiplied by ħ/2. So for example, P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is exactly the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix, and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix. So the operator P is a combination of these, but wait, actually, each component is given as (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrix. So the operator is P = (ħ/2)(σ_x X_hat + σ_y Y_hat + σ_z Z_hat), where X_hat, Y_hat, Z_hat are the components of the direction vector n.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the Y-component of n is zero. So the operator P is given by P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Because the Y-component of the direction vector is zero, so Y_hat is zero, so the P_y term is zero.

Wait, but the problem states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So perhaps the operator is P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), but since n is in the x-z plane, n_y=0. So P becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is along a specific direction, so P might be expressed as the sum of each component multiplied by the unit vector in direction n. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so each component is given (Px, Py, Pz), and the operator along direction n is P · n, which would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, in the problem statement, the operator P is along the arbitrary direction n. So maybe the operator we're considering is P ⋅ n, which is the component along n.

But wait, the question says "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So perhaps the operator we are considering is the component of P along n. So the operator is (P ⋅ n), and we're looking for its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator itself is P, but the question is about the operator being applied along direction n. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I should proceed by considering that the operator in the direction n is P_n = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y =0, so P_n =n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Since the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, n_x and n_z can be represented in terms of an angle θ, say. For example, we can write n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, because in the x-z plane, the direction can be parameterized by θ from the x-axis.

So, the operator along direction n is P_n = (ħ/2)( cosθ σ_x + sinθ σ_z ), because P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, and P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z.

Wait, no. Wait, the components P_x, P_y, P_z as given are each (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective Pauli matrices. So P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, P_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. Therefore, P_n = (n_x (ħ/2 σ_x) ) + (n_z (ħ/2 σ_z) )) = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

But since n is a unit vector, sqrt(n_x² + n_z²) =1, so n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ perhaps, but that depends on how you parameterize. So P_n = (ħ/2)(cosθ σ_x + sinθ σ_z).

Wait, but I'm trying to find the eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, substituting P_n, we have (ħ/2)(cosθ σ_x + sinθ σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2)(+1) |ψ>.

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

(cosθ σ_x + sinθ σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, (cosθ σ_x + sinθ σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Let me write this as (σ · v) |ψ> = |ψ>, where v is (cosθ, 0, sinθ).

Wait, because σ · v is σ_x cosθ + σ_z sinθ.

The eigenvalue equation is (σ · v) |ψ> = λ |ψ>, where λ is an eigenvalue. The possible λ's for Pauli matrices are ±1 because (σ · v) squared is (v·v) I = I, so (σ · v)^2 = I, so eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, in our case, the equation is (σ · v) |ψ> = |ψ>, so the eigenvalue λ is 1. So, the eigenvector corresponds to λ=1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the equation correctly.

Wait, the operator is P_n = (ħ/2)(σ · n), so P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2)(σ · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) λ |ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue of σ · n, which can be ±1. So when we're given that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, that corresponds to λ = +1.

So, the eigenvalue equation is (σ · n) |ψ> = (1) |ψ>.

So, the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of σ · n with eigenvalue +1.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The matrix σ · n is n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Since our n is in the x-z plane, n_y =0, so σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z.

So, the matrix for σ · n is [n_z, n_x; n_x, -n_z]. Because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so n_x σ_x is [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]], and n_z σ_z is [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z]]. Summing these gives [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]].

So, the matrix is:

[ n_z, n_x ]
[ n_x, -n_z ]

We can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

The characteristic equation is det(σ·n - λ I) = 0.

So, determinant of [[n_z - λ, n_x ], [n_x, -n_z - λ]] = 0.

Which is (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) - n_x² = 0.

Expanding: ( -n_z^2 - λ n_z + λ n_z + λ² ) - n_x² = λ² - (n_z² + n_x²) = 0.

Since n_x² + n_z² =1 (because it's a unit vector), the equation becomes λ² -1 =0 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to λ=+1.

So, the eigenvector equation is (σ·n - I) |ψ> =0.

Which is:

[ n_z -1,   n_x     ] [a]   [0]
[   n_x,  -n_z -1 ] [b] = [0]

So, the two equations are:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b =0

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0

Let me write the first equation: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar, we can set b=1, then a= [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ].

Wait, but let me check. Let me solve the system:

From the first equation: (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Similarly, from the second equation: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0. Substituting a from the first into the second:

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b =0.

Factor out b:

[ (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) ] =0.

Multiply through by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) )=0.

Wait, let me expand the term (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = (-n_z)(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1) )= (-n_z² +n_z) -n_z +1 )= (-n_z² + n_z -n_z +1 )= (-n_z² +1 )

So, putting it all together:

- n_x^2 + (-n_z² +1 )=0 → -(n_x^2 +n_z^2) +1 =0 → -1 +1=0 → 0=0.

Which holds true, so the two equations are consistent, and the eigenvector can be expressed as a multiple of [ -n_x, (n_z -1) ]^T.

Wait, because from a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b → a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] * b.

So, if we let b = (n_z -1), then a = -n_x.

So, the eigenvector would be [a, b]^T = [ -n_x, (n_z -1) ]^T.

Alternatively, since eigenvectors can be scaled, the general form is k [ -n_x, n_z -1 ]^T, where k is a normalization constant.

But let me check that. Let me take the components a and b as a = -n_x, b = n_z -1.

Wait, let me compute the vector: ( -n_x, n_z -1 )

But wait, another approach is to express the eigenvector in terms of spherical coordinates. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, we can parameterize it by an angle θ from the x-axis, so n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

So substituting, the eigenvector becomes ( -cosθ, sinθ -1 )

Wait, but this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to express the eigenvector in terms of spin-1/2 states.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of S·n, where S is the spin operator, are |+> and |->, which correspond to spin-up and spin-down along direction n.

The spin-up state |+> along n is given by:

|+> = e^{-i φ/2} [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle. But since our direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is zero. So the state simplifies to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but that's for the spin-1/2 system along direction n in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, right?

Wait, but let me think again. The eigenstate for σ·n with eigenvalue +1 is proportional to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. Wait, is that correct?

Alternatively, perhaps it's [ sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ]^T. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me double-check.

The general formula for the eigenvectors of σ·n is:

For +1 eigenvalue: [ cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ]

For -1 eigenvalue: [ -i sin(θ/2), e^{i φ} cos(θ/2) ]

Since in our case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, φ=0. So the eigenvector for +1 becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, that makes sense. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, right?

Because when n is along the x-axis (θ=0), the eigenvector is [1,0]^T, which is correct. When n is along the z-axis (θ=90 degrees), it becomes [0,1]^T, which is correct as well.

So the components of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Now, looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I just derived.

But wait, option C is presented as "(\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))" which seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar and some sin(theta/2), but I don't see where that would come from.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in ignoring the ħ/2 factor. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator P is given as (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). So the eigenvector equation is:

(ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) (+1) |ψ>

So the equation simplifies to (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>

Which is the same as (σ·n) |ψ> = |ψ>, so the eigenvalue λ is 1.

So the eigenvector is the same as that of the Pauli matrix σ·n. So the eigenvector is indeed [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, assuming φ=0.

So the correct option is C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: (\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))

So the answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $Y$-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero, and the operator along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} (n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z),
\]

where $n_x = \cos\theta$ and $n_z = \sin\theta$ parameterize the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue equation for $P_n$ is:

\[
P_n | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
(n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z) | \psi \rangle = | \psi \rangle.
\]

This corresponds to finding the eigenvector of the matrix $\sigma \cdot \hat{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z$ with eigenvalue $+1$. The eigenstates of $\sigma \cdot \hat{n}$ are well-known in quantum mechanics and are given by:

\[
|+\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix}, \quad |-\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -i \sin(\theta/2) \\ \cos(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix}.
\]

For the eigenvalue $+1$, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|+\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix}.
\]

This matches the components given in **Option C**. The other options are either inconsistent with the derived eigenvector or introduce unnecessary factors (e.g., $\sqrt{2/3}\hbar$ and $\sqrt{1/3}\hbar$ in Option D), which are not supported by the problem setup.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
