Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium quite strongly. 

The given data: the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The K for the complex, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. And the pH is ideal, which I think probably means that the EDTA is in its correct deprotonated form to complex with Ca²+.

Wait, so the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The Ca-EDTA forms when Ca²+ binds with EDTA^4- (if I remember right). So the complex dissociates as Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The K here is the formation constant, but wait, sometimes K is given as the formation constant, which is the reverse of the dissociation. Oh wait, K for the complex is usually the formation constant, Kf. So Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[Ca-EDTA].

Wait, but in this problem, K_Ca-EDTA is given as 5e10, which I think is the formation constant, Kf. So that equation would be Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA].

But in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA] as 0.02 M. We can assume that the complex dissociates to a small extent, so the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be equal and let's call that x. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x. But since K is so large (5e10), which is a very strong complex, the dissociation is negligible. So x would be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02.

So plugging into the Kf equation: 5e10 = (x)(x) / 0.02. So x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x is sqrt(1e9) which is 3.16e4 M? Wait wait that can't be right. Wait wait, because 0.02 M is the concentration of the complex. If K is 5e10, which is a huge number, meaning the complex is very stable, so very little dissociates. So x is the concentration of Ca²+.

Wait, but if K is 5e10, and assuming [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, then x² = K * [CaEDTA] = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x is sqrt(1e9) = approx 3e4 M. Wait, but 3e4 M is way higher than the concentration of the complex. That can't be possible. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait, the K is given as K_Ca-EDTA. I think I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check. The formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or similar charge, but the exact charge might not matter here). So Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, if that's the case, then Kf = 5e10. So the equation becomes 5e10 = [CaEDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). Assuming that the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA, and that the dissociation is negligible, so [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02.

So 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2) → x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x^2 = 4e-12 → x = sqrt(4e-12) = 2e-6 M. Wait, that's 2e-6 M. But looking at the options, none of them are 2e-6. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I got the K expression wrong. Let me think again. If K_Ca-EDTA is the dissociation constant, Kd instead of Kf. Oh, that's possible. Because sometimes K is given as the dissociation constant. So if Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA]/[CaEDTA], then the problem changes.

Wait, the question says KCa-EDTA is 5e10. I'm a bit confused about whether K is the formation or dissociation constant. In chemistry, Kf is formation (forward reaction), and Kd is dissociation (reverse reaction). So if the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10, that's probably the formation constant. So Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So the equation is [CaEDTA] = Kf * [Ca²+][EDTA^4-].

Assuming that the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA, and that the concentration of free Ca²+ is x, and free EDTA is y, but if the solution is at stoichiometric point, perhaps y is x. Wait, no, because the complex is formed 1:1, so [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.

So substituting: 0.02 = Kf * x^2 → x^2 = 0.02 / 5e10 → x^2 = 4e-12 → x = 2e-6 M. But that's 2e-6, which is 2.0e-6 M. But the options given are up to 1e-2 M. Hmm, the options don't have that. Let's look at the options again.

Options:
A) 2.0x10^-2 M 
B)5.0x10^-3 
C)6.3x10^-7 
D)1.0x10^-2 

Wait, none of these match 2e-6. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the K is given as the dissociation constant, Kd.

So let's try that. Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA] = 5e10. Then, if the concentration of CaEDTA is 0.02 M, and assuming [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, then:

Kd = x² / 0.02 = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 *5e10 → x²=1e9 → x= 3.16e4 M. That's impossible, as it's higher than the concentration of the complex. Which can't be right.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So maybe I have the K direction wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is [Ca²+] = K * [CaEDTA]. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, another approach. The total concentration of EDTA in solution would be the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex.

Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the total EDTA is 0.02 M, assuming 1:1 ratio. So [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. The rest is free Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, perhaps I should write the expression correctly. Let me define Kf as the formation constant:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So, Kf = 5e10.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA] = y.

Assuming that the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA, and assuming that the amount of free Ca²+ and EDTA is x and y, respectively.

But in a 1:1 complex, the total EDTA is [EDTA] = y + [CaEDTA] = y + 0.02. But if the solution is such that the EDTA is in the form that is deprotonated (which the pH is ideal), then perhaps the free EDTA is y = [EDTA^4-].

Wait, but the problem says pH is ideal, so maybe all the EDTA is in the EDTA^4- form. So [EDTA] = y = [EDTA^4-]. 

But the total EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex and the initial EDTA added. Wait, no, the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial EDTA is all in the complex, but when it dissociates, it releases EDTA^4-.

Wait, but if we have 0.02 M CaEDTA, and it dissociates a little, then the free EDTA is y, and free Ca²+ is x. So:

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is large, x is small).

[Ca²+] = x.

[EDTA^4-] = y. But since the complex dissociates into EDTA^4-, the total EDTA (from complex) is y = x.

Wait, no. Wait, each mole of complex that dissociates produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So if x is the amount dissociated, then [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into Kf:

Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10.

So 0.02/(x^2) =5e10 → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → x^2 = 4e-12 → x = 2e-6 M.

So [Ca²+] is 2e-6 M, which is 2.0e-6 M. But that's not one of the options. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which is about a third of 2e-6. So maybe I made a miscalculation. Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2) / (5e10) = 4e-13. Taking the square root gives 2e-6.5? Wait wait, no:

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Then, x is the square root of 4e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-12 is 1e-6. So 2e-6? Wait, no, that's sqrt(4e-12) is 2e-6. Hmm.

So [Ca²+] is 2e-6 M. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the Kd is given instead of Kf. Let me check that scenario.

If Kd is the dissociation constant: Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA]/[CaEDTA] =5e10.

Then, 5e10 = x^2 / 0.02 → x^2 = 0.02 *5e10=1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M. That's impossible because it's way larger than the concentration of the complex. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I got the K expression wrong. Alternatively, maybe the complex is in a different stoichiometry, but the question says it's stoichiometric, so 1:1.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the K is given as the inverse, so the K is 1/Kf. So if K=5e10 is actually Kd, which is 1/Kf. Wait, but that would make Kd = 2e-11, which seems more reasonable.

Wait, let me think again. If K is the dissociation constant, Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA]/[CaEDTA] = 5e10.

Then, as earlier, x^2 =5e10 *0.02 =1e9 → x≈3e4 M. Impossible.

Wait, perhaps the K given is the stability constant, which is the same as Kf. So going back, the correct expression is Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]).

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2) → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, no, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, so 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2. So x=2e-6.5= approx 3.16e-7 M. Wait, that's 3.16e-7 M. None of the options match either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recalculate:

0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7.

Wait, that's approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, so earlier I thought x was 2e-6, but I must have miscalculated the exponent. Because 0.02 is 2e-2, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13, whose square root is 2e-6.5 which is approximately 6.3e-7. Oh, I see, so I messed up the exponents earlier. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f \), which is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of free calcium ions and free EDTA ions be \( x \). Since the complex dissociates minimally due to the large \( K_f \), we approximate \([\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**
