Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. When we titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, it will neutralize the acid to form acetate ions and water.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

The formula for dilution is C1V1 = C2V2. So the initial concentration (C1) is 0.05 M, and the volume (V1) is 20 cm³. The new volume (V2) is 40 cm³. So the new concentration (C2) would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = concentration * volume (in liters). So, 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. 

To reach equivalence, moles of NaOH should be 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, the question is about pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let me tackle each part.

Starting with 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. 

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na⁺ + H2O.

So, initially, after dilution, the solution has 0.025 M CH3COOH. Let's find the concentrations after adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

First, the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH, the moles of CH3COOH left will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of CH3COO⁻ (acetate) formed will be 0.00025 moles.

The total volume now is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH added) = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This looks like a buffer solution, where a weak acid and its conjugate base are present. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is approximately 4.733 (since 1e-5 has a log of 5, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733).

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 1.85e-5 is the Ka. Taking the log: log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so log(Ka)= -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:
pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)
Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. Hmm, so about 4.26.

Looking at the options, the first number in option A is 4.26. But let me see the other parts.

Now for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will consist of Na+ and CH3COO⁻. But since Na+ is a spectator ion, the pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

The moles of acetate at equivalence are 0.001 moles, in a total volume of 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:
CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression. Let x be the [OH⁻] produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x² = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11. Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29e-6 M. pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.485. Therefore, pH = 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515, approximately 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. But another option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait another thought: At equivalence, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid. So the solution should be basic, which makes sense why pH is above 7. So the pH at equivalence should be around 8.52, as I calculated.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26;8.52. That matches my calculations. But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 4.26;8.52

B) 3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

So if the calculation is correct, option A is the answer. But let me double-check the equivalence point part.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is not just acetate ions, but also the dilution effect. Let me recheck the moles and concentrations.

At equivalence, moles of acetic acid are 0.001, which are converted to acetate. The volume is 40+10=50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M acetate. Correct.

Then Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction: CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO⁻]

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration (0.02), so:

x² = 0.02 * Kb = 0.02 *5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.485, so pH = 14-5.485=8.515. So about 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52.

So the first part (25% titration) pH is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So the correct option is A.

But wait, looking at the initial calculations, wait another thing. When we dilute the acetic acid, I might have made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Correct.

After adding 20 cm³ water, volume is 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 /0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

At 25% titration, 25% of 10 cm³ (equivalence volume) is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Moles NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025. So moles acid = 0.00075, moles acetate = 0.00025. Correct.

So in the buffer solution, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) = 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So that part is correct.

So the options don't have any other option that matches 4.26 and 8.52 except A. So the answer should be A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( C_1V_1 = C_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
C_2 = \frac{C_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the pH at 25% titration. At this point, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume is now \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)). The total volume is \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L} \). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) produced. The expression for \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.0200}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.0200) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
