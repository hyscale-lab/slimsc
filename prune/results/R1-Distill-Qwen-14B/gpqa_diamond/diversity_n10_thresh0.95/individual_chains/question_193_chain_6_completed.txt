Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, that's a bit unusual because I remember that the number of stars usually depends on distance in a way related to parallax, but let me think.

Wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So like, if something is farther away, its parallax is smaller. So plx = 1/distance, right? Or was it plx = 1/(distance in parsecs)? Yeah, I think that's correct. So plx is inversely proportional to the distance r. So, plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs maybe.

The question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that.

1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as r^5. Wait, no, wait: (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Does that mean the number of stars increases with r^5? But wait, I thought that as you go further away, you'd see fewer stars because they're spread out more. So maybe I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is a constant. And since plx = 1/r, substituting, N = k * r^5. So if r increases, N would increase as the fifth power. But that's counterintuitive, because when you go further, shouldn't the number of stars decrease? Because each star is dimmer and farther apart.

Wait, maybe the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit distance. Like, if you have a small range in distance, how does the number of stars in that range change with r? Because the total number up to a certain distance might be increasing, but the number in a thin shell could be different.

But let's think again. The question is, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's the number per unit volume, but I'm not entirely sure.

In astronomy, when you're counting stars, the number you can see depends on the volume. The volume of a spherical shell (like a thin layer at distance r) is 4πr² dr, where dr is the thickness. So the number of stars in a thin shell would be proportional to r² times dr, assuming that the density of stars is uniform. But wait, in this question, the number isn't proportional to r², but to something else.

Wait, but wait. Let's go back to the given relation. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So, for a given region, if the number of stars is proportional to r^5, that would mean that as you go further away, you count more stars in that region. That doesn't make sense, because in reality, the further away you go, the stars are less dense because they're spread out, so you'd expect fewer stars in a given volume. Hmm, maybe the given relation is not about a volume but something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering how the number of stars is being observed. Like, maybe it's about the apparent brightness or something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars is measured in a specific area of the sky, and they are looking at how the count changes with distance. Let me think: the number of stars in a region of the sky depends on the density of stars along the line of sight. So, for a fixed area, the number of stars you can see depends on how much volume you can see into. The volume at distance r is roughly proportional to r² dr (since the volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr). So the number of stars would be the density multiplied by that volume.

But in this problem, the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5) = k r^5. So, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So if you look at a region of the sky, and your method for counting stars is such that N ∝ r^5, then as you go to a larger r, you'll see more stars. But why would that be? Could it be that in this region, the density of stars increases with distance? That would be unusual because typically, stars are more concentrated in the galactic plane, but that's a different consideration.

Wait, perhaps the relationship given is not about the actual count but about the observed count, which might include factors like brightness. Oh, because stars further away are dimmer, so you can only see brighter stars, which might be fewer. But then the relation would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the number of stars is being measured is considering something else, like their apparent brightness, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the astronomer is using a specific method to count the stars, and the number as a function of parallax is given. So in any case, the number of stars N is proportional to r^5. So when r increases, the number of stars per unit distance (or per unit dr) would be dN/dr = 5 r^4. Wait, but that's when N is proportional to r^5. So dN/dr = 5 r^4, which suggests that the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. But none of the options say r^4. Wait, the options are A: r^3, B: r^5, C: r^4, D: r^2. So option C is r^4.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr is dN = (dN/dr) dr. So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the number per unit distance (dN) is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, let me think again. Because N as a function of r is given as N = k r^5. So per unit distance, the number is dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like in a slice dr thick) increases as r^4. So the answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

But wait, I thought the number of stars you can see in a region of the sky would decrease with distance because it's harder to see them. But according to the given relation, N is proportional to r^5, so the number increases. That suggests that in this specific situation, the number of stars observed increases with distance, which is counterintuitive. Maybe the question is not about the actual number of stars, but some other measure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars that lie within a certain distance range. So maybe the total number up to a distance r is N = k r^5. Then the number of stars per unit distance (as in, the number in a shell dr thick) would be dN/dr = 5k r^4, which is option C. So that's the reasoning.

So looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be C.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the given relation yields \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars in the region increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To find this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which gives the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness \( dr \) at distance \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

This result aligns with the given relation \( N \propto r^5 \), where the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( r \) grows as \( r^4 \). Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
