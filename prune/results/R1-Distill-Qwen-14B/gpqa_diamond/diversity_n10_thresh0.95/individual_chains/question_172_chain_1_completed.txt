Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. So I should probably use the Boltzmann equation for population distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - delta_E / (k*T) ), where delta_E is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, the question says the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So for star_1, the ratio n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 is twice that of star_2's n_upper_2 / n_lower_2. Let me write that down.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Assuming that the statistical weights (g_upper and g_lower) are the same for both stars because they're the same element (iron) and same energy levels. So g_upper / g_lower is a constant for both stars. Let me call that constant 'g'.

So R1 = g * exp(-delta_E/(k*T1))
And R2 = g * exp(-delta_E/(k*T2))

Since R1 is twice R2, I can write: g exp(-delta_E/(k T1)) = 2 * g exp(-delta_E/(k T2))

The 'g's cancel out. So exp(-delta_E/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-delta_E/(k T2))

Hmm, I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this.

Taking ln on both sides: (-delta_E/(k T1)) = ln(2) + (-delta_E/(k T2))

Let me rearrange that equation. Let's move terms around.

(-delta_E/(k T1)) + (delta_E/(k T2)) = ln(2)

Factor out delta_E/(k):

delta_E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, delta_E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me think about the value of k, Boltzmann constant. It's about 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta_E is equal to k*Boltzmann? Wait, delta_E is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the same as k (since k is ~1.38e-23 J/K). So delta_E = k.

So substituting delta_E = k into the equation:

k/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

The k's cancel out, so:

1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = ln(2)

Hmm, let me rearrange this.

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2)

Wait, but I'm looking for an equation relating T1 and T2. Let me express this as:

(1/T2) = (1/T1) + ln(2)

Wait, but I'm being asked to find an equation in terms of T1 and T2. Let me try to manipulate the equation.

Let me write 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Which can be rewritten as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, wait. Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yeah, that's the same as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So rearranged, that would be ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). 

Wait, looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that would be the correct equation.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the steps. Because in my derivation, I ended up with 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2), which became (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2). So yes, that's correct.

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's option D.

Let me look at the options again.

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1 → No, doesn't match.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) → No, because I have T1-T2 in the numerator.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2 → The denominator has square, which I don't have.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) → Yes, matches.

So the correct answer should be option D.


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation for population distribution applies.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population ratio of two energy levels to temperature as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are related by \( R_1 = 2R_2 \), where \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are the ratios of upper to lower populations for star_1 and star_2, respectively. Assuming \( g_{\text{upper}} / g_{\text{lower}} \) is constant for both stars, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \) (given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting this in terms of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A (\( \ln(2) = T_2 / T_1 \)) does not match the derived relationship.
- Option B (\( \ln(2) = (T_1 + T_2) / (T_1 T_2) \)) introduces an incorrect additive term in the numerator.
- Option C (\( \ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 T_2)^2 \)) incorrectly squares the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
