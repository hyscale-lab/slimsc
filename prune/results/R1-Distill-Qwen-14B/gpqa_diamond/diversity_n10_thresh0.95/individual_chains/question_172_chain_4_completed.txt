Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with stars and their atmospheres, the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) comes into play. LTE means that the gas in the photosphere is emitting and absorbing radiation as if it were in equilibrium, so the usual laws like the Boltzmann distribution apply.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find out which equation relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2 correctly.

Wait, I remember the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of energy levels in a gas. The formula is something like the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor. The equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Oh right, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, star_1 has twice the excitation in a specific level compared to star_2. Let's say the excited state is level i and the lower state is level j. So for star 1, n_i1 / n_j1 is twice star 2's n_i2 / n_j2. But wait, wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher, or perhaps it's the number of atoms in that specific energy level.

Wait, no. The problem says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level" compared to star_2. So perhaps the population of that energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let me think: Let's denote that the excitation level is given by the number of atoms in that state. So n1 is the number in star_1, and n2 in star_2.

Wait, but how do the temperatures relate? The ratio of excited to lower state is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me write that down.

For each star, the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference (E_i - E_j). But wait, wait, if E_i is higher than E_j, then the ratio would be less than one because exponent is negative. So higher energy levels have fewer atoms.

Wait, but in the question, the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J.

So, for star 1 and star 2, the ratio of excitation (n_i/n_j) would be:

For star_1: (n_i1)/(n_j1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (n_i2)/(n_j2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in this specific energy level. So I think this means that the ratio n_i1/n_j1 is twice n_i2/n_j2. So:

(n_i1/n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2)

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Let me rearrange this:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

But wait, let's compute that step by step. Let's see:

Left side: ln( (n_i1/n_j1)/(n_i2/n_j2) ) = ln(2)

Which comes from n_i1/n_j1 = 2 (n_i2/n_j2)

So ln( (n_i1/n_j1)/(n_i2/n_j2) ) = ln(2)

Which is ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ln(2)

Simplifying the inside: exp( ( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) )

So that's exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2

Taking ln on both sides: ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but that would be:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

But wait, let me double-check the signs.

Wait, the left side after taking logs was:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

So, ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but the question is about the equation relating T1 and T2. So the equation we have is:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE /k) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / ( T1 T2 )

But wait, let's think about the given options.

The options are all in the form ln(2) = something involving T1 and T2.

Wait, let's compute ΔE/(k). The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. And the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same number!

So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE / k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So substituting back, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [ (1 K) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

So that can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the correct equation is option D.

Wait, let me double-check. The equation I derived was:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Since ΔE/(k)=1, so yes, ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the excitation of a specific energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, and the energy difference between the levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population ratio of two energy levels to the temperature of the system:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excitation are:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

The term \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) can be rewritten as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), so:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The Boltzmann constant \(k\) is approximately \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), and the energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1\). Substituting this:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
