Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), and S has the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, first, I need to figure out what A_y actually is. Since c is h/(4π), multiplying the matrix S by that.

Wait, matrix multiplication: each element of S is multiplied by c. So A_y would be [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]. That's the matrix form of A_y.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to solve the eigenvalue equation A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue.

Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0. Let me write down A_y:

A_y = [ [ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
         [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

So the matrix is [[0, a], [a*, 0]], where a is (-i h)/(4π), and a* is its complex conjugate, which would be (i h)/(4π). Wait, no, a is actually the element (1,2), which is (-i h)/(4π). So the matrix looks like:

| 0        (-i h)/(4π) |
| (i h)/(4π) 0         |

So the trace is zero, and the determinant is (0)(0) - [(-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π))] = [(-i)(i) (h^2)/(16 π²) )]. Let's compute that: (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So determinant is (h²)/(16 π²).

Wait, the characteristic equation is λ² - (trace) λ + determinant = 0. Since trace is zero, equation is λ² + (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. Because the determinant is (h^2)/(16 π²) from above.

Wait, so λ² = - (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± i (h)/(4 π).

Ah, so the eigenvalues a are ± (i h)/(4 π). Wait, but the options given in the choices don't seem to match this. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh and real part ±h/(4π). Hmm, but my eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is ±h/(4π). That doesn't fit option A.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Doesn't fit either, because the eigenvalues I found have imaginary parts h/(4π) and real part zero.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the determinant. Let me double-check. The matrix is:

[0, a]
[a*, 0]

Where a is (-i h)/(4π). The determinant is (0)(0) - (a)(a^*) = - |a|^2. Because a is complex, a times a^* is |a|^2.

So |a|^2 is [ (h/(4π))^2 * (i)(-i) ]? Wait, no, a is (-i h)/(4π), so a^* is (i h)/(4π). So a*a^* would be [ (-i)(i) ]*(h²)/(16 π²). (-i)(i) is -i² = 1. So |a|^2 is (h²)/(16 π²).

So determinant is - (h²)/(16 π²). So the equation is λ² - trace λ + determinant = 0 → λ² + (h²)/(16 π²) = 0, same as before. So λ = ± i (h)/(4 π). 

Thus, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the eigenvalues have zero real parts and imaginary parts ±h/(4π).

Looking back at the options:

Option B: eigenvalues have real parts ±1 and imaginary ±1/2. Doesn't match.

Option D: eigenfunctions are basis functions of Ay. Hmm, but the basis functions are the eigenvectors, so any eigenvector is part of the basis. But I'm not sure if that's the correct statement.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Wait, but for angular momentum operators, [A², A_y] =0, so eigenstates of A_y are also eigenstates of A². So in that case, C is incorrect because they can be eigenfunctions of A². But it says the opposite. So C is incorrect.

Alternatively, if the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z, that's correct because [A_y, A_z] = iħ A_x, so they don't commute. So their eigenstates don't share the same set of eigenvectors. But the first part of option C is correct regarding A².

So option C is incorrect because it says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2, which is true, but the second part says they can't be eigenfunctions of Az, which is also correct. So the option says 'can also be' but it's actually correct that they can be. Hmm, now I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is about the statements made during the calculation. So the correct statement during calculation would be about the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Looking back, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, a = ± i (h)/(4 π).

So the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is ±(h/(4 π)). So looking at the options again:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form the basis for the space, which is 2-dimensional. So any operator's eigenvectors, when they're a complete set, form a basis. So D might be correct.

Wait, but the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's see the options again.

Option D is a statement about the nature of the eigenfunctions. So if I'm solving the eigenvalue equation, I would represent the eigenvectors as basis vectors. So during calculation, I might consider that the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator, which is correct because the operator is 2x2 and has two eigenvectors (assuming they're not degenerate, which they aren't here as eigenvalues are distinct). So D's statement is correct.

Looking back, what about the other options:

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ± 0.5, real ±1. No, not correct.

Option A: imaginary parts are ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). No, because in my calculation, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with imaginary parts ±h/(4π). So none of the options A or B match.

So the only correct options are D and perhaps C, but I'm not certain about C.

Wait, let's go back to the problem statement. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So the first part is correct, but the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct because [Ay, Az] = i ħ Ax, so they don't share eigenstates. So the statement in C is correct.

Wait, but the options are whether the statements are correct during calculation. So which statements are correct?

In the calculation, when finding Ay's eigenvalues and eigenvectors, one might note that the eigenvectors are the basis functions for Ay. So option D says that, which would be correct.

Alternatively, option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² and Ay commute, so their eigenstates are the same, but Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenstates are different. So option C is correct.

But the problem is, which of the options is correct during the calculation. So the person is trying to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So which statement would they make during that calculation.

Wait, perhaps during the calculation, the person would note that the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator, which would be D.

Alternatively, when they find the eigenvalues, they realize the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so none of the options A or B are correct. So perhaps the correct statement is D.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. What's each option.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, any 2x2 matrix has a basis of eigenvectors (if diagonalizable). Since the eigenvalues are distinct (± i h/(4π)), the matrix is diagonalizable, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

So the correct answer is option D?


The problem involves analyzing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented as a 2×2 matrix. The operator is given by \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) has the matrix form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues \( a \) of \( A_y \), the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \) is solved. The trace of \( A_y \) is zero, and the determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y) = -\left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = -\left(\frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}\right).
\]

The characteristic equation is:

\[
\lambda^2 + \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0.
\]

Solving this gives the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda = \pm i \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

These eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with zero real parts and imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This eliminates options A and B, as their eigenvalues do not match the calculated results.

For option C, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute (\( [A_y, A_z] = i\hbar A_x \)). Thus, the statement in option C is correct.

For option D, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional space of the operator, as \( A_y \) is diagonalizable with two distinct eigenvalues. This statement is also correct.

Between options C and D, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. While both statements are valid, the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors inherently involves recognizing that the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator. Therefore, option D is the most relevant statement during the calculation.

Answer: D
