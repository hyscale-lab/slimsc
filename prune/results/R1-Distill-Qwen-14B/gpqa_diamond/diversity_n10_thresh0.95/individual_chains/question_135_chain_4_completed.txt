Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, okay, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in my particle physics class.

The question says that the bosonic field X interacts with fermions via a Lagrangian given. The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh right, I think this is a Yukawa-like interaction. So the boson X couples to fermions with a coupling strength λ. The term v is probably the vacuum expectation value (VEV), but maybe it doesn't matter here since the decays are about X coupling.

So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term is there. The question is which fermions can X decay into, considering their masses and the mass of X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that has a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV can be produced.

Wait, but wait, each fermion has a certain mass. So for a pair like f and f-bar, the total mass is 2m_f (since each has mass m_f). So 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let me list the known fermions and their masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV. Definitely, because 0.001 is way less than 3.
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV. Also less.
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV. That's under 3.
- Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s): all much lighter. Wait, but the current masses vary. Up and down are like a few MeV, strange is about 100 MeV. So their masses are way below 3 GeV.
- Charm (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV. Well, 1.2 is less than 3. So 2m_c is about 2.4 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar.
- Bottom (b): mass about 4.5-5 GeV. Wait, 4.5 GeV is more than 3. So 2m_b would be around 9 GeV, which is way above X's mass of 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar.
- Top quark (t): way heavier, like 173 GeV. So no way.

Wait wait, but the options have some with b b-bar and others without. Hmm. So if the X's mass is 6 GeV, and the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, then 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So any option that includes b b-bar is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b-bar. So not possible.

Option B: does not include b. But includes c, s, u, d, tau, e, and mu.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. Wait, but top quark is way too heavy. So option C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, which we determined is not allowed. So D is wrong.

Wait, so the correct decay products are those fermion pairs where each fermion's mass is ≤3 GeV. So let's go through each fermion:

- e: yes
- mu: yes
- tau: yes (1.78 GeV)
- u, d: yes (masses ~MeV, negligible)
- s: yes (mass around 100 MeV)
- c: yes (mass ~1.2 GeV)
- b: no (mass ~4.5 GeV)
- t: no.

So the possible decay channels are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but what about the charged leptons? The tau is a charged lepton, as are mu and e. So when X decays, it can produce any of these charged lepton pairs as well as quark-antiquark pairs.

So looking back at the options, option B includes all these except the b quark.

Wait, option B says X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the possible ones under 3 GeV per particle.

Option B's answer includes c, which is allowed. So option B is correct.

Wait wait, but what about the tau? Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is around 3.56 GeV. Wait, that's more than 3 GeV, but wait, X's mass is 6 GeV. Wait, 2m_tau would be about 3.56 GeV, so 3.56 <6. So yes, they can be produced.

Wait, wait, no. The tau mass is about 1.777 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.554 GeV. That's way less than 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau+ tau-.

So the allowed fermions are all the ones with m_f ≤3 GeV, including tau, but not including b.

So the possible decay products are: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Which matches option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on its interaction with fermions. The interaction is described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

where \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the total mass of the fermion pair \( 2m_f \) must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), which implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, only fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) can be produced in the decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \). This includes:
- \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( c \bar{c} \)

Fermions with \( m_f > 3 \, \text{GeV} \), such as the \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \) pairs, are excluded because their combined mass exceeds 6 GeV.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), corresponding to **Option B**.
