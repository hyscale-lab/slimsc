Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again and try to figure out what's going on. So, we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a certain region is related to the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that region. Oh wait, but wait—since the wave function is given, I think I should normalize it so that the total probability is 1. Because the probability of finding the particle somewhere has to be 100%, right?

So the wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. Let me think, ψ(x) is a complex function. The probability density is |ψ(x)|². So I need to calculate that.

Wait, but the problem says that when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 to x=3. So that means the wave function is zero or not present outside that region. Or wait, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero elsewhere. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, that might not be correct because if it's zero outside, that would mean the function is zero except between 1 and 3. But the given function is defined for all x where it can exist. Hmm, perhaps the wave function is defined only between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, the problem says "in a part of space where it can exist". So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, so maybe that's the part where it's non-zero.

Wait, but the part where it can exist is between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside that region. So the actual wave function is ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] -0.5i for 1≤x≤3 and zero otherwise. Or maybe that's the case. Hmm, but the problem says that when they measured the position, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be non-zero only in that region, implying that elsewhere it's zero.

So, to find 'a', I need to normalize the wave function. The integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 should be equal to 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². The wave function is ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i. So |ψ|² is ψ multiplied by ψ*, which would be [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2. Because when multiplying them, the cross terms (the ones with i and -i) would cancel out, perhaps.

Wait, let me do that calculation correctly. ψ = A - Bi, where A is a/sqrt(1+x) and B is 0.5. Then ψ* is A + Bi. So |ψ|² is (A)^2 + (B)^2.

So, |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1.

Wait, but wait, the integral of |ψ|² over all space is 1. But since ψ is zero outside 1 to 3, the integral is from 1 to3 of |ψ|² dx = 1.

So let me compute that integral.

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

Split that into two integrals: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3, plus 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to3.

Compute each part.

First integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3.

So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2= 0.5.

So the entire integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, which means a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check. Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. I assumed the wave function is zero outside x=1 to 3, but perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in that interval. So my approach should be correct.

Wait, but I should make sure. So the wave function is ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero elsewhere. So when I square the absolute value, it is (a²/(1 + x) ) + (0.5)^2, as I did before.

The integral from 1 to3 of that should be 1.

Another thing: sometimes wave functions may have an overall normalization factor. But in this case, the function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, so that's our ψ(x) in the region.

Wait, but wait—what if the wave function isn't zero outside, but just that the particles are found only between 1 and3? No, because the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. If it's zero elsewhere, then the particles are found only where ψ(x) is non-zero. So the given expression must be the ψ(x) only in the region 1 ≤ x ≤3. Elsewhere, ψ=0.

So my integral approach is correct.

So a ≈ sqrt( (0.5)/(ln(2)) ) ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈0.849, which is approximately 0.85, so option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is proportional to \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1
\]

1. Compute \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \):
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]

2. Compute \( \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx \):
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 3 - 1 = 2
   \]

Substituting these results back, the equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtract \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Take the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
