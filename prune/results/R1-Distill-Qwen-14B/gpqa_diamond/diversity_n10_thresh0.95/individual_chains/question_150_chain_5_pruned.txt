Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, let's look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

The 1H-NMR peaks are:
9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Hmm, the 9.72 ppm triplet is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde group attached to something else.

Looking at the other peaks: the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets suggest aromatic protons. Since they are doublets and each is 2H, maybe they are part of a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling would be with two equivalent protons across the ring.

The 6.27 ppm broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals can be due to exchange with protons, like OH groups. But wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe two aromatic protons, but maybe in a different environment. Alternatively, it could be a vinyl group, but the broadness makes me think of something else.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. That seems like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Or perhaps a methylene group next to a carbonyl. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring group, maybe another CH2 or something else.

Putting this together, let's think about possible structures. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's compute the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be two rings and one double bond, or one ring and three double bonds, etc. But given the NMR, probably two benzene rings (each contributes 4 degrees) but wait, no.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. Each benzene ring is three double bonds, contributing 4 degrees each (since each ring is 1, each double bond is 1). So a benzene ring is 4 degrees. So if there are two benzene rings, that's 8 degrees, but our total is 5. So that's not possible. Hmm, so maybe only one benzene ring.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's recalculate. The formula is C8H9NO. So 2*8 + 2 = 18; 18 -9 =9; 9 -1 (X is 0) + 1 (N)= 10. 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees.

One benzene ring is 4 degrees (3 double bonds, 1 ring). Let's say that. Then the remaining 1 degree could be a double bond or a ring. But looking at the NMR, the 3.66 ppm is a CH2 group perhaps adjacent to an oxygen, and the aldehyde. So perhaps the structure has a benzene ring, a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde), and some substituents.

Wait, maybe it's a phenyl group attached to a chain. Let's think about the peaks. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is likely the aldehyde proton. The aromatic protons at 6.98 and 6.51 could be part of a para-substituted benzene ring. So maybe the compound has a benzaldehyde group connected to something else.

Wait, but the 6.27 ppm singlet (2H) could be two protons on a vinyl group. Or perhaps they're adjacent to an oxygen, like in a dihydroxy group. Alternatively, maybe they're part of an aromatic ring that's not para-substituted, but other substitution patterns.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows an aldehyde (9.72), two doublets each integrating to 2H (so maybe a para-substituted benzene with two sets of substituents). The 3.66 ppm could be a -OCH2- group, perhaps part of a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. For example, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with an oxygen-containing group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with an attached ethyl group that's connected to an oxygen. Like, maybe something like Ph-CH2-O-R. But how does that tie together?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO. Let's see: its formula would be C9H8O. But our compound is C8H9NO, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is a di-substituted benzaldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reagents. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. Then H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat.

Wait, those reagents. NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization, especially with aromatic amines. Diazonium salt formation. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So maybe the compound has an aromatic amine group.

Wait, but wait, the NMR doesn't show any NH protons. Oh, but the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet, perhaps indicating deprotonated phenolic OH groups. Hmm, but the starting compound's molecular formula includes an O and an N, so perhaps it's an amino group, but in the NMR, the broad singlet could be for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is an aniline derivative with an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the compound is something like 4-aminophenyl acetaldehyde. Wait, that would have the formula C8H9NO: 4-aminobenzaldehyde is C7H7NO, but with an ethyl group attached? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought. The integration of 1H at 9.72 is for the aldehyde. The 3.66 ppm CH2 is perhaps a -CH2- group adjacent to an O, like an ether or ester. Maybe a structure like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that would be cinnamaldehyde, which doesn't fit the formula. Alternatively, maybe Ph-O-CH2-CHO? But that would be Ph-O-CH2-CHO.

Wait, let me calculate the molecular formula for that. Ph is C6H5. O is O. CH2 is CH2, CHO is CHO. So total would be C6 + 3 = C9, H5 (from benzene) + 2 (from CH2) + 1 (CHO) = H8, O2, N0. So our compound is C8H9NO, which doesn't match. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an aldehyde attached to a benzene ring which also has an oxygen-containing substituent, like an ether or an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitrobenzene derivative. But wait, the NMR doesn't show the nitro group's deshielded protons, but I'm not sure. Nitro groups typically have protons in the aromatic region, but in this case, the aromatic protons are at 6.98 and 6.51, which could be for a para-substituted ring.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. Imagine a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an aldehyde group (CHO), and the other is a CH2 group connected to something else. Wait, but the CH2 in the NMR is at 3.66 ppm, so maybe it's OCH2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is an aldehyde connected to a benzene ring, which also has an oxygen-containing substituent. Like, maybe benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an ethylene group or something.

Alternatively, let me think about the NMR signals again. The 9.72 ppm is an aldehyde. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each with 2H could be two sets of para-substituted groups on the benzene ring. For example, a benzene ring with substituents at para positions, each substituent having two protons that are coupled. So if the ring has two substituents, each with two protons, perhaps as part of another aromatic ring or some other group.

Wait, but the starting compound is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible functional groups. It has an aldehyde (CHO), and perhaps an amino group (NH2), but in the NMR, I don't see any NH peaks. Alternatively, maybe an oxygen-containing group, like an ether or an ester.

Another thought: perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene with an aldehyde group and
