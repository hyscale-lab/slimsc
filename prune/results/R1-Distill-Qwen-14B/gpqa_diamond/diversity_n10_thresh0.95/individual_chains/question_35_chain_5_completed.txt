Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y. The operator is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I'll need to model this matrix and figure out its eigenvalues.

Wait, wait. The eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. Right.

First, let me write down the matrix S. So S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So A_y is c multiplied by this S matrix. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, but the question is about finding the eigenvalues of A_y. So I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix.

The eigenvalues of a matrix M are found by solving the characteristic equation det(M - λ I) = 0.

So let me compute that. The matrix A_y is (h/(4π)) times S. Let me denote c = h/(4π) for simplicity. So A_y = c * S.

So A_y - a I = c S - a I.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, so a is the eigenvalue of A_y. So to find a, I'll compute the determinant of (A_y - a I), which is (c S - a I) and set it to zero.

Wait, but S is a 2x2 matrix, so maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues of S first, and then multiply by c to get the eigenvalues of A_y.

Yes, that's a good approach. Because if S has eigenvalues s, then c S will have eigenvalues c*s.

So let me find the eigenvalues of S.

The matrix S:
[0   -i]
[i    0]

The trace of S is 0 + 0 = 0.
The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - ( - (-1) ), since i² = -1. Wait, let me compute that again.

The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i*i) = 0 - ( - (i²) ) = 0 - ( - (-1) ) because i squared is -1. So that's 0 - (1) = -1? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, (-i) * i = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - ( -i^2 ) = 0 - ( -(-1) )= 0 - (1) = -1? Hmm.

Wait, but the determinant for a 2x2 matrix [[a,b],[c,d]] is ad - bc.

So for S:
a=0, b=-i
c=i, d=0
So determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - ( - (-1) ) because i squared is -1. So that's 0 - (1) = -1. So the determinant is -1.

Wait, but the determinant of S is (0)(0) - ( (-i) * i ) = 0 - ( -i^2 ) = 0 - ( -(-1) )= 0 -1 = -1. So determinant is -1.

The trace is 0, so the characteristic equation is λ² - (trace) λ + determinant = 0 → λ² + (-1) = 0 → λ^2 = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1.

Then, the eigenvalues of A_y = c S are c * 1 = c and c * (-1) = -c.

Wait, c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of A_y are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Let me check the options:

Option A) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are ±2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). Hmm, but our eigenvalues are real. Wait, no. The eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Both are real numbers, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A can't be correct because it's talking about the imaginary parts being non-zero.

Option B) Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that's not right either because the eigenvalues are real, and they're h/(4π) and its negative. So unless h/(4π) is 1/2, which would require h to be 2π, but Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So I don't think that's the case. So option B's eigenvalues are real and ±1, which doesn't match.

Option C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm, the eigenfunctions of A_y are the same as for S, which are the eigenstates of S. Since S is part of the angular momentum operator, I think that the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A² as well because angular momentum components commute with the square of the angular momentum. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the square of the angular momentum (like L²) commutes with each component (Lx, Ly, Lz). So if a state is an eigenstate of Ly, it's also an eigenstate of L² and Lz, but not necessarily of another component like Lx. So in this case, if Ay is the y-component of some angular momentum, then the eigenfunctions would be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az? Wait, no, because the components don't commute. So for example, if a state is an eigenstate of Ly, it's not an eigenstate of Lx or Lz, unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate. Wait, but L² commutes with all the components, so eigenstates of L² and Ly would be the same as eigenstates of L² and any component. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the question is about whether the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². I think yes, because A² (the square of the angular momentum) and Ay are compatible observables. So their eigenfunctions can be the same. But can the eigenfunctions of Ay also be eigenfunctions of Az? I don't think so because Ay and Az don't commute. So maybe option C is correct. But let's hold on and see the other options.

Option D) The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure about that. The eigenfunctions are the basis vectors, so maybe it's true. But I'm not certain.

Wait, going back: the eigenvalues of Ay are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Let me check the options again.

Looking at option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. So, whether that's correct. Let's think about angular momentum.

In quantum mechanics, for orbital angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of L_z are the spherical harmonics, and eigenfunctions of L² are the same, but not of L_x or L_y, except in specific cases. So if a state is an eigenstate of L_y, it's an eigenstate of L², but not of L_z. So that would make option C correct. Because if the eigenfunctions of Ay are those of S, which is a component of the spin (since S is here the matrix for spin, perhaps), then the eigenfunctions would be eigenfunctions of S², which is A² = (c S)^2. So option C says they can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. That seems correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So maybe the correct eigenvalues are real and given by ± c. So looking at the options, none of the options A or B directly state that the eigenvalues are real and ±c.

Looking again:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is impossible because our eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That can't be right because the eigenvalues are purely real.

So the correct eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So none of the options A or B match. So then, the correct statements must be either C or D.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π). Let me reevaluate the problem.

Wait, wait a second. The matrix S is given, and A_y = c * S. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute the eigenvalues again.

The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0.

So for S, the matrix is:

[ -λ    -i ]
[ i     -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (-i^2) = λ² - ( - (-1) ) → λ² - 1 = 0 → λ² =1 → λ= ±1. So yes, the eigenvalues of S are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A_y = c S are c*(1) = c and c*(-1) = -c.

So the eigenvalues are c and -c, where c is h/(4π). So, in terms of actual numbers, the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Looking at the options, which option's eigenvalues match with this?

Wait, looking at option C and D again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that means. The eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator's representation, but perhaps that's not the correct way to think about it. Because any matrix has its own set of eigenvectors, which form a basis, but the statement is a bit vague. So I'm not sure if D is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So, since A² is (c S)^2 = c² S². Let's compute S^2.

S squared is S multiplied by S.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S^2 is:

Row 1: [ (0)(0) + (-i)(i), (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) ) ] → [ (0 + (-i^2)), 0 ] → [ (-(-1)), 0 ] → [1, 0]

Row 2: [ (i)(0) + (0)(i), (i)(-i) + (0)(0) ) ] → [0, (-i^2) ] → [ 0, 1 ]

So S^2 is the identity matrix [[1,0],[0,1]]. So S^2 = I.

So A² = (c S)^2 = c² S² = c² I. So the eigenvalues of A² are c² and c², because for any eigenvector of S, when you apply S², you get 1 times the vector.

Wait, no. Wait, for any vector, S^2 acting on it is the identity, so the eigenvalue is 1. So the eigenvalues of S² are 1 and 1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A² = (c S)^2 is (c^2) * (S^2), which is c^2 * 1. So A² has eigenvalue c^2 for both eigenvectors.

Thus, any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A², because A² is a multiple of the identity matrix. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A². So option C says that they can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A_y and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.

So option C is correct.

Looking at the other options:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, perhaps, but I think that's not necessarily true. The operator's eigenfunctions are part of the basis, but it's a bit of a wording issue. I'm not certain, so I'll go with option C being correct.


To solve the problem, we analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( S \)
The eigenvalues of \( S \) are found by solving the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(S - \lambda I) = 0.
\]

Substituting \( S \), the characteristic equation becomes:

\[
\det\begin{bmatrix} 
-\lambda & -i \\ 
i & -\lambda 
\end{bmatrix} = \lambda^2 - (-i)(i) = \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

Solving this, the eigenvalues of \( S \) are:

\[
\lambda = \pm 1.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are scaled by \( c \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are:

\[
a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

These eigenvalues are purely real, with no imaginary components.

### Step 3: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real, not complex.

- **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

- **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 = (c S)^2 = c^2 S^2 \), and \( S^2 = I \) (the identity matrix). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

- **Option D**: Claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is ambiguous and not necessarily true, as the eigenfunctions are specific to the operator and do not inherently form the basis of the operator itself.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).
