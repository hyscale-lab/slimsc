Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, none of the particles were found outside between x=1 and x=3. So they're only found in that region.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a certain region is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1 because the total probability is 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. Oh right, because the wave functions can be complex. So when you take the absolute value squared, you have to compute the modulus squared.

The modulus squared of a complex number z = a + ib is z * z*, where z* is the complex conjugate. So for ψ(x)= (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, the conjugate ψ*(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying them together: ψ*ψ = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because the cross terms (the ones with i) would cancel out when you multiply. Let me check that. Let me compute (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b². Oh right, so yes, it's (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.25).

So the probability density is ψ*ψ = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, but wait. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I write ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i, then ψ* is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So ψ*ψ is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5i)(-0.5i) which is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.25).

Wait, because (i)(-i) is 1. Let's see: (a/sqrt(1+x) )^2 = a²/(1+x). Then, the cross terms: (a/sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5i * (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i) ... Wait, no, maybe I should just expand it properly.

The product is (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) * (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) = (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Hmm, the middle terms might cancel. Let's compute:

= (a²)/(1+x) + [0.5i * a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i * a/sqrt(1+x)] ) + (0.25 i²)

Wait, the middle terms: 0.5i * a/sqrt(1+x) minus 0.5i * a/sqrt(1+x) would be zero. So that leaves us with (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 (i² is -1, so 0.25*(-1) is -0.25? Wait, no:

Wait, ψ*ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5i)(-0.5i) = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25 i^2 * (-1))? Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me compute (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So in this case, a is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and b is 0.5i. So ψ*ψ = a² - (0.5i)^2.

Wait, (0.5i)^2 is (0.5)^2 * i^2 = 0.25 * (-1) = -0.25. So ψ*ψ = (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Ah, that's correct. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the square of the modulus should be real and positive. So yes, because (a²)/(1+x) is positive, and 0.25 is positive. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me think about normalization. The integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1 because when we measure, all the probability is in x between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be normalized such that the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ|^2 dx equals 1.

So I need to compute the integral of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1.

Let me write that integral out:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Breaking this into two separate integrals:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to3 = 1.

Compute each part.

First integral: a² * ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x).

So from x=1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Putting it all together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of 0.7213. Let's compute that.

What's sqrt(0.7213)? Let me think. 0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.85^2 is 0.7225. Oh, that's close. So sqrt(0.7213) is a little less than 0.85.

Wait, 0.85 squared is 0.7225. Our a² is approximately 0.7213, which is 0.7213 ≈ 0.7225 - 0.0012. So a is about 0.85 - (a small amount). Let me compute 0.85^2=0.7225.

So 0.85^2 = 0.7225.

Our a^2 is 0.7213, which is 0.0012 less than 0.7225. So a is a bit less than 0.85. Let me think about how much. Since (0.85 - delta)^2 = 0.7213.

Approximate using linear approximation. Let’s let delta be small. (0.85 - delta)^2 ≈ 0.85^2 - 2*0.85*delta = 0.7225 - 1.7 delta.

Set equal to 0.7213:

0.7225 - 1.7 delta ≈ 0.7213

So 1.7 delta ≈ 0.7225 - 0.7213 = 0.0012.

So delta ≈ 0.0012 / 1.7 ≈ 0.0007.

So a ≈ 0.85 - 0.0007 ≈ 0.8493.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is 0.85. So that's very close.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check.

Wait, because the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|^2, it's [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because the imaginary parts cancel, as we saw earlier.

Wait, no, the cross terms are (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i) plus (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (0.5i), which sum to zero. So yes, |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral becomes:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² = (0.5) / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let's see the options again. The options are:

A) 1.1

B) 0.85

C) 0.35

D) 0.6

So option B is 0.85, which matches our calculation. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The wave function is normalized such that the total probability of finding the particle between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \) is 1. Therefore, we compute the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First integral**:  
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx
\]
The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. **Second integral**:  
\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx
\]
This is straightforward:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Adding the two results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
