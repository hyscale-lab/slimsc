Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm going to try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are from A to D, each with different exponents on r.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d. Or was it d = 1/plx? Wait, I think that's right because as distance increases, parallax decreases.

So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So if I have plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. That makes sense. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx in terms of d, I can write it in terms of d.

Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting, 1/(plx)^5 becomes (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. So when d increases, N increases as the fifth power. But wait, wait—no, wait. Because plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) is (d^5). So N is proportional to d^5. So N increases as the distance to the fifth power.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So that's the number of stars per unit distance, right? Because per unit range of distance, r. So it's the density, perhaps.

Wait, no. The question is a bit ambiguous in wording. It says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." Oh, wait, perhaps they mean the number of stars per unit distance. So it's the density of stars as a function of distance from us.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance would be N per dr. So if we have N ∝ d^5, then the number per unit distance is (d^5) / dr, which is d^5.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If the number of stars up to a distance d is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars between d and d + dr is the derivative of that with respect to d. So dN/dr would be 5d^4.

But wait, I think I might be getting confused. Let me approach this more systematically.

We have N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, that's N ∝ d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, actually, the number of stars in a region would be a function of volume, because the number depends on how much volume you're looking at. But wait, in this case, the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps it's the count within a certain volume.

Wait, no, maybe the way the question is phrased, it's that the number of stars in a unit area of the sky varies as 1/plx^5. Because parallax relates to distance, and for a given area, the number might be a function of distance.

Wait, let's think about the distance modulus or something. The number of stars in a certain direction (so same area of the sky) would depend on the volume that we're looking into. The volume increases with distance cubed, I think. Because volume is proportional to distance cubed for a sphere.

Wait, but the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which with plx=1/d is N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So if N increases with d^5, then the number per unit distance would be d^5 per d, which is d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the density) would be proportional to d^4.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me model it. Suppose we have a region of the sky, and we're looking in all directions. The number of stars at a certain distance would relate to the volume. So N is proportional to the volume, which is (4/3)πd³. But wait, if the number of stars is proportional to the volume, which would be d³, then N ∝ d³. But in this problem, the number is proportional to d^5, so that suggests a different relation.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the number of stars per unit area (since it's a specific region of the sky) varies with parallax. So if I have a certain area, say a square parsec, then the number of stars in that area would depend on how far away you are looking. Because as you look further, each unit area has more stars. But normally, the number of stars per unit area would increase with distance squared, because the flux is like d². Wait, maybe that's getting into surface brightness. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the number density of stars is such that N is proportional to d^5. So when you look further away, the number of stars increases more rapidly—fifth power. But that seems very high.

Wait, another approach. The given relation is N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N = k * d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So it's looking for the derivative dN/dr.

So if N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. Therefore, the change is proportional to r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing N and dN. So the question says, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range. So perhaps it's the change in N per unit change in r. So dN/dr is 5k d^4.

So the number of stars per unit distance (the rate) is proportional to d^4. So as distance increases, the number of stars per unit distance increases as the fourth power. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think about it again. If you have a region of the sky, and for each unit of distance, how many stars are there. So if N is the number of stars within a certain distance, then dN/dr would give the number added per unit distance. So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr ∝ d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

So in that case, the answer would be option C, which is ~r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial statement. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps it's not the total number up to that distance, but the number per unit distance. Wait, but that would complicate things.

Wait, another way to think about it: number of stars per unit area per unit distance. Because parallax is related to distance, and if the question is about the number of stars in a specific region, which has a certain solid angle.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm thinking of number density. Alternatively, let's consider stars in a thin shell at distance d. The volume of that shell is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, so N_shell = k * 4πd² dr. So N_shell ∝ d² dr. That's under the assumption that the number of stars is proportional to volume, which is d^3, but in a shell, it's d² dr.

Wait, but the given relation in the problem is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So that's a different scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the number of stars in a region of the sky is inversely proportional to the fifth power of parallax. So if stars are more numerous at larger distances, which would make sense because when you look further, you see more stars, but the density in the sense of per unit area might be higher.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to approach it mathematically.

Given: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

If the question is about the number of stars in the region, as a function of distance, and how it changes with distance (per unit distance), that's the derivative dN/dr.

So dN/dr = dN/d(d) = 5N/(d).

Wait, let me write N as proportional to d^5, so N = k d^5. Then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the change in number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

So as the distance r increases, the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

So the answer would be option C) ~ r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the given relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), which represents the number of stars per unit distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
