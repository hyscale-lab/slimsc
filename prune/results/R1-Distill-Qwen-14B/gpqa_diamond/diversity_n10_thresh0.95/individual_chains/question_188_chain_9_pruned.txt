Okay, I've got this question about crystallography here. Hmm, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

So, I remember that for crystals, especially with different structures like cubic or rhombohedral, the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula derived from the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices of the plane.

The formula I recall is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), but wait, maybe I got that mixed up. Or was it another formula? Oh right, in a general crystal system, the interplanar distance can be found using the relation involving the reciprocal lattice vectors. Another approach is using the Bragg's law formula, but that's more about the angles and the planes in terms of the crystal structure.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal system? Or no, wait, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system but with all edges equal and all angles equal but not 90 degrees. Right, so in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and the angles α = β = γ. Oh, but wait, in this problem, all the angles are 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral crystal with a = b = c, and angles α=β=γ=30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between adjacent atoms, which in the crystal corresponds to the unit cell edge length 'a'. So a = 10 Angstroms.

Now, the question is to find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ), but wait, isn't that the formula for the distance between planes in a non-orthogonal crystal system?

Wait, let me think again. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ), but wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Because I've heard that for a cubic system, the formula simplifies a lot because angles are 90 degrees.

Wait, in a cubic system, the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But this is for cubic systems. However, in a non-cubic system, like here with rhombohedral, the formula is more complex because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

So for a general crystal, the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = [ (a^2 (b c sin ρ)) / (h b^2 + k c^2 + l a^2 - terms involving cosines) ]^(1/2) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / [sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hk cos β + kl cos γ) ) ]? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing the terms. Let's think.

Another approach: The general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal is given by:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk \cos \alpha - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos \gamma )}} \times \sqrt{\frac{a^2 b^2 c^2}{(a^2 (b c \sin \alpha)^2 + ... )} }

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula involving the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is given by:

g = [ [ a², ab cos γ, ac cos β ],
      [ ab cos γ, b², bc cos α ],
      [ ac cos β, bc cos α, c² ] ]

But for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and all angles are equal α=β=γ=θ.

So the metric tensor becomes:

g = [
  [ a², a² cos θ, a² cos θ ],
  [ a² cos θ, a², a² cos θ ],
  [ a² cos θ, a² cos θ, a² ]
]

The reciprocal metric tensor g^(-1) is needed to find the interplanar spacing. The (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vector with components (h, k, l). The interplanar distance d is found using the formula:

d^2 = \frac{1}{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ)}}

Wait, no—maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = \sqrt{ (1/h^2 + 1/k^2 + 1/l^2 - 2 cos θ (1/(h k) + 1/(h l) + 1/(k l)) )^{-1} }

Wait, that doesn't seem right. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, another formula I recall is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

But in this case, since it's a rhombohedral crystal, all a = b = c, and all angles are same, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So for the (111) plane, h = k = l =1.

So substituting into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) - 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

Let's compute the denominator.

First, compute the sum (1+1+1) =3.

Then compute the second term: 2*(3 terms each with cos30). So each term is cos30, and there are three such terms. So 2*(1+1+1)*cos30 = 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3√3.

Wait, wait no. Let me compute step by step.

The denominator is sqrt( (3) - 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( 3 - 2*(3 * cos30) )

Because each pair hk, hl, kl is 1*1, and there are three pairs, each contributes 2*1*1*cosθ. So 2*(3 * cos30) = 6 cos30. So denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 6 cos30.

cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 cos30 = 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, the denominator inside the sqrt is negative? That can't be right because the sqrt of a negative number isn't real. That suggests that my formula is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe it's (hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) instead of all cos30. Wait, in our case, all angles are 30 degrees, so maybe it's the same regardless.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for d is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) )

But in this case, since α=β=γ=30°, let's substitute:

d = a / sqrt( (3) - 2*(3 * cos30) )

Which is a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

Wait, that would make denominator sqrt(3 - 6*(√3/2) ) = sqrt( 3 - 3√3 )

But 3√3 is about 5.196, so 3-5.196 is negative. That's impossible.

Hmm, that suggests that using this formula gives an imaginary number, which can't be correct. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another thought: the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but maybe the angles are not all the same. Or perhaps I'm missing other terms.

Wait, another formula I found once: for a rhombohedral system (a=b=c, α=β=γ), the interplanar distance is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Where θ is the angle α=β=γ.

So in this case, θ=30°. So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2*(3) cos30 )

Wait, 3 comes from h² +k² + l² = 1+1+1=3.

The second term: 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ. Since h=k=l=1, hk + hl + kl = 3.

So 2*3 cos30 = 6 cos30 ≈5.196.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 -5.196) = sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. Impossible.

This suggests that perhaps the formula uses cos(180 - θ) instead, but that would be cos(150), which is negative. Let me try that.

Wait, maybe the angles in the formula are the angles between the axes, which in a rhombohedral system are all acute or all obtuse. Wait, no, rhombohedral has angles less than 90°, I think.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but that would give 3 + 6*(√3/2) = 3 + 5.196=8.196, sqrt of that is about 2.863, which gives d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms. But the options are around 9 Angstrom, so that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Maybe another approach: in a cubic system with all angles 90°, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). For the (111) plane, d would be a/√3. If a=10, d=10/√3≈5.77 Angstroms. But that's not any of the options. So perhaps in this problem, the angles are 30°, which would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system as:

d = [a² (1 + 2 cosθ)]^(-1/2)

Wait, but that's probably for a specific case. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the general formula for interplanar distance in terms of the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. The general formula for d is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - 2 (h k cosγ)/(a b) - 2 (h l cosβ)/(a c) - 2 (k l cosα)/(b c) } }

Since in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and all angles are the same, let's denote α=β=γ=θ. So the formula becomes:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)/(a0^2) - 2 [ (h k cosθ + h l cosθ + k l cosθ ) ]/(a0^2) } } 

Simplify the denominator:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 (h k + h l + k l) cosθ )

Which is the same as the formula I used earlier. So the denominator is sqrt(3 - 6 cos30) which is sqrt(3 - 5.196) = sqrt(-2.196). That's not possible, which suggests I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait another thought. Perhaps the formula is written with cos(180 - θ) instead of cosθ. Because sometimes in crystallography, the angle between the axes is the acute or obtuse angle, depending on the system.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angles are acute. Because rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system? Or is it part of the cubic system. Hmm, not entirely sure. Wait, no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system, but with all angles equal but not 90 degrees. So they can be either acute (like 60 degrees, leading to a 'positive' rhombohedral system) or obtuse (like 120 degrees, leading to a 'negative' rhombohedral system). 

Wait, but the formula for d must give a real positive value. So perhaps when the angles are greater than 90 degrees, we have to take the cos as negative. Let me think again.

Wait, in our problem, the angle is 30 degrees, which is acute. So cos30 is positive. But substituting as before gives a negative value under the square root.

That can't be. So perhaps I've got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula has a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 (h k cos(180 - α) + h l cos(180 - β) + k l cos(180 - γ) ) )

But wait, that would make cos(150 degrees) = -sqrt(3)/2. So let's try that.

So for each cos(180 - θ), where θ=30°, it's cos150° = -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.8660.

So substituting into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2 [hk*(-0.866) + hl*(-0.866) + kl*(-0.866) ] )

Wait, since h=k=l=1, each of hk, hl, kl is 1.

So denominator inside sqrt becomes 3 - 2*(3*(-0.866)).

Which is 3 - 2*(-2.598) = 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

Then d= a / 2.863.

a=10 Angstroms, so d≈10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms. But the options are in the 8-10 range, so that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm still wrong. Let me think of an alternative approach.

Another thought: The interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can also be calculated using the formula:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ } }

Wait, but θ is 30 degrees. Let's compute this.

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 2*(3)*cos30 =3 + 6*(0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.863. So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom again. But the answer options are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

h=k=l=1, so denominator is sqrt(3 + 2*(3 *0.866) ) = sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863. So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are around 9 Angstrom. That's way higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor in the formula.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral crystal can be found using the formula:

d = \frac{a}{
