Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, and I need to choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, first, I remember that the decay of a particle depends on the available energy and the mass of the products. Since X is a boson, I guess it's a spin-0 particle, so its decay products must have a total spin that's compatible. But wait, the problem says this is the lowest order, so maybe spin considerations aren't as important here.

The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that again. Oh, perhaps it's a Yukawa interaction term. In Yukawa theory, the Lagrangian typically has a term like g ψ ψ X, with X being the boson. So in this case, the coupling is between the fermion fields ψ and the scalar X.

The fermion here is probably a quark or another kind of fermion. The term includes f and f-bar, so maybe X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So the decay X → f f-bar would be possible if the mass of X is greater than twice the mass of the fermion.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So for each fermion, their mass should be less than half of that, so less than 3 GeV. Let's list out the possible fermions.

Fermions include quarks, leptons, etc. Let me think about their masses. Up quark is about 2 MeV, down quark similar, strange is around 100 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom is around 4.5 GeV. Oh wait, bottom is about 4.5 GeV. So the mass of the X is 6 GeV. So for a pair, the mass would be 2 * 4.5 =9 GeV. Wait, but X is only 6 GeV, so 6 is less than 9, so X can't decay into b b-bar. Because 6 < 9 GeV, so that's not kinematically allowed. So any option that includes b b-bar is wrong, I think.

So looking at the options, option A includes b b-bar, option D includes it. So A and D are out. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the fermion masses.

Wait, the top quark is around 173 GeV, so way too heavy. Bottom is about 4.5 GeV, correct. So 2 * 4.5 is 9. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So any option with b b-bar is invalid. So A and D are out.

Now, let's look at the other options. Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. Let's check the masses for each.

Charm quark: about 1.2-1.5 GeV, so 2 * 1.5=3 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so yes, possible. Same for s quark: about 100 MeV, so 2*0.1=0.2 well under 6 GeV. Up and down are negligible, so their pairs are allowed. Tau is about 1.77 GeV each, so 3.54 GeV total. So 6 is more than 3.54, so that's allowed. Electron is way too light, so e+ e- is possible.

What about muons? Muon mass is about 0.1 GeV, so 0.2 GeV total. So allowed. So option B includes all these, except tau and muon. Wait, no, option B has tau and e, but no mu? Let me check: option B says tau+ tau- and e+ e-. But does it have mu? No. So in the options, looking at the choices.

Wait, the options are:

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

Wait, does it include mu? No. So it's missing mu. But the X is 6 GeV, which is enough for mu pairs.

Wait, but why would the Lagrangian matter here? Because the interaction is given by the Lagrangian, which is L ~ f f-bar X. So the boson X can decay into any fermion pair (f f-bar) that it couples to. So the coupling is to all fermions f? Or only certain ones?

Wait, the given Lagrangian is written as -λ f f-bar X. So perhaps f is a specific fermion, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So the general term is for any fermion. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass allows it.

Wait, but wait, in the Lagrangian, it's written as f and f-bar. So does that mean X couples to all fermions, or only a specific one?

Wait, the notation might be a bit confusing. The term is -λ f f-bar X, perhaps implying that X couples to all possible fermions. So the decay X → f f-bar is possible for any fermion f, provided that the mass is sufficient.

But wait, if X is a scalar (assuming so, since it's a boson without further info), then the decay would be allowed for any fermion for which X has a coupling. So if X couples to all fermions, then any fermion pair with combined mass ≤6 GeV is allowed.

So which fermions have mass less than 3 GeV each? Let's list them:

- Up quark: ~2 MeV → 2 * 2 = 4 MeV → allowed.
- Down quark: same as up.
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV → 2 * 100 = 200 MeV → allowed.
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV → 3 GeV total → allowed.
- Bottom quark: 4.5 GeV → 9 GeV total → not allowed.
- Top: way too heavy.

Leptons:

- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV → allowed.
- Muon: ~0.1 GeV → 0.2 GeV → allowed.
- Tau: ~1.77 GeV → 3.54 GeV → allowed.

So, any fermion pair with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each is allowed.

So possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but wait. Tau is about 1.77 GeV, so 3.54 GeV for tau pair. X is 6 GeV, so that's allowed.

So possible decay channels are:

X → u u-bar,
X → d d-bar,
X → s s-bar,
X → c c-bar,
X → e+ e-,
X → mu+ mu-,
X → tau+ tau-.

So which options include all of these except the ones with higher mass?

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, but that's excluded. So A is wrong.

Option B: X → c, s, u, d, tau, e. So this includes all except mu, because in option B, the decay products are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. So missing mu pair.

Option C: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+, mu+, e+ e-. Wait, but t is top quark, which is 173 GeV, so 2*173=346 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so decay into top is impossible. So option C is incorrect because it includes top.

Option D: includes b, so that's out.

Wait, so the correct decay channels should include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But looking at the options, only option B includes tau and e, but not mu. Option D includes b, which is wrong. So where's the option that includes mu+ mu-?

Wait, looking back at the options. Let me check each option again.

Option A: X → b, s, u, d, tau, e. Includes b, so wrong.

Option B: X → c, s, u, d, tau, e. No mu.

Option C: includes t, which is wrong.

Option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Includes b, which is wrong.

Wait, none of the options seem to include all possible allowed decay channels except for option B and D. But option B misses mu, and D includes b which is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering which fermions are allowed. Let me think: the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where 2m_f ≤6 GeV. So m_f ≤3 GeV.

Charm: ~1.5 GeV → allowed.

Tau: ~1.77 GeV → 1.77 *2=3.54 GeV → allowed.

Muon: ~0.1 GeV → 0.2 GeV → allowed.

So all of u, d, s, c, mu, e, tau are allowed.

Looking again at the options:

Which option includes all of these except for the ones with higher masses (like b, which is excluded)?

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, e, but not mu. Option D includes mu but also includes b (which is wrong). So none of the options seem to have all the allowed decay paths.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's Lagrangian. The problem states that the interaction is given by L = -λ f f-bar (v + X) ψ_f. Oh wait, perhaps I misread the Lagrangian. Wait, the term is written as -λ f f-bar (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Maybe it's a Yukawa coupling term, like L = g f ψ X ψ_f, but perhaps I'm not parsing it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction term is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps it's a typo, but perhaps the interaction is between X and a fermion ψ_f. So X couples to ψ_f. So the boson X can decay into ψ_f and its anti-particle.

But in that case, the decay would only be possible into ψ_f and ψ_f-bar, but the options suggest decays into various fermions.

Wait, perhaps the fermions in the Lagrangian are all the possible ones, so X can decay into any of them, provided the mass allows. So the available decay modes are all the fermion pairs (u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau) but not b or t.

So the correct decay modes would include all except b and t.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, e. Missing mu.

Option D includes mu and tau but includes b, which is wrong.

Hmm, but none of the options include all the correct decay modes. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the interaction is only with a specific fermion, but the question says "fermions" in general.

Wait, perhaps the fermion ψ in the Lagrangian is a specific one, like the electron or something else. Wait, the notation is a bit unclear. The interaction is written as:

L(y) = -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, maybe that's a typo, but perhaps it's an interaction term coupling X to a fermion ψ_f. So perhaps X can decay into ψ_f and its antiparticle.

But then the decay would only be into that specific fermion, but the options suggest multiple decay channels. So perhaps the problem is intended to assume that X can decay into any available fermion pair, so all possible pairs with mass less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't include any that have all these. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the possible fermions.

Wait, perhaps the Lagrangian is written with ψ_f being the fermion, like ψ_f is the electron, and X can only decay into electrons. But that doesn't fit the options. Because the options have multiple decay channels.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the fermion in the interaction is 'f', which is any fermion, so X can decay into any fermion pair. So the mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV for the sum of two fermions.

So, for each fermion pair, their combined mass must be ≤6 GeV. So for each individual fermion, mass must be ≤3 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are:

- u (2 MeV)
- d (2 MeV)
- s (95 MeV)
- c (1.5 GeV)
- e (0.0005 GeV)
- mu (0.1 GeV)
- tau (1.77 GeV)

So all these fermions are allowed except b and t.

So the decay channels are:

X → u u-bar,
X → d d-bar,
X → s s-bar,
X → c c-bar,
X → e+ e-,
X → mu+ mu-,
X → tau+ tau-.

Now looking at the options again:

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, e. So missing mu.

Option D: includes mu, tau, e, s, u, d, but includes b, which is wrong.

Hmm, none of the options seem to include mu. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the interaction doesn't couple to mu or tau. But why would that be?

Wait, the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by [...]". So it's a general interaction, meaning X can decay into any fermion pair, as long as kinematically allowed.

So, the correct decay modes should include all the possible fermion pairs listed above except b and t.

So the correct answer should have all the decay channels except b and t.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e- → missing mu pair.

Option D: X → b, which is wrong.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that includes all seven decay channels (u, d, s, c, mu, e, tau). So perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because option B is the only one that includes c, s, u, d, tau, and e, but not b, but it's missing mu.

Wait, but why would option B not include mu? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term only includes certain fermions. For example, if the interaction is with charged leptons only, then mu and e would be allowed, but tau isn't. But that doesn't make sense because tau is a charged lepton.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is only with up-type quarks, but that's not indicated in the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the given Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f f-bar X, meaning that X can only decay into a specific fermion, but the question states "fermions" in general, which suggests all.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass is 6 GeV, which is about the mass of the D meson or similar. So in reality, particles at that mass can decay into lighter quarks and leptons.

But in any case, the options don't include an option that includes mu. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, let me reevaluate the mass limits. X is 6 GeV.

Each fermion must have mass less than 3 GeV.

So for each fermion:

u, d, s: allowed.

c: allowed (1.5 GeV).

e: allowed.

mu: allowed (0.1 GeV).

tau: allowed (1.77 GeV), since 1.77*2=3.54 GeV <6 GeV.

So all these are allowed.

So the boson can decay into any of these fermion pairs.

Looking at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, e. That's six decay channels. It doesn't include mu. Option D includes mu but also includes b, which is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option isn't present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the decay into tau.

Wait, wait a second. The mass of X is 6 GeV. The tau has a mass of about 1.77 GeV. So the sum for tau pair is 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

So the possible decay channels are as I thought before.

Looking back at the options, only option B includes tau but misses mu. Option D, which includes mu, is invalid because it includes b.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the interaction only allows certain fermions.

Wait, perhaps the fermion in the interaction is a specific one, like s quark. But the question says "fermions" in general. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the charges.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interaction term is written as f f-bar X, implying that X couples to all fermions, but in reality, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to all fermions, but other bosons like the photon (which is massless) can't decay into fermions unless it's a virtual process.

But in this case, X is a boson with mass 6 GeV, so it can decay into any fermion pair with sum of masses ≤6 GeV.

So the allowed decay channels must include all the fermions with mass ≤3 GeV each.

So the correct answer would include u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

But none of the options include all of these. Let me check the options again.

Option A: includes b, which is wrong. So A is out.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, e. Missing mu.

Option C: includes t, which is wrong. So C is out.

Option D: includes b, which is wrong.

Wait, but perhaps the answer is option B, assuming that mu isn't included in the Lagrangian's coupling? Or perhaps I'm missing a detail.

Wait another thought: maybe the fermion in the Lagrangian is a charged lepton, so only e, mu, tau, but not quarks. But that contradicts the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is between X and the top quark, but no, top is too heavy.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is only with up-type quarks, but the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is written in a way that the fermion is a specific one, say, the lepton f. Then X can only decay into that lepton and its anti-lepton. But in that case, the options would have only one decay channel, which isn't the case.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which includes all the fermions except mu and b. But why isn't mu included in option B? Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in the mass consideration.

Wait, muon mass is about 0.105 GeV. So 2 * 0.105 = 0.21 GeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into mu+ mu-.

So why isn't option B including mu? Let me check the options again.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. So it's missing mu.

Hmm, perhaps the problem has a typo, but given the options, the best fit would be option B. Because all the other options either include b or t, which are too heavy, while option B includes all the allowed fermion pairs except mu and maybe others.

Wait, but the correct decay channels should include mu as well. So perhaps the correct option isn't present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is for vector bosons, but X is a scalar. So for a scalar X, any spin-0 state can decay into any fermion pair as long as the mass allows. So the decay X → f f-bar is allowed for any f where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So given that, the allowed decay modes should include all the fermions except b and t.

But the options don't have an option that includes all of them except b, but looking again:

Option B) X→c, s, u, d, tau, e: missing mu.

Option D) X→b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e: includes b, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but the option hasn't included mu because of a mistake, but given the options, that's the only possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's check the possible fermion pairs.

Each fermion's mass:

u: 2 MeV → ok.

d: same as u.

s: ~100 MeV → ok.

c: ~1.5 GeV → ok.

e: ~0.0005 GeV → ok.

mu: ~0.1 GeV → ok.

tau: ~1.77 GeV → ok.

b: ~4.5 GeV → 9 GeV for pair → not allowed.

So all except b and t are allowed.

So the correct decay modes include c, s, u, d, e, mu, tau.

Looking at the options, only option B includes tau and e, but not mu.

Hmm, perhaps I need to choose the best possible option despite that. Or perhaps the answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but that's not including mu. Maybe the problem expects that X can decay into any fermion except the bottom and top.

But again, the options don't include an option with all the correct decay modes except for b and t.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, because it includes the heavier quarks (c, s) and the lighter leptons (e, tau). But that leaves out mu. Or perhaps I'm missing something about the interaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the boson X can only decay into fermion pairs where the fermion is lighter than 3 GeV. So all the quarks except bottom, and all leptons.

So the correct decay modes are:

c, s, u, d, e, mu, tau.

So looking again, the only option that includes all except b is not present. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but it's missing mu. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but it includes b, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the original problem intended that the interaction only couples to certain fermions. For example, only the charged leptons or only the up-type quarks. But that's not stated in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B, despite missing mu.

Wait, another perspective: perhaps the fermion in the interaction is a specific one, like the electron, and the possible decays are into that fermion only. But that doesn't fit the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the mass is 6 GeV, which is about the mass of the D meson, which can decay into various quark pairs. But that's more about hadrons.

I'm a bit stuck. Let's see the options again.

The options are:

A) Includes b → not allowed.

B) Includes c, s, u, d, tau, e → missing mu.

C) Includes t → not allowed.

D) Includes b → not allowed.

So the only option left is B, but it's missing mu. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, but that's not including mu, which is allowed.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement considers that X cannot decay into neutrinos because they are neutral, but the options include e+ e- etc., which are charged.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the interaction is given by L = λ f f-bar X, so X can decay into any fermion pair as long as the coupling exists. But the problem says "the interaction between X and fermions", so X can decay into any fermion pair.

So the correct decay modes are all allowed except the ones that are too heavy.

Thus, the correct options should include all except b, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the given Lagrangian has ψ_f as the fermion field, implying that X couples to ψ_f, which is a specific fermion, like, say, the electron. But in that case, the decay would only be X→e+ e-, which isn't the case in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X can decay into any fermion with mass less than 6 GeV, but the options don't include all.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, as it includes all the allowed fermions except mu and including tau.

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time on this. Given that, the correct decay modes are all fermion pairs except b and t. Among the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, e, but not mu. So option B would be the closest, but I'm not sure why mu isn't included. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to exclude mu for some reason.

Another approach: perhaps the interaction term in the Lagrangian only involves charged fermions, but mu is charged, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant that X can decay into any fermion, but in the given interaction, perhaps only certain fermions are present. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that X couples to all fermions except the muon for some reason, but that's not stated.

In any case, given the options, the correct answer should be option B, which includes the possible decays except for mu. Alternatively, this might be a mistake in the options.

But wait, the option B includes tau, which is 1.77 GeV, so X can decay into tau pairs. So option B is correct except for missing mu. But why would mu be excluded?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the interaction. Maybe the interaction only couples to left-handed fermions or something, but that doesn't affect the decay possibilities in this context.

Hmm. Perhaps I should go with option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The decay of \( X \) into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) is allowed if the total mass of the pair is less than or equal to 6 GeV. This translates to the requirement that the mass of each fermion (\( m_f \)) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

Thus, the allowed decay modes of \( X \) are:
- \( X \to u \bar{u} \),
- \( X \to d \bar{d} \),
- \( X \to s \bar{s} \),
- \( X \to c \bar{c} \),
- \( X \to e^+ e^- \),
- \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \),
- \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed (as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, e^+ e^- \), but **misses \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)**. This is the closest match but is incomplete.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed (as \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct decay modes should include all fermion pairs with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which are \( u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \). However, none of the options fully include all these decay modes. Among the given options, **Option B** is the most complete, as it includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, e^+ e^- \), but it **misses \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)**. Despite this omission, Option B is the best available choice.

ANSWER: B
