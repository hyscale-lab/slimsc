Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix representation is Aij. The Aij elements are given as hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Then we also have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized. So the first step is to normalize it.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's denote |up> as |↑> and |down> as |↓> for simplicity.

So, |alpha> = (1+i)|↑> + (2 -i)|↓>.

To find the normalization factor, I should calculate the inner product <alpha|alpha>, which is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. The magnitude squared of (2-i) is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5. So the inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |↑> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |↓>.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the inner product is the sum of each component's magnitude squared. So for the state |alpha> = a|↑> + b|↓>, the inner product is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So |a|^2 is |1+i|^2, which is 1² +1² =2. |b|^2 is |2-i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So 2 +5 =7. So yes, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |↑> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |↓>.

Next, the operator whose matrix is A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So what's the matrix look like? The operator is 2x2 because we're dealing with spin-½ states (up and down). So the matrix A is:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Because, for i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2, otherwise 0. So it's a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, let me clarify. The operator's matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Hmm. Now, I think this operator is related to the Pauli matrices. Let me recall, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. But here, our matrix A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because if we factor out hbar/2, the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which is X. So A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are superpositions of |↑> and |↓>, specifically (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2) and (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2). Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so A has eigenvalues (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of A. So the possible measurement outcomes when measuring the operator A are the eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, and the states are the corresponding eigenvectors.

So the first thing we need to do is express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Then, the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients in that expansion.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, perhaps we can find the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of σ_x, which is the same as the eigenbasis of A.

So the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|↑> − |↓>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me check: σ_x |+x> = +|+x>, and σ_x |−x> = -|−x>.

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, we can write |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

Once we have that, the probability to measure hbar/2 is |c_+|^2, and the probability to measure -hbar/2 is |c_-|^2.

So let's compute that.

First, let's write |alpha> in terms of |↑> and |↓>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |↑> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |↓> 

We can express |↑> and |↓> in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

|↑> = (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2)
|↓> = (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(7) and 1/sqrt(2):

= 1/(sqrt(7) sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |−x>) ]

Let me compute the coefficients for |+x> and |−x>:

For |+x>:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i =3.

For |−x>:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 -2 +i +i = (-1) + 2i.

So putting it together:

|alpha> = [1/(sqrt(14)) ] [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x> ]

So the coefficients are:

c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14)
c_- = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14)

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute:

Wait, the calculation steps again:

[ (1+i) * (1) + (2 -i) * (1) ] for |+x> term.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express that:

The coefficient for |+x> is (1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) =3.

The coefficient for |−x> is (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) +2i.

So, yes, that's correct.

So |alpha> = (3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ) / sqrt(14)

Wait, because 1/sqrt(7)*1/sqrt(2) is 1/sqrt(14).

Now, to find the probabilities, we take the magnitude squared of c_+ and c_-.

Compute |c_+|^2 = |3|² / 14 =9/14 ≈0.6429.

Compute |c_-|^2 = | (-1 +2i) |^2 /14 → |√( (-1)^2 +2^2 ) |² /14 → √(1+4)=√5 → |√5|^2 is 5, so 5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, wait. Wait, |c_-|^2 is |(-1 + 2i)|² / 14.

The magnitude is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5). So the square is 5. So 5/14 ≈0.357. So the probabilities are approximately 0.6429 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches closely. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, approximately 0.6429 and 0.357.

But wait, the options don't give fractions but decimal approximations. Let's compute 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So the first part of the answer is probabilities 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36).

Wait, but what about the average value of the operator A? The expectation value <A> is calculated as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Because A is the operator with matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, else 0. Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) times σ_x, perhaps we can compute it using the expectation value of σ_x.

Since A = (hbar/2) σ_x, we can write <A> = (hbar/2) <sigma_x>.

So what's <sigma_x> for the state |alpha>?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let me write the matrix A as [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So in the basis of |↑> and |↓>, the operator is this matrix.

The state |alpha> is a column vector: [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

First, compute A multiplied by |alpha>.

Matrix multiplication:

A |alpha> = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So first component is 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) → (hbar/2)((2 -i)/sqrt(7)).

Second component is (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2-i)/sqrt(7) → (hbar/2)( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ).

So A|alpha> is [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ; (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Now, compute <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> times this vector.

The conjugate of |alpha> is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So:

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ; (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiply each component:

First term: (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) → (1 -i)(2 -i) (hbar/2) /7.

Second term: (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) → (2 +i)(1 +i) (hbar/2) /7.

Let me compute each part.

Compute (1 -i)(2 -i):

= (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i +i²
= 2 -3i -1 (since i²=-1)
= (2-1) -3i → 1 -3i.

Multiply by hbar/2, so first term is (1 -3i) * hbar/(2 *7) = (1-3i) hbar/(14).

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) → 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2 +2i +i -1 → (2-1) +3i → 1 +3i.

Multiply by hbar/2, so second term is (1 +3i) * hbar/(14).

Adding both terms:

(1 -3i +1 +3i) * hbar/(14) → (2) hbar/(14) → hbar/7.

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7. Option D says 2 hbar/sqrt(7), which is different.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → matches our calculations: 9/14≈0.64, 5/14≈0.36, and average hbar/7.

B) 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt(7) → no.

C) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt(7) → no.

D) 0.61, 0.29, 2 hbar / sqrt(7) → no.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again for the expectation value.

Alternative approach: since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x.

What is the expectation value of sigma_x for |alpha>?

The expectation value is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So |alpha> is [a; b] where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So sigma_x |alpha> = [ b; a ]

So <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = a* b* + b* a* ?

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, |alpha> is a column vector [a; b], where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2-i)/sqrt(7).

The conjugate transpose is [ a*, b* ].

sigma_x |alpha> = [ (0)(a) + (1)(b) ; (1)(a) + (0)(b) ] = [ b; a ].

So <sigma_x> = [ a*, b* ] [ b; a ] = a* b + b* a.

Which is a* b + b* a = 2 Re( a* b ).

Compute a* b: a* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

Wait, (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1-3i)/7.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7 → (2 +i)(1 +i)= 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2 + 3i -1 → 1 +3i.

So a* b + b* a = (1-3i +1 +3i)/7 → 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Thus, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So yes, that's correct.

So the average is hbar/7, which matches option A's third part.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and average hbar/7. So option A is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by calculating the inner product \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle \), which is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. The magnitudes squared are \( |1+i|^2 = 2 \) and \( |2-i|^2 = 5 \), so \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 2 + 5 = 7 \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, specifically \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. Thus, the eigenstates of \( A \) are the same, with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenstates of \( A \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). Using the relations:

\[
|\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle), \quad |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle),
\]

we substitute into \( |\alpha\rangle \) and simplify. The coefficients of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are calculated as:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as \( \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), where \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in \( |\alpha\rangle \). Using the relation \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \text{Re}(a^* b) \), with \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \), we find \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7} \). Thus, \( \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar / 7 \).**
