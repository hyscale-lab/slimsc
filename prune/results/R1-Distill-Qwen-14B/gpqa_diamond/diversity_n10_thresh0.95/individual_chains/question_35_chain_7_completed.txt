Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h divided by 4π. So, A_y = c * S. And S has a specific form: the first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Oh right, I think S must be related to the Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall their forms.

The sigma y matrix, σ_y, is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh wait, that's exactly what S is. So S must be σ_y. So A_y is c times σ_y.

The eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ. So I need to find the eigenvalues a and eigenvectors φ of A_y.

Since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0. Let me compute that.

First, A_y is c times S (which is σ_y). So A_y = c * σ_y. So the matrix is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]].

The characteristic equation is determinant of (A_y - a I) = 0. So the matrix becomes:

[ -a,   -i c ]
[ i c,  -a ]

Calculating the determinant: (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c² )

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So it's a² - (1 * c²) = a² - c² = 0.

So the eigenvalues are a = ± c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, and real part ±h/(4π). Wait, no. Wait, our eigenvalues are purely real, right? Because S is a Hermitian matrix multiplied by a real constant, so A_y is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but when I compute the eigenvalues, I got a squared equals c squared, so a = ±c. So they should be real. So the eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are real. So perhaps option B is wrong.

Option A talks about the imaginary parts being ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, no, the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect because it's claiming imaginary parts are non-zero, which they're not. So options A and B can't be correct because they suggest complex eigenvalues, but A_y is Hermitian, so eigenvalues have to be real.

So that leaves options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Wait, for angular momentum operators, the square of the angular momentum (like A²) commutes with each component, so if a state is an eigenstate of A_y and A², then it must also be an eigenstate of the other components (since A², A_y, and A_z form a commuting set). Wait, but wait, no. Because the components don't commute with each other. So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, it can't be an eigenstate of A_z, but it can be of A², because A² commutes with all components.

Wait, no. Wait, the square of angular momentum (like L²) commutes with each component (Lx, Ly, Lz), so if a state is an eigenstate of Ly and L², then it's an eigenstate of L², but not necessarily of Lx or Lz. So, in this case, the operator Ay is a component of the angular momentum. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay and A², then it can't be an eigenstate of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. That sounds correct.

Wait, but the question is about the properties during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So which statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this. The basis functions of the operator are probably the eigenvectors, so that would make sense. So the eigenfunctions are the basis, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the operator Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenfunctions. The basis for the space is typically taken as those eigenfunctions if they are orthogonal and complete. So perhaps D is correct as well.

Wait, but let's think again. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So any vector in the space can be written as a combination of these eigenvectors. So the statement in D is correct.

But let's backtrack: the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Looking at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

But if a function is an eigenfunction of Ay and A², then it's also an eigenfunction of A², which is correct. But it can't be an eigenfunction of Az, as Az is a component that doesn't commute with Ay. So this statement is correct.

But wait, actually, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something (maybe A_x). So their eigenstates are different. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since Ay is 2x2, the eigenfunctions form the basis, so D is correct.

So now, which options are correct? Let me look at the options again.

The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So looking for the correct statement.

Wait, let's think again about the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are real, ±h/(4π). So when considering the options, option B's eigenvalues don't fit, and option A's has imaginary parts—so they’re incorrect.

So option C and D are possible.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. Well, if a state is an eigenstate of Ay and A², then it's automatically an eigenstate of A². But since A² commutes with Ay, this is possible. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. I think this is also correct because any operator in 2x2 space has eigenvectors that form a basis.

But wait, the problem states that the operator is represented by a 2x2 matrix. So the eigenfunctions are vectors in that 2-dimensional space, hence they form the basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps multiple options might be correct, but the options are exclusive.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct because eigenvectors of Ay and A² can coexist, but not eigenvectors of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. That's also correct, because the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So which of the options is correct?

Looking back at the question, the options are mutually exclusive.

So let me reevaluate.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Which is correct?

Well, both statements are possibly correct. But wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form the basis for the operator's matrix representation.

Wait, but the matrix is already in a certain basis. So if you're considering the eigenfunctions as the basis functions, then yes, they form the basis.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct. Because the matrix is expressed in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors define a new basis.

Wait, no, the matrix is given in the standard basis, so the eigenvectors are functions in that basis. So the statement D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

But wait, wait. The square of the angular momentum operator A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². Because A² and Ay share eigenstates. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's automatically an eigenstate of A², so the statement in C is correct.

Wait, but how? Let me think. For angular momentum, [A², Ay] = 0. So if |ψ> is an eigenstate of Ay with eigenvalue a, then A² |ψ> = (A²) |ψ> = |ψ> multiplied by the eigenvalue of A², which is (ħ² s(s+1)), where s is the spin quantum number. So yes, the eigenstates of Ay are also eigenstates of A². Therefore, option C is correct.

So in that case, option C is correct.

But wait, the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, so s = 1/2. So A² would have eigenvalue ( (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ) * h²? Wait, but the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum, so perhaps A² has eigenvalues a(a+1) h², where a is 1/2 here.

Wait, but regardless, the point is that the eigenstates of Ay are also eigenstates of A². So option C is correct.

So among the options, option C is correct.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's a bit ambiguous. The basis functions of a matrix operator are generally the eigenvectors, because any operator can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis. So yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis, so D is correct.

Hmm, now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's check the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

That's correct because [A², Ay] =0, so they share eigenfunctions. But [Ay, Az] ≠ 0, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

I think this is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2x2 space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation, i.e., which is a correct statement about the process.

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statements are about the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C is about the eigenfunctions and their other eigen properties, while D is about the basis.

So which option is correct?

Let me think about the possible eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are incorrect because they either have imaginary parts or the wrong magnitudes.

So the correct options are C and D, but I need to pick the right one.

If I'm to choose between C and D, perhaps C is correct because the statement is about the eigenfunctions' properties, which is part of the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis.

Wait, but the operator is 2x2. The standard basis is the computational basis, but the eigenfunctions may form another basis. So D's statement is correct as the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator.

But the question is whether these are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the operator is represented in the standard basis, perhaps the eigenvectors are part of that basis. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the operator's matrix is in the given basis, perhaps the standard basis. The eigenvectors could be expressed in terms of that basis. So the statement in D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, perhaps the basis functions refer to the eigenvectors as the basis. So D would be correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So I'm getting a bit stuck between C and D. Let me try to think again.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, but Az doesn't.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's true because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space in which the operator acts.

So both C and D could be correct. But the options are in a multiple-choice format with only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps D is not correct because the eigenfunctions are not necessarily the basis functions of the operator. The basis of the operator's matrix is the standard basis (like the computational basis used to write the matrix). The eigenvectors form a different basis.

Wait, the matrix representation is given in a particular basis, say, the standard basis. The eigenvectors may not be aligned with that basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) may not form the basis in which the matrix is expressed. So in that case, D is incorrect.

Wait, no. The matrix is represented in a particular basis. The eigenvectors can be expressed in that basis, so they are functions (vectors) in that basis. So the eigenfunctions are elements of that basis. Hence, D would be correct.

Wait, perhaps D is correct. Because the matrix operator is expressed in a certain basis, and the eigenvectors are expressed in that same basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

But I'm still not entirely confident. Let me think about the problem again.

The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). The eigenfunctions are eigenvectors of Ay. Since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So the correct answer should be either C or D.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct. Because the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator.

Wait, but the basis of the operator is the same as the basis in which it is represented. The operator is represented in the standard basis, so the eigenfunctions are expressed in that basis. Thus, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think both C and D could be correct. But looking back at the original problem, which option is correct.

Wait, let me think about each option:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, correct. Because A² and Ay commute, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But Az and Ay don't commute, so they can't share eigenstates.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, this depends on the context. The basis functions of the matrix operator could refer to the set of vectors that make up the columns of the matrix, which would be the standard basis. But the eigenfunctions are different vectors, the eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the standard basis vectors unless the matrix is diagonal in that basis, which it isn't. So D is not correct.

Wait, but the matrix is given in the standard basis. The eigenvectors can be expressed in terms of that basis. So the eigenfunctions are vectors in that basis. Therefore, the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis in which the operator is represented.

Wait, but the standard basis is just one possible basis. The eigenvectors form another basis. So the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the operator matrix, unless the operator is diagonal in that basis.

So I'm getting a bit stuck on this. But considering that the eigenfunctions are vectors in the same space as the operator's matrix, which is represented in the standard basis, the eigenfunctions can be expressed as linear combinations of the standard basis vectors. So the statement in D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That would mean that the operator's matrix is diagonal in that basis, which is true because the eigenvectors form a basis where the operator is diagonal.

Wait, but the operator is given in the standard basis, so unless the eigenvectors are aligned with the standard basis, the matrix isn't diagonal. So in general, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a different basis from the standard basis.

So perhaps D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis functions.

Hence, I think option C is correct.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, which is represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The operator is given by \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix, with the form:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation \( A_y \phi = a \phi \) is to be solved, and the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are analyzed.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). However, \( A_y \) is a Hermitian operator, meaning its eigenvalues must be real. Thus, this option is incorrect because it suggests complex eigenvalues.

2. **Option B**: This option states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). Again, this is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real and calculated to be \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Option C**: This option asserts that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of the Z-component \( A_z \). Since \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This statement is correct.

4. **Option D**: This option claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the 2-dimensional space in which \( A_y \) acts, the matrix representation of \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis vectors unless \( A_y \) is diagonal in the standard basis, which it is not. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \). 

Answer: C
