--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule's transition between energy states. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The molecule is made of elements X and Y, modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state probably refers to the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So, the molecule is initially in its ground state, and a photon is absorbed, causing it to move to the next possible state. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think it's the first excited state, which is the next in the hierarchy of energy levels.

First, I need to understand what the energy levels look like in this model. The non-rigid rotor model considers both rotational and vibrational energies, right? But wait, I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized based on rotational quantum number. However, the non-rigid rotor would include some vibrational aspects as well. Or maybe it's a model that combines both rotation and vibration. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the model here is the vibration-rotation coupling, where the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational energies, and the photon's energy has to match the difference between these states.

But the question is about the momentum of the photon. The energy of a photon is related to its frequency by E = hν, where h is Planck's constant. But since momentum p is related to energy for photons by E = pc (since photons are massless), so p = E/c = hν/c. Or wait, actually, for photons, E = pc because their momentum is E/c. So yes, p = E/c.

So the key is to find the energy difference between the two states and then compute the photon's momentum.

But wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. For a diatomic molecule, the ground state is when both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their lowest. In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number (starts at 0, then 1, etc.). For the rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0.

In the vibration-rotation coupling, the vibrational state also comes into play. But I think the fundamental state in this context refers to the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the molecule is in n=0, J=0.

When it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next lowest state. The next state could be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1), or perhaps a combination. I need to figure out which transition is possible and what's the energy difference.

Wait, but for diatomic molecules, the selection rules for vibrational and rotational transitions are different. For vibrational transitions, the change in vibrational quantum number Δn is ±1. For rotational transitions, ΔJ can be ±1, and sometimes 0 depending on the vibration.

But in this problem, it's about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I'm a bit confused because the next state might be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Which one would have a lower energy than the other?

Wait, the energy of the vibrational state is much higher than the rotational states. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So for a given molecule, the vibrational energy quantum is much larger than the rotational ones. So the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) has energy (1/2) h w, and the next states would be n=1 (which would be higher) and J=1 (which would be lower or higher? Let me calculate).

Wait, let's compute the energies.

The rotational constant B is given by (h/(8 π² μ R²)) ), where μ is the reduced mass, and R is the bond length.

Given:
Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.
Angular freq w = 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but for the rotational energy, I think B is in terms of energy per unit J(J+1). Or perhaps it's in terms of w (angular frequency). Wait, I might need to compute B first.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) amu. Let's calculate that: 40 /22 = ~1.818 amu. Converting to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating μ:
1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (Approx 3 *1.66e-27) is 5e-27. Wait more accurately: 1.818 *1.6605 = approx 3.017, so 3.017e-27 kg.

Now, B is h/(8 π² μ R²). Let's compute B.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

Compute denominator first: 8 π² μ R².

8π² is about 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 *1.2068e-46 ≈ let's see, 78.9568 *1.2068 ≈ around 95.27, so 95.27e-46 = 9.527e-45.

So denominator is 9.527e-45.

So B = h / denominator = 6.626e-34 / 9.527e-45 ≈ (6.626 /9.527) *1e11.

6.626 /9.527 ≈ ~0.695. So B ≈ 0.695e11 = 6.95e10 1/s? Wait, units? Let me think. B has units of s^-1.

Wait, because B is h/(8 π² μ R²), which is [J s] / [kg m²]. Because h is J s, μ is kg, R is m, so denominator is kg m².

Yes, so B is h/(8 π² μ R²) in units of s^-1 (since J s / (kg m²) = (kg m²/s²) s) / (kg m²) )= (m²/s²) * (s) ) / m² = 1/s. So yes, B is in s^-1.

Wait, but alternatively, the rotational constant can also be given as (h/(8π² μ R²)) = ħ²/(2 μ R²) * something? Maybe I should double-check the formula. Oh well, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard formula for the rotational constant B is B = (h)/(8 π² μ R²), yes. So I think my calculation is correct.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / (8 π² μ R²) → which we approximated as 6.95e10 s^-1.

Wait, but wait, 6.626e-34 divided by 9.527e-45 is about (6.626 /9.527) * 1e11 → 0.695 * 1e11 → 6.95e10 s^-1.

So B is approximately 6.95e10 rad/s.

Wait, but the vibrational frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So that's much higher than B.

So, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), and vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w.

The ground state is n=0, J=0.

What's the next possible state? The next state with the lowest possible energy. Let's compute the energies of possible transitions.

Option 1: J=0 → J=1. The energy difference would be E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B.

Option 2: n=0 → n=1 (vibrational transition). The energy difference is (1 + 1/2) h w - (0 + 1/2) h w = h w.

So which transition requires less energy? Since w is 4e14 rad/s, which is way higher than B of ~7e10 rad/s.

So h w is h * 4e14 → while 2B is 2 * 6.95e10 → which is about 1.39e11.

h w is (6.626e-34 J s) * (4e14 s^-1) → 2.65e-19 J.

2B is 2 * (6.95e10) → 1.39e11 rad/s, but to get energy, we have to multiply by h?

Wait, no. The energy for rotation is E_rot = B J (J+1) in terms of frequency. Wait, actually, B is in s^{-1}, so E_rot = h B J (J+1). Because energy is h multiplied by the angular frequency.

Wait, no, wait. The rotational energy is E_rot = ħ² J (J+1) / (2 μ R²). Alternatively, E_rot = h c B J (J+1) / (something? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of energy. Let me compute E_rot for J=0 and J=1.

E_rot(J=0) = 0.

E_rot(J=1) = B *1*2 = 2B → but B is 6.95e10 s^{-1}, so E_rot = h * 2B.

Wait, no, E_rot is actually h * B * J (J+1). So E_rot = h B J (J+1).

Wait no, I think I may have messed up. Let me go back. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 μ R²). Because ħ is h/(2π), so E_rot can also be written as (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² μ R²).

Alternatively, another way to write it is E_rot = h B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in cm^-1 or s^{-1}.

Wait, but B is in s^{-1}, so E_rot = h * B * J (J+1). So for J=1, E_rot = h * B * 2.

So the energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = 2 h B.

Similarly, for the vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1, the energy difference is E_vib = h w (1 - 1/2) - (h w (0 + 1/2)) ) → wait, wait, no.

Wait, E_vib(n) = (n + 1/2) h w.

So when n=0 → (0 + 1/2) h w.
When n=1 → (1 + 1/2) h w.
The difference is (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w.

So the vibrational transition requires energy h w.

Now, which energy is smaller, 2 h B or h w?

We can compute 2 h B and compare with h w.

h w is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

2 h B is 2 * h * 6.95e10.

h is 6.626e-34, so 2 * 6.626e-34 * 6.95e10 = let's compute:

6.626e-34 *6.95e10 = approx 4.6e-23, multiplied by 2 is 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute it more precisely.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *6.95e10 = (6.626 *6.95) * 1e-34+10 = (46.0) *1e-24 = 4.6e-23 J.

So 2 h B is 2 *4.6e-23 = 9.2e-23 J.

Which is way larger than h w, which is 2.65e-19 J. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 9.2e-23 J is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because vibrational transitions usually require higher energy than rotational. Because vibrational energy levels are spaced much further apart than rotational ones. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate h w and 2 h B.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

2 h B: B is 6.95e10 s^{-1}, so h B is 6.626e-34 *6.95e10 ≈ 4.6e-23 J. Multiply by 2: 9.2e-23 J.

So 9.2e-23 J is less than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because I thought the vibrational transitions are higher energy than rotational. What did I do wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me re-calculate B.

B = h/(8 π² μ R²)

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

μ is (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg → μ = 1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Denominator: 8 π² μ R² =8 * (π^2) *3.017e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

Compute each part:

8 * π² ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈78.957.

3.017e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2068e-46 kg m².

Multiply by 78.957: 78.957 *1.2068e-46 ≈95.27e-46 =9.527e-45.

So denominator is 9.527e-45.

B = h / denominator =6.626e-34 /9.527e-45.

6.626e-34 /9.527e-45 → 6.626 /9.527 ≈0.695, times 1e11 (since 1e-34 /1e-45 =1e11).

So B ≈0.695e11 s^-1 → 6.95e10 s^-1.

So E_rot for J=1: E = h * B * J (J+1) = h *6.95e10 * 2 = 2 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10.

Compute 6.626e-34 *6.95e10:

6.626 *6.95 = approx 46.0 → 46.0e-24 → 4.6e-23 J.

Multiply by 2 →9.2e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires 9.2e-23 J.

The vibrational transition requires h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. That's way bigger than the rotational energy.

Wait, but that would mean that the rotational transition is lower in energy. So the molecule can absorb a photon that provides 9.2e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational photon.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is initially in the ground state (n=0, J=0). The next possible state with the lowest energy could be either a higher J (J=1) without changing n, or n=1 with J=0 (which would be a higher energy state). So between these two, which has lower energy.

Wait, n=1, J=0: E = (1 +1/2) h w + 0 (since J=0, E_rot=0). So E = (3/2) h w ≈ 3.975e-19 J.

If the molecule transitions to J=1, n=0: E_rot =9.2e-23 J, which is much lower than 3.975e-19 J.

So the next lowest state is J=1, n=0. So the molecule should absorb a photon that provides energy equal to the difference between J=1, n=0 and J=0, n=0.

So the energy of the photon is E_photon = E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the molecule could also transition to J=0, n=1, which would require more energy. So the photon with lower energy is what we're looking for.

So the energy of the photon is 9.2e-23 J. Since the photon's energy E = pc, then p = E/c.

Compute p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s).

9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s → but wait, wait, 9.2e-23 divided by 3e8 is approximately 3.07e-31.

But let's compute it properly.

9.2e-23 /3e8 = (9.2/3) *1e-31 → 3.0667e-31 kg m/s.

But wait, 9.2e-23 /3e8 = (9.2 /3) * 1e-23 /1e8 = 3.0667e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, they are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns range. So 3e-31 is way smaller than any of the options. Hmmm. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I got the model wrong. Since the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor), perhaps the energy levels are quantized differently, considering the vibrational and rotational aspects together.

Wait, another possibility is that the model is a rigid rotor with a vibration-rotation coupling. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is a combination of both.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the rigid rotor model, and the molecule can undergo a transition where both rotational and vibrational states change. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is being treated as a harmonic oscillator with rotational energy. So the total energy would be E = (n + 1/2) h w + B J (J+1).

Wait, but in that case, the transition could involve a change in J and n. But the selection rules would have to be considered.

But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, so n=0 and J=0. The next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy. So the next lowest state would be either J=1, n=0, or J=0, n=1.

As before, E for J=1, n=0 is 9.2e-23 J, and for J=0, n=1 is 3.975e-19 J. So the lower energy is 9.2e-23 J, so the photon should have that energy.

But the options given are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So 9.2e-23 J is way off. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is different. Maybe the molecule is treated as a non-rigid rotor, which includes the vibrational energy into the rotational model. So the moment of inertia isn't constant because of bond vibrations.

Wait, another approach: the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which might be considering the molecule as a particle in a rotating and vibrating state, but perhaps the energy levels are determined by the vibrational and rotational constants together.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies. So the photon must provide an energy that allows the molecule to go to the next state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

But in that case, I need to find the transition that requires the least energy. As we saw earlier, the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. So the photon's energy would be 9.2e-23 J, which in terms of momentum is p = E/c → 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But this is way smaller than the options given.

Hmm. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let's read the question again.

The question says, "the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?"

Wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0), and the next states are n=0, J=1; n=1, J=0; n=1, J=1, etc. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest energy increase. Which is J=1, n=0.

So the photon's energy is E = E_rot = h B (J=1)(J+1) - 0 → E = 2 h B.

Wait, so E_photon = 2 h B.

As before, 2 h B is 2 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10 = let's compute that.

6.626e-34 *6.95e10 = approx 4.6e-23 J. Multiply by 2 →9.2e-23 J.

So p = E/c →9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But the options are way larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recheck.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms → 2e-10 meters. R squared is 4e-20 m².

μ = (20 *2)/(22) amu =40/22 ≈1.818 amu =1.818 *1.66e-27 kg ≈3.017e-27 kg.

Denominator 8 π² μ R²: 8 * pi² is about 78.957.

78.957 * μ R² →78.957 *3.017e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

3.017e-27 *4e-20 =1.2068e-46 kg m².

Multiply by 78.957: 1.2068e-46 *78.957 ≈9.527e-45 kg m².

So B = h/(8 π² μ R²) =6.626e-34 /9.527e-45 ≈6.95e10 s^-1.

Wait, that's correct.

So the conclusion is that the photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s, but none of the options are that small. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the energy transition is not a pure rotational transition but a combination of vibrational and rotational.

Wait, maybe the photon's energy must account for both rotational and vibrational changes. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy required to go from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be a combination of both, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, where the energy levels are quantized, and the photon's energy is the vibrational energy.

Wait, but that would suggest the photon's energy is h w, which is 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Which is 2.65e-19 J, and p= E/c = 8.83e-30 kg m/s. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy in a different way. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy required to go from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which is n=1, but considering the rotational state is zero.

But that would require h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, but the options are all much larger.

Wait, the question states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model). So maybe the model is more complex, considering the bond length changes, and the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. So the bond length R isn't fixed as in the rigid rotor, but varies as the molecule vibrates, affecting the rotational energy.

In that case, perhaps the total energy is a combination of both, and the transition would involve both rotational and vibrational changes. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are considered as a combination, and the next state would be the first excited state overall, which is the next in energy, whether it's vibrational or rotational.

Wait, but the vibrational energy levels are much higher than rotational, so the first excited state would be the first vibrational state (n=1), with J=0, which would have higher energy than any rotational state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is being considered as a rigid rotor, which ignores vibration, but the question says non-rigid.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy required to go from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be either the first vibrational state (n=1, J=0) or the first rotational state (n=0, J=1). The one with lower energy is J=1.

So the energy difference is 2 h B.

But earlier, this energy was 9.2e-23 J, which is 9.2e-23 J. So p = E/c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I've made a mistake in units.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the problem is in the context of the non-rigid rotor model, which includes some vibration into the rotational energy. Or perhaps the model is such that the energy levels are E = (n + 1/2) h w_rot + ... I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the model is the Morse potential, which is a more accurate model for diatomic molecules, but that's beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy change from the ground state to the first excited state in the rotational spectrum, which would be a pure rotational transition.

But then the photon's energy is 2 h B, which is 9.2e-23 J, and the momentum p is 3e-31 kg m/s. But the options are way larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me re-calculate B.

B = h/(8 π² μ R²) → let me recompute:

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

8 π² ≈78.957.

μ =1.818 amu =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.017e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

R²=4e-20 m².

μ R²=3.017e-27 *4e-20 =1.2068e-46 kg m².

Multiply by 8 π²: 78.957 *1.2068e-46 ≈9.527e-45.

So B =6.626e-34 /9.527e-45 = approx 6.95e10 s^-1.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum, not the energy. But E = pc => p = E/(c). So if E is 9.2e-23 J, p is 3e-31 kg m/s. But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state, but considering that the rotational state changes as well. For example, the molecule could go from (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=0), which would require h w. But I thought that was higher than the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy required to break a bond, but that's not what the question is asking.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the given options.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

These are all on the order of 1e-28 to 1e-27 Ns. Let's compute the momentum p from E = h w and p = E/c.

If E_photon = h w, then p = h w /c.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s → approximately 8.83e-28 kg m/s → which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match exactly. Let me compute exactly:

6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is1.4e-28.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 isn't an option. So perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the difference between n=0, J=1 and n=0, J=0.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that E_rot is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is much smaller than any option. So perhaps the model is different.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy of the photon to cause a transition to the next vibrational state (n=1) and perhaps a change in rotational state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon causing a transition to the next state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one requiring the least energy.

So between the two possibilities, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which converts to p=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps the question is different. Maybe the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor, which would have the same approach as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the model, and the photon's energy is actually the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the first vibrational state (n=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). But that's the same as the ground state.

Wait, maybe the question is about the transition to the first excited state, which includes both a change in J and n. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is calculated using the vibrational and rotational constants together. Maybe the energy of the photon is the difference between the first rotational state and the first vibrational state.

But that would be E = 2 h B - h w. But since 2 h B is smaller than h w, this would result in a negative energy, which is impossible, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the ground state but the first excited state. But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the ground state.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should try looking for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the rotational spectrum. So the molecule absorbs a photon with energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

But earlier, that gives p=3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is not considering rotation but vibration.

Wait, in that case, the photon's energy is E = h w, so p = h w / c → (6.626e-34 *4e14) /3e8 = (2.65e-19) /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest would be option A:1.9e-28, but that's about a fifth of 8.8e-28. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute h w again more accurately.

h =6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value).

w =4e14 rad/s.

E_photon =6.62607015e-34 *4e14 =2.65042806e-19 J.

p = E/c →2.65042806e-19 /2.99792458e8 ≈8.837e-28 kg m/s.

Ah, so approximately 8.837e-28 kg·m/s, which is 8.837e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the question is not about a pure vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state, considering the rotational state as well.

Wait, perhaps the molecule's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies. So the next state would be the one with the minimal increase in energy, which could be either a higher rotational state or a higher vibrational state.

But as before, the rotational requires less energy, so the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 Ns. Still not matching the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state in the vibrational-rotational spectrum, which may involve a change in both n and J.

But this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure. Since the given options are much larger than the calculated momentum for the rotational transition, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition.

But then, the momentum would be about 8.8e-28 Ns. The closest option is A) 1.9e-28, but that's about a fifth. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the model is different, and the energy considered is the rotational energy plus some term. For example, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the moment of inertia depends on the vibrational state.

In that case, the rotational energy levels would depend on the vibrational state. But I'm not familiar with the exact treatment.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first excited rotational state (J=1) along with the first vibrational state (n=1), but that's going to a much higher energy.

Another possibility is that the question is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, and the photon's energy is h w, leading to a momentum p = h w / c = 8.8e-28 kg m/s. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p. Let me compute p again.

p = E_photon / c.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

c =3e8 m/s.

p =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.8347e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → about 22% of 8.8e-28.

So it's not matching, but perhaps I made a mistake in the question's parameters.

Wait, let me check the given parameters again.

The bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Hmm, but in the rotational constant formula, R is in meters. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the rotational constant in terms of cm^-1, not s^-1. Let me think about that.

Rotational constant B can be expressed in cm^-1 as:

B (cm^-1) = h / (8 π² μ c R²) → because c is speed of light in cm/s.

Wait, that might be another way to express B. Let me compute B in cm^-1.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. The rotational constant in wavenumbers (cm^-1) is given by:

B̃ = h/(8 π² μ c R²)

Where c is speed of light in cm/s.

Let me compute that:

h=6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e10 cm/s.

μ=3.017e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m =2e-8 cm.

R²=4e-16 cm².

So B̃ = (6.626e-34) / (8 π² *3.017e-27 kg *3e10 cm/s *4e-16 cm² )

Wait, let's compute denominator:

8 π² ≈78.957.

78.957 *3.017e-27 ≈2.38e-25.

Multiply by 3e10 →6.34e-15.

Multiply by 4e-16 →2.536e-30.

So denominator is 2.536e-30.

So B̃ =6.626e-34 /2.536e-30 → approximately 2.61e-4 cm^-1.

So B̃ ≈2.61e-4 cm^-1.

But I'm not sure how this helps. Because in terms of energy, E_rot in cm^-1 would be B̃ J (J+1) × h c.

Wait, E_rot = B̃ J(J+1) × h c.

But I'm not sure if this approach leads to a different result. Let me compute E_rot for J=1.

E_rot = B̃ *2 * h c.

B̃ =2.61e-4 cm^-1.

h c =12400 eV·Å → but perhaps in Joules, h c = 1.986e-25 J.

So E_rot = 2.61e-4 *2 *1.986e-25 →≈1.03e-24 J.

Wait, but this is much smaller than the earlier 9.2e-23 J. So perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

The problem asks for the momentum of the photon. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Assuming that the correct approach is to compute p = h w /c, which gives 8.83e-28 Ns. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the rotational momentum.

Earlier, E_rot for J=1 is 9.2e-23 J → p=3.07e-31 Ns. But again, no option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. But I'm not sure.

Another possibility: Maybe the molecule is in the first rotational state (J=1) and first vibrational state (n=1), and the transition is from J=0, n=0 to J=1, n=1.

But the energy would be E = [ (n=1 +1/2) h w ] + [ h B (1)(2) ] - [ (n=0 +1/2) h w ] - [0 ].

That would be E = h w + 2 h B.

But that would be 2.65e-19 +9.2e-23 ≈2.65e-19 J. So p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is the same as the vibrational transition.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the first vibrational and first rotational energies. But that's more than either transition alone.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is transitioning to a state where both J and n increase, but that requires more energy.

I'm not making progress. Let me think, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the energy of the photon as the vibrational energy, which gives p=8.8e-28 Ns. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_photon. Let me compute precisely.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 →6.626 *4 =26.504, so 26.504e-20 →2.6504e-19 J.

p= E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 →8.8347e-28 kg m/s →8.8347e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the photon's energy as the rotational energy, not the vibrational.

So p=3.07e-31 Ns is way too small.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies. But that would be even larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require more energy, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited state (n=0, J=1), which requires energy 2 h B.

So E_photon =2 h B =2 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10 = let's compute.

6.626e-34 *6.95e10 =4.6e-23 J.

Multiply by 2 →9.2e-23 J.

p =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 Ns.

But this is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy as part of the vibrational state, leading to an effective energy that's a combination.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy as the main factor, leading to the photon's momentum being 3.07e-31 Ns, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass in a different way. Let me recompute the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 *2 ) / (22) amu =40/22 =1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to select the option closest to the calculated value. But none are close. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the translational energy, but that doesn't make sense because it's about rotation and vibration.

Another possibility: perhaps the energy difference is not for a pure rotational or vibrational transition but a combination. But I don't know the exact method.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule's vibrational energy as the main factor because the rotation is negligible. But in that case, the photon's momentum would be 8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, let me look at the options again. They're all around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. My vibrational calculation gave 8.8e-28 Ns, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly. Option D is1.4e-28, which is about half. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the given bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. But perhaps the formula for B uses R in a different unit. Wait, no, I used it in meters correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the photon's energy causing the molecule to transition to the next state in the vibrational spectrum, which is n=1, but with J=0. So E_photon = h w.

But the calculation gives p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1.9e-28 Ns. But why is it half?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the J=1 state, and the next state is J=2. But that would require more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rotational energy as the only factor, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Given that the vibrational approach gives a p of approximately 8.8e-28, which is not an option, the next possibility is that the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, which is about 1.25 times larger than the calculated value, but perhaps due to different constants used.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the vibrational energy but uses a different value for c as 3e8 m/s, but I used that already.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed of light as approximately 3e8 m/s, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the energy in terms of wavelength, but I don't think that applies here.

After all this, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the photon's energy as the vibrational energy. So the correct momentum is approximately 8.8e-28 Ns. But since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A)1.9e-28 Ns.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the rotational transition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the momentum for each option and see which one gives an energy that matches either the vibrational or rotational energy.

Option A: p=1.9e-28 kg m/s.

E_photon =p*c =1.9e-28 *3e8 =5.7e-20 J.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J. So 5.7e-20 is less than that. So doesn't match.

Option B: p=2.3e-27 → E=2.3e-27 *3e8=6.9e-20 J.

Which is larger than h w (2.65e-19 J). No.

Option C: p=1.1e-27 →E=1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-19 J.

Which is about 1.25 times h w. Doesn't match.

Option D: p=1.4e-28 →E=1.4e-28 *3e8=4.2e-20 J. Less than h w.

Hmm, not matching.

So perhaps none of the options are correct, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the vibration-rotation spectrum, which is a combination of rotational and vibrational changes. For example, from (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=1). But that would require a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require more energy.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to proceed with the best guess. The only option somewhat close to my calculation for the rotational transition is option D)1.4e-28, but that's much smaller. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the rotational energy.

Wait, B =6.95e10 s^-1.

E_rot for J=1 is 2 h B =2*6.626e-34 *6.95e10 =9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies.

E_photon =h w + 2 h B →2.65e-19 +9.2e-23 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.8e-28 Ns.

Still, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the difference between J=0 and J=1, but in a different model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy as part of the vibrational state, which I'm not familiar with.

Given that I'm not making progress, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is the one corresponding to the vibrational transition, which is approximately 8.8e-28 Ns, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A)1.9e-28 Ns, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator and the photon's energy is the difference between the first and second vibrational states. But that would require E= h w.

Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state with J=1, but that complicates things.

I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is initially in its fundamental state (n=0, J=0), and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The key parameters provided are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels**:
   - The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = h B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2} \) is the rotational constant.
   - The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{vib}} = (n + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega \).

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant**:
   The rotational constant \( B \) is calculated as:
   \[
   B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2}.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   B = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2} \approx 6.95 \times 10^{10} \, \text{s}^{-1}.
   \]

4. **Energy of Transitions**:
   - **Rotational Transition**: From \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) - E_{\text{rot}}(J=0) = 2 h B.
     \]
     Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s} \) and \( B = 6.95 \times 10^{10} \, \text{s}^{-1} \):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2 \cdot 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 6.95 \times 10^{10} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - **Vibrational Transition**: From \( n=0 \) to \( n=1 \), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega.
     \]
     Substituting \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   The calculated momentum for the vibrational transition (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)) is closest to the options provided. However, none of the options match exactly. The closest option is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)**, which is approximately one-fifth of the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either a miscalculation or an issue with the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the most reasonable choice based on the vibrational transition is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)**, though it does not perfectly match the calculated value.

**Answer: A**
