Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected them, and the shift in the spectral lines is given for each.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravity. The formula I think is something like V = (G * (M_p) / (4 * π² * a)) )^(something? No, maybe I should think about the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter.

Oh right, the RV method gives the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P) )^(1/3) ) )^(something... Wait, maybe it's better to think about the formula that connects the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) with the orbital period (P) and the mass of the planet.

Wait, I think the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) ) but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term goes away.

But wait, M_p is much smaller than M_star (since Neptune's mass is about 1/7th Earth, and Earth is 1/333,000th of the Sun's mass). So M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So we can approximate the formula.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) )

But since M_p is negligible, the (1+...) term is about 1, so we can ignore it.

So K = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ) * (1/ (1 AU)^(2/3) )? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the formula might be:

K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But again, M_p is much smaller, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but since both planets are detected, and their orbital periods are what we're comparing, and the stars are identical, perhaps sin i is similar? Well, the problem doesn't mention inclination, so I think we can assume that the inclination is the same for both, so the sin i term cancels out when taking the ratio.

Wait, but the RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination (sin i), and the orbital period. But since we're comparing two planets, and the stars are the same, perhaps we can set up a ratio.

Let me define:

K1 = velocity semi-amplitude for planet 1.

K2 = velocity semi-amplitude for planet 2.

We know K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7.

Wait, but wait, milliangstrom is a unit of wavelength shift. To get velocity, we need to convert that. Oh, right, the Doppler shift in wavelength relates to velocity via the formula:

v = c * (Δλ / λ_0)

Where c is the speed of light, and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.

But for the same spectral line, λ_0 is the same for both stars. So if we take the ratio of the velocities, the λ_0 cancels out.

So, let me denote v1 = K1 = 5e-3 Å / λ_0 * c.

v2 = K2 = 7e-3 Å / λ_0 * c.

So the ratio v2 / v1 = (7 / 5) = 1.4.

So v2 = 1.4 * v1.

But from the RV formula, the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, because K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Wait, let me be precise. From the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) ), assuming M_p << M_star.

But since both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), M_p is same for both. So the ratio of K's becomes:

K2 / K1 = [ (1 / P2^(1/3)) ] / [ (1 / P1^(1/3)) ] )

Which would be (P1 / P2 )^(1/3).

Wait, no, let me re-express that.

K1 = (constant) * M_p^(1/3) * (1 / (M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = same constant * M_p^(1/3) * (1 / M_star^(1/3) ) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_star are same for both, the ratio K2/K1 becomes (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3) ) ) = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

But we know that K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So, 1.4 = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (1.4)^3 = P1 / P2

Calculate 1.4^3:

1.4 * 1.4 is 1.96, 1.96 * 1.4= 2.744.

So 2.744 = P1 / P2 → P2 = P1 / 2.744

So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 / P1 = 1/2.744 ≈ 0.365.

Hmm, that's option A: ~0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup.

I think I mixed up K2 and K1 in the ratio. Let me re-express.

The velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the period to the 1/3.

So larger velocity corresponds to shorter period, because if the star is moving faster, the planet must be orbiting more quickly to maintain the balance.

So K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)) → K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

So P ∝ 1/K^(3).

Wait, so the ratio of periods would be inversely proportional to the cube of the ratio of K.

Let me restate:

v1 = K1 = 5 milliangstrom → velocity is proportional to shift, so v1 = 5, v2=7.

v1 = c * (Δλ1 / λ0 )

v2 = c * (Δλ2 / λ0 )

So v2/v1 = 7/5.

But from the RV formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*)^(1/3) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_* are same for both, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So, K2/K1 = (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

So,

K2/K1 = (7/5) = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides:

343/125 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (125/343)

125 is 5^3, 343 is 7^3.

So 125/343 = (5/7)^3.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the cube.

Wait, K2/K1 = 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So (7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → P1 = P2 * (7/5)^3.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

So (5/7)^3 is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Wait, that can't be right because 0.364 is less than 1.

Wait, wait, no. Because if K is higher, the velocity semi-amplitude is higher, which means the period is shorter.

So if K2 is bigger than K1, P2 must be smaller than P1.

But the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1.

So P2 is shorter than P1. So P2 = 0.364 * P1 → P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So how many times longer is it? It's shorter, so the answer would be 0.36 times as long, meaning it's 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times longer than planet #1. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait a second, perhaps I confused P1 and P2.

Let me restate:

We have (K2/K1) = (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So,

(7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → P1 = P2 * (7/5)^3.

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 ≈ P1 * (125/343) ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, but the question is how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's.

Wait, that's not possible, because it's shorter. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, maybe I should restate the ratio correctly.

We have K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So P ∝ 1/K^3.

So, for planet #1, P1 is proportional to 1/K1^3.

For planet #2, P2 is proportional to 1/K2^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1^3)/(K2^3) ) → (5/7)^3.

Because P2 is proportional to 1/K2^3, and P1 is 1/K1^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter.

Wait, but the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1?

So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is 0.364 times as long as P1. So it's not longer; it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer? So the answer would be about 0.36 times as long, which is less than one, so the period is shorter.

But the options are all positive numbers. So option A is ~0.36. So the correct answer would be option A, because the period of planet #2 is ~0.36 times as long as planet #1, meaning planet #2's period is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long, so it's 0.36 times longer, but since it's less than 1, it's actually shorter.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the period of P2 is longer by a factor of X compared to P1. So if P2 is longer, X>1.

But according to our calculation, P2 is shorter than P1. So in that case, the answer would be 0.36 times as long. So the period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1, meaning it's shorter.

But the options are presented as how many times longer. So 0.36 times longer, which is the same as 36% of the length of P1, so it's shorter.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased is: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times longer. So the answer is option A, ~0.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me just recheck my RV formula.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ (something) ) Wait, perhaps I should find the exact formula.

The correct formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * ( (2π/P) )^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But for circular orbits, e=0, and since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i ) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * ( (2π/P) )^(1/3) ) )

Which can be rewritten as:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) * (P)^( -1/3 ) )

Which leads to:

K ∝ (1/P^(1/3) )

So for the same M_p and M_*, and same sin i (since both are RV detected, so sin i is close to 90 degrees, same for both), K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So the ratio of K's is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of periods.

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

Which is what I had before.

So K2/K1 =7/5= (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides: 343/125 = P1/P2 → P2= P1 * (125/343) ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times the period of planet #1. So it's shorter.

So how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? It's 0.364 times longer. So the answer would be option A, ~0.36.

But wait, the question asks how many times longer, so if planet #2's period is 0.36 times planet #1's, that means it's shorter, not longer. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but I might have made a mistake in the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up P1 and P2 in the ratio.

Wait, let's take a different approach. Let's write the formula for each planet.

For planet #1:

K1 = (constant) * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

For planet #2:

K2 = (constant) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

Dividing the two equations:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

So (7/5) = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides: (343/125) = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (125/343) ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So P2 is shorter than P1. So planet #2 has a shorter orbital period.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's less than one, so 0.36 times longer. So the answer is option A.


The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes. Both planets orbit stars with identical masses, and the RV method detects the Doppler shift caused by the star's motion due to the planet's gravitational pull. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), as described by the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is related to the ratio of their orbital periods by:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
1.4 = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
(1.4)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
2.744 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

Rearranging for \( P_2 \):

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{1}{2.744} \approx P_1 \cdot 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.364 \) times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is \( 0.36 \), as \( P_2 \) is shorter than \( P_1 \).
