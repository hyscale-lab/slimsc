Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as:

L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, so the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson X and fermions. Hmm. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay channels.

Okay, so I need to think about what particles the boson X can decay into. Since X is a boson, its decay products should be fermions because the interaction term involves fermions.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is proportional to X(y) multiplied by the fermion fields. So the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ_f. The fermions involved are the ones that have this term, so I guess the possible decay products are the same as the fermions ψ_f.

Wait, but wait. The term is (v + X(y)), so the interaction is with the field X. So when X decays, it would decay into a pair of fermions ψ_f and their anti-particles. So the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs.

So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that's allowed by the interaction term. But what fermions are present here? The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which probably stands for all the fermions in the Standard Model, unless specified otherwise. But wait, looking at the options, the decay products are particles like b, s, u, d, c, tau, etc., which are quarks and leptons.

But wait, let me think again. The mass of X is 6 GeV. The decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So for each possible fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products (for non-relativistic or zero momentum cases; but usually, the condition is that the parent's mass is greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion, since each fermion will have a rest mass, and you need two of them).

Wait, but wait: fermions come in generations, like quarks and leptons. For each, their masses vary. Let me list the known fermion masses.

Quarks:

up (u): around 2.2 MeV
down (d): ~4.7 MeV
strange (s): ~95 MeV
charm (c): ~1.3 GeV
bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
top (t): ~173 GeV

Leptons:

electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it can produce a pair of any fermions where 2 * m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

But wait, wait. Because for a boson to decay into two particles, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. But in reality, since the decay products can have some kinetic energy, the condition is that the rest mass of the boson should be greater than or equal to twice the rest mass of each decay product. Because each particle must have at least its rest mass.

Wait no, because for two identical particles, each would have a rest mass m, so 2m ≤ M, where M is the mass of the decaying particle.

So for each fermion f, we check if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

So let's list each possible fermion and see if 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

Electron (e): m = 0.511 MeV. 2m = 1.022 MeV << 6 GeV, so yes.
Muon (mu): m=105.7 MeV. 2*105.7=211.4 MeV <<6 GeV. Yes.
Tau (tau): m=1.78 GeV. 2m=3.56 GeV <6 GeV. So yes.
Up (u): m=2.2 MeV. 2m=4.4 MeV. Yes.
Down (d): m=4.7 MeV. 2m=9.4 MeV. Yes.
Strange (s): m=95 MeV. 2m=190 MeV. Yes.
Charm (c): m=1.3 GeV. 2m=2.6 GeV <6 GeV. Yes.
Bottom (b): m=4.7 GeV. 2m=9.4 GeV >6 GeV. So no, can't decay into b b-bar.
Top (t): m=173 GeV. Way above, so no.

So possible fermions that can be decay products are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So possible decay channels are:

e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau-
u u-bar
d d-bar
s s-bar
c c-bar.

But wait, the interaction term is written as (v + X(y)) multiplied by ψ_f and bar{ψ}_f. So the interaction is proportional to X ψ_f bar{ψ}_f. So the vertex would be X coupling to a fermion-antifermion pair.

So for each fermion f, if the Lagrangian allows interaction with X, then X can decay into f and f-bar.

But wait, the given Lagrangian is:

L = - λ f bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, perhaps the way it's written is a bit confusing. Let me parse it. The term is (v + X(y)), which is a scalar (since X is a boson field, presumably a scalar here). So the interaction term is X ψ ψ.

So the interaction is X coupling to ψ_f and ψ_f-bar, meaning that the vertex is X to two fermions (a fermion and antifermion pair).

So, the possible decay products are any fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

From the earlier analysis, that includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the possible decay options are:

X → e+ e-
X → mu+ mu-
X → tau+ tau-
X → u u-bar
X → d d-bar
X → s s-bar
X → c c-bar

Now let's look at the answer options.

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

Wait, but earlier we saw that for b, 2m ~9.4 GeV >6 GeV, so b is excluded. So A includes b which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All are allowed. But what about the charm quark? 2m_c=2.6 GeV ≤6 GeV, so yes, allowed.

Option C: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, top quark is in option C. But 2m_t is about 346 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV. So t is not allowed. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, b is included, which is not allowed because 2m_b=9.4 GeV >6 GeV. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option must be B, which includes all the allowed fermions except for b and t.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Yes, that's all the allowed ones. So the answer is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

From the interaction term, it is clear that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f\bar{f} \)) if the combined rest mass of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV, so the condition for allowed decays is:

\[
2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV},
\]

where \( m_f \) is the rest mass of the fermion \( f \). The masses of Standard Model fermions are as follows:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

Using the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the allowed fermions are:

- \( e \), \( \mu \), \( \tau \), \( u \), \( d \), \( s \), and \( c \).

The corresponding decay channels are:

\[
X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u\bar{u}, \, d\bar{d}, \, s\bar{s}, \, c\bar{c}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. This is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in A. Hence, D is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
