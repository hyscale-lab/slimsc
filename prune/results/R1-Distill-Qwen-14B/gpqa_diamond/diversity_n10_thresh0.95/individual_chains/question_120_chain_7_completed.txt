Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So that probably means their density doesn't change with distance, right? Wait, but wait. Parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax p is 1 over distance d, so d = 1/p. Oh right, because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax range. So we're looking at how the density of stars changes with respect to parallax intervals. I think I remember that the number of stars you can see in a given range depends on the volume, but how does that relate to parallax?

Let me break it down. Let's say we have a range of parallax from p to p + dp. Each star's distance is d = 1/p. So a small change in p would correspond to a change in distance. Wait, how exactly?

Parallax p is in arcseconds. The distance in parsecs is d = 1/p. So if I consider a small change in p, like from p to p + dp, the corresponding distances are d = 1/p and d + dd = 1/(p + dp). But wait, when p is small, because for most stars, p is less than 1, like in our galaxy. So if p increases by dp, what's the change in distance? Let me compute dd.

Let me think, dd = derivative of 1/p with respect to p. So d = 1/p → dd/dp = -1/p². So dd = - dp/(p²). But since p is positive, and dp is positive (we're looking at a small increase in p), dd is negative. That means as p increases, distance decreases. So the distance interval corresponding to a parallax interval dp is about (1/p) - (1/(p+dp)) ≈ (1/p) - (1/p - 1/p² * dp) ) → 1/p² dp. Wait, wait, exact calculation: 1/p - 1/(p + dp) = [ (p+dp) - p ] / [p(p+dp)] ) = dp/(p(p+dp)) ≈ dp/(p^2) because dp is small compared to p. So the change in distance is approximately (1/p^2) dp.

But wait, the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is area (4π d²) multiplied by thickness dd. So substituting dd from above, which is (1/p²) dp, so the volume is 4π ( (1/p) )² * (1/p²) dp )? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, d = 1/p, so d² is 1/p². And dd is approx 1/p² dp. So volume is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, if the stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density is constant. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV, where n is the number per unit volume. So the number of stars in a parallax interval dp would be n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So as p increases, how does the number of stars per unit dp change? So the number per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number density of stars in terms of parallax would be inversely proportional to p^4.

Alternatively, the number of stars per unit of parallax (per parsec of parallax? Wait, no, parallax is in arcseconds, so it's per unit of p, which is in arcseconds. So the number of stars in a small interval dp around p is proportional to the volume, which as we found is (1/p^4) dp. So the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

So looking at the options, A is 1/p^4, B is 1/p², C is 1/p, D is 1/p^3. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I missed a step. The question says "the number of stars per unit range of parallax". So that's stars per (unit of p). So the number per dp is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit dp is 4π n / p^4. So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. So that's option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the transformation again. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density is uniform. So in terms of distance, the number of stars in a shell between d and d+dd is 4π d² dd multiplied by n. But since d = 1/p, we can write this as 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p² dp) ) * n. So that's 4π n (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit dp is 4π n / p^4. Thus, the number density per unit parallax is inversely proportional to p^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of probability. The probability of finding a star in a certain range of parallax. So the cumulative distribution function for stars as a function of parallax. The number of stars with parallax less than p is the integral of the number per unit p from 0 to p. But that's about the cumulative, not the per-unit.

So yeah, I think the conclusion is that the number per unit parallax is ~1/p^4, so option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax \( p \) is inversely related to distance \( d \), such that \( d = 1/p \). A small change in parallax \( dp \) corresponds to a small change in distance \( dd \), which can be approximated as \( dd \approx -1/p^2 \, dp \). The negative sign indicates that as \( p \) increases, \( d \) decreases.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd \approx 1/p^2 \, dp \), the volume becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) dp = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume itself. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \), which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
