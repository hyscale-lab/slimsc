Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Alright, the question is about the decay of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. They provided a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between the bosonic field X and some fermions.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my notation, but I think that represents the interaction term. So, the boson X is interacting with fermions of type f. The lambda (λ) is the coupling constant, I suppose.

The question is asking about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out what particles X can decay into. Since X is a boson, in lowest order processes, it would decay into pairs of particles. Typically, a boson like a scalar or vector would decay into a pair of fermions. But wait, wait. Wait, the term in the Lagrangian is λ f \bar{ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. That looks a bit like a Yukawa interaction, right? Because the Yukawa interaction couples a scalar (like the Higgs) to fermions.

In the Yukawa Lagrangian, usually you have a term like g φ ψ ψ, where φ is a scalar field, and ψ are fermions. So in this case, our X is the scalar field, and the interaction is with fermion fields. So, the decay of X would be into two fermions, right? Because in the Lagrangian, the interaction is with two fermions. So, X can decay into a pair of fermions.

But wait, I'm not sure if X is a scalar or a vector boson. The problem says it's a bosonic field, but doesn't specify. Oh, but the interaction is with fermions in a Yukawa-like term, which usually happens with scalars. So perhaps X is a scalar boson, like the Higgs. So, when X decays, it would produce two fermions.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So, the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Fermions come in different generations, each with their own masses. Let's think about the masses of the fermions.

The fermions available are quarks and leptons. The up and down quarks are the lightest, but they are confined inside hadrons, so for decays into quarks, you might have to consider that. Wait, but in the Standard Model, can a scalar decay into quarks directly?

Well, in the Standard Model, the Higgs can decay into any fermions, but the decay width is proportional to the mass of the fermion. But in the case of quarks, the decay would be into a pair of quarks, but since they are confined, perhaps the dominant decays are into the heavier quarks which are more likely to be observed. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, but the problem is about kinematically allowed decays. So, the mass of X (6 GeV) must be larger than the sum of the masses of the two fermions it's decaying into. Because in a decay, the rest mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products (for each possible pair).

So, I should list all possible fermion pairs that have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions. For quarks, the masses are (approximate):

- Up quark: ~2 MeV
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark: ~173 GeV

Leptons:

- Electron: ~0.511 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV

So, considering that, let's see what pairs are possible.

For each fermion f, the decay X → f f̄ would require 2 m_f ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV.

So let's go through each possible fermion:

1. Electron (e⁻): 0.511 MeV. So pair would be 2 * 0.511 ≈ 1.022 MeV. That's way less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into e⁺ e⁻.

2. Muon (μ⁻): ~105.7 MeV. So pair: ~211.4 MeV. Also way less than 6 GeV. So X → μ⁺ μ⁻ is allowed.

3. Tau (τ⁻): ~1.78 GeV. Pair: ~3.56 GeV. 3.56 < 6, so allowed. X → τ⁺ τ⁻.

4. Up quark (u): ~2 MeV. Pair: ~4 MeV. Allowed. So X → u ū.

5. Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV. Pair: ~8-10 MeV. Allowed. X → d d̄.

6. Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV. Pair: ~200 MeV. Allowed. X → s s̄.

7. Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV. Pair: ~3 GeV. 3 < 6, allowed. X → c c̄.

8. Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV. Pair: ~9 GeV. 9 >6, so not allowed. So X cannot decay into b b̄.

9. Top quark (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV. So even a single top quark is heavier than X, so decay into t t̄ is impossible.

So, possible fermions for decay are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but what about the other leptons? Like, neutrinos? But neutrinos have very small masses (almost zero, treated as zero in many cases). So for neutrinos, 2 m_ν is ≈0. So X can decay into ν ν̄ as well? But in the given Lagrangian, are the interactions with neutrinos present?

Wait, the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So, does the Lagrangian include all possible fermions, or only some?

Looking at the Lagrangian: the interaction is written as λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, the index f here is for each fermion species. It doesn't specify whether f includes neutrinos or not. But in the Standard Model, the Higgs (v is the vacuum expectation value, so perhaps v is the Higgs VEV) couples to all fermions, including neutrinos. However, in practice, neutrinos are very light, but if they have any mass, then decays into neutrinos would be possible.

Wait, but the problem says "fermions," which usually include all leptons and quarks. So, if the interaction includes all fermions, then X could decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass condition is satisfied.

But in the options provided, I don't see any neutrino decay channels. Let me check the options again.

Options A) includes b, s, u, d, tau, e.

Option B) includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option D) has b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, so for each option, let's see which fermions are included.

The possible fermions that can be decay products are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Because b is 4.5 GeV, so pair is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X cannot decay into b or t.

So, the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the possible decay channels are X → e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, so looking at the options:

Option A: X → b, s, u, d, tau, e. But wait, including b would require 2*4.5 =9 GeV >6, so option A is wrong.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all the allowed ones except for bottom and top. So that's correct.

Wait, but option B says "c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e." Which are all the allowed fermions except b and t. So option B would have all possible decay channels except for b and t.

But wait, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays. So the correct answer should include all possible fermions where 2 m_f ≤6 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are c (since 2*1.5=3 ≤6), s (2*0.1=0.2, wait no, s is about 100 MeV, so 2*100 is 200 MeV. So yes, allowed). u, d are allowed. e, mu, tau are allowed.

So the decay channels are into c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So the correct option would have all these.

Looking at the options:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that includes all except for b and t. So option B is correct.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? If X's mass is 6 GeV, and the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, then each b quark is 4.5, so two of them would be 9 GeV. So 9 >6. So decay into b and anti-b is not allowed. So B is correct.

But let me check the options again.

Option C: X → c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. Wait, that includes t, which is 173 GeV each. So pair would require 346 GeV, which is way too big. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, so D is wrong.

So the correct options would be the ones that include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options, only option B and perhaps another.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b bar b, s, u, d, tau, e—so includes b, which is not allowed.

Option B: X→ c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e — all allowed.

Option D: X→ b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e — includes b, which is not allowed.

So, the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The interaction term resembles a Yukawa coupling, where \( X \) decays into fermion-antifermion pairs. To determine the allowed decays, the combined mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses (Approximate)
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Analysis of Decay Channels
1. **Electron (\( e^+ e^- \))**: \( 2m_e = 1.022 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
2. **Muon (\( \mu^+ \mu^- \))**: \( 2m_\mu = 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
3. **Tau (\( \tau^+ \tau^- \))**: \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
4. **Up quark (\( u \bar{u} \))**: \( 2m_u = 4 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
5. **Down quark (\( d \bar{d} \))**: \( 2m_d = 8-10 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
6. **Strange quark (\( s \bar{s} \))**: \( 2m_s = 200 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
7. **Charm quark (\( c \bar{c} \))**: \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \bar{b} \))**: \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (exceeds 6 GeV).
9. **Top quark (\( t \bar{t} \))**: \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (far exceeds 6 GeV).

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \).

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
