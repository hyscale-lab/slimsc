--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in terms of meters, so I guess I'm supposed to calculate the average distance the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * τ * β, where β is the velocity over the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime. Right?

But how do I find β and τ from the given parameters? Let me think. The proper lifetime τ is related to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. I think the relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but units matter here. Γ is given in MeV, and I need to convert that into energy units compatible with ħ.

Wait, ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Let me recall. Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So yes, Γ in GeV would give me τ in seconds when I do ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, the width is given in MeV. Oh right, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging the numbers in: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, let me calculate that again. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s? Or wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s. That seems right.

Next, I need β, which is the velocity of the meson divided by c. How to find β? Well, I can use relativistic energy equations. The energy E of the meson is given as 8 GeV. Since E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but the mass m is given as 1.2 GeV/c². So E is 8 GeV.

So γ = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.66667. So γ is approximately 6.6667.

But I need β. I remember that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let's compute that.

So β = sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667)^2)).

Calculating 6.6667 squared: 6.6667 is 20/3, so (20/3)^2 is 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/(44.4444) is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Take the square root: sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887, which is about 0.989. Close to the speed of light, which makes sense since the energy is much higher than the rest mass.

Now, putting it all together. The mean decay distance is c * τ * β.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So let me compute each part.

First, c * τ: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then multiply by β, which is approximately 0.9887. So 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.104e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are exactly 6e-16. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of τ. Let me recheck the numbers. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Yes, that gives τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Hmm, but perhaps I should consider the total decay width and the relation to the lifetime. Wait, another thought: the relation τ = ħ/(Γ) is correct, yes? Because the width Γ is the total decay rate, and the uncertainty in energy is Γ, so the uncertainty in time is ħ/(Γ).

Alternatively, sometimes people use Γ as the total width, so that's correct. So the τ calculation is right.

Wait, but perhaps the production energy is not the same as the center-of-mass energy, but in this case, I think the approach is correct because the problem states production energy E_X is 8 GeV, which would be the energy of the meson.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the meson is moving relativistically, so the decay length is calculated using its gamma factor and beta.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately. Let me compute 1/(6.66667)^2 exactly.

6.66667 squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444444. So 1/(44.4444444) = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately. Let's see, 0.9887 squared is about (0.9887)^2 = 0.9775 (yes). So that's correct.

So c * τ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. Multiply by beta ≈ 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.104e-16 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16, which is about 5e-16. Option D is 4.0655e-16. Neither is close to my 6e-16. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma.

E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV. γ = E/(m c²) → but wait, E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

That's correct. So beta is as I calculated.

Hmm... perhaps I should consider the decay width in MeV instead of GeV earlier. Wait, no, I converted it to GeV correctly. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of c*τ*beta. Let me recompute.

c = 3e8 m/s.

τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

c * τ = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

3 * 2.056875 is 6.170625, so 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta ≈ 0.9887:

6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.104e-16 m.

Wait, but none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the mean lifetime as τ, but perhaps the actual formula is different. Oh wait, another thought: the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider relativistic effects for the decay width. No, I think the approach is correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the momentum is not the same as the energy, but perhaps I should compute the velocity differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity using the relativistic momentum.

Wait, let's think about the energy. The total energy E is 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E - m c² = 8 - 1.2 = 6.8 GeV.

But perhaps using E = gamma m c² is better.

So gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.66667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) as before.

Hmm, I'm back where I started.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of beta is the issue. Let me compute it more precisely.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666667.

gamma_squared = (8/1.2)^2 = (64/1.44) ≈ 44.4444444.

1/gamma_squared = 0.0225.

1 - 1/gamma_squared = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, but let's compute it more accurately.

Let me calculate 0.9887 squared: 0.9887 * 0.9887.

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.9887 = 0.98 + 0.0087.

Using (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

So (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.017148 + 0.00007569 = approx 0.9604 + 0.01722369 = 0.97762369.

But the actual value is 0.9775, which is just a bit less. So the square root of 0.9775 is a bit less than 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps a better approximation is needed. Let me see: 0.9886^2 = ?

0.9886^2 = (0.988 + 0.0006)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2*(0.988)*(0.0006) + (0.0006)^2.

0.988^2 is (approx) let me calculate:

0.988 * 0.988. 988 * 988: 976,144.

Wait, 0.988^2 = (0.988)(0.988) → 0.988 * 0.988 = 0.976144.

Wait, 988 * 988 = 976,144, so 0.988^2 is 0.976144.

Then 2 * 0.988 * 0.0006 = 2 * 0.0005928 = 0.0011856.

(0.0006)^2 is 0.00000036.

So adding up: 0.976144 + 0.0011856 = 0.9773296, plus 0.00000036 is 0.97733.

But the target is 0.9775, which is 0.00016 more. So perhaps 0.98865?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator for sqrt(0.9775). Alternatively, perhaps I can just accept that beta is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula for decay distance. Another thought: the mean decay length L is given by L = c * β * gamma * τ. Wait, no, because tau is the proper lifetime. Wait, no, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau, so the decay length is c * (gamma tau) * beta, which is c * tau * gamma * beta. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no: the proper lifetime is tau. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the time is gamma tau. The velocity is beta c. So the distance is (beta c) * (gamma tau) ) = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, that's a key point! Oh no, I think that was my mistake earlier. I forgot to multiply by gamma when calculating the mean lifetime in the lab frame.

So the mean decay length L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

Wait, because tau is the proper lifetime (in the meson's rest frame). So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. Therefore, the time available for decay is gamma tau, and velocity is beta c. So L = beta c * gamma tau.

So my previous calculation was missing the gamma factor. That's a big mistake.

So let me recalculate using this corrected approach.

First, compute tau = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = approx 6.66667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma)^2)) ≈ 0.9887.

So L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

So c is 3e8 m/s.

Putting it all together:

L = 3e8 m/s * 0.9887 * 6.66667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute the numerical part step by step.

Compute 0.9887 * 6.66667 ≈ 6.6113.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24: 6.6113 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ approx 13.592e-24.

Wait, 6.6113 * 2.056875 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125.

0.6113 * 2.056875 ≈ approx 1.257.

So total is approximately 12.34125 + 1.257 = 13.59825.

So 13.59825e-24 seconds.

Now, multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

3e8 * 13.59825e-24 = (3 * 13.59825) * 1e-16.

3 * 13.59825 is 40.79475.

So L ≈ 40.79475e-16 m = 4.079475e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, and option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, 4.079e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculation of beta and gamma.

Wait, let me recompute the beta more accurately.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.6666666667.

gamma squared is (6.6666666667)^2 = 44.444444444.

So 1/(gamma^2) is 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute this precisely.

Using a calculator approach:

We can compute sqrt(0.9775) using the Taylor expansion around 1.

But perhaps a better way is to use a calculator-like approach. Let me think.

Let me find x such that x^2 = 0.9775.

Let me try x = 0.9887. As before, x^2 is approx 0.977623.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So the actual x is a bit less than 0.9887.

Let me try x = 0.9886.

x^2 = (0.9886)^2.

Compute 0.9886 * 0.9886:

Compute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.98 * 0.0086 = 0.008428.

0.0086 * 0.98 = 0.008428.

0.0086 * 0.0086 = approx 0.00007396.

So (a + b)^2 with a=0.98, b=0.0086.

= a^2 + 2ab + b^2.

= 0.9604 + 2*(0.98 *0.0086) + 0.00007396.

0.98 *0.0086 = 0.008428 → 2*0.008428 = 0.016856.

So total so far: 0.9604 + 0.016856 = 0.977256.

Plus 0.00007396 → 0.97732996.

But 0.97733 is less than 0.9775. So 0.9886^2 is 0.97733, which is less than 0.9775. So to reach 0.9775, we need x a bit higher than 0.9886.

Let me compute 0.98865^2.

Compute 0.98865 * 0.98865.

= (0.9886 + 0.00005) * (0.9886 +0.00005).

= 0.9886² + 2*(0.9886)(0.00005) + (0.00005)^2.

We know 0.9886² is 0.97733.

2*(0.9886)(0.00005) = 2 *0.00004943 = 0.00009886.

(0.00005)^2= 0.0000000025.

So sum is 0.97733 + 0.00009886 = 0.97742886 + 0.0000000025 ≈ 0.97742886.

Which is still less than 0.9775.

So 0.98865^2 = 0.97742886.

We need to reach 0.9775. So the difference is 0.9775 - 0.97742886 = 0.00007114.

Now, for each additional 0.00001 in x, the square increases by approximately 2 * 0.98865 * 0.00001 = approx 0.000019773.

So to get an increase of 0.00007114, how much delta x do I need?

delta x ≈ 0.00007114 / (2 * 0.98865) ) ≈ 0.00007114 / 1.9773 ≈ approx 0.000036.

So x is approximately 0.98865 + 0.000036 = 0.988686.

So beta ≈ 0.988686.

Now, let's compute beta more accurately as 0.988686.

So the previous step: 0.988686.

Now, let's compute L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

gamma is 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6666666667.

So:

beta = 0.988686.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So compute beta * gamma = 0.988686 * 6.6666666667 ≈ ?

0.988686 * 6 = 5.932116.

0.988686 * 0.6666666667 ≈ 0.659124.

So total is approximately 5.932116 + 0.659124 ≈ 6.59124.

So beta * gamma ≈ 6.59124.

Now multiply by c and tau:

L = 3e8 m/s * 6.59124 * 2.056875e-24 s.

First compute 6.59124 * 2.056875e-24.

6.59124 * 2.056875 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125.

0.59124 * 2.056875:

Compute 0.5 * 2.056875 = 1.0284375.

0.09124 * 2.056875 ≈ approx 0.1878.

So total: 1.0284375 + 0.1878 ≈ 1.2162375.

So overall, 6.59124 * 2.056875 ≈ 12.34125 + 1.2162375 ≈ 13.5574875.

So 13.5574875e-24.

Multiply by 3e8 m/s:

3e8 * 13.5574875e-24 = (3 * 13.5574875) * 1e-16.

3 * 13.5574875 is 40.6724625.

So L ≈ 40.6724625e-16 m = 4.06724625e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value. So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, why didn't I get exactly the same number as option B? Because I approximated beta as 0.988686, but perhaps using more precise calculation would get exactly option B's number.

Alternatively, perhaps I should plug in the exact numbers using more precise calculations.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay width is in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV, which I used correctly. So that part is correct.

Another possible source of error: perhaps the production energy E is the total energy, so E = gamma m c². So that's correct, as I used gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666667.

So with all that, the correct mean decay distance is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which would correspond to option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = c \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relation \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the rest mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), we find:

\[
\gamma^2 = \left( \frac{8}{1.2} \right)^2 = \frac{64}{1.44} \approx 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.9775.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
Substituting into the formula \( L = c \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau \):

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \cdot \gamma \):

\[
\beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5912.
\]

Then, calculate \( c \cdot \tau \):

\[
c \cdot \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.1706 \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5912 \cdot 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The closest option to \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
