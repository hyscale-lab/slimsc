Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So I think this means that |alpha> is a linear combination of these spin-up and spin-down states.

The first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, so what's this operator look like?

Hmm, the matrix is diagonal if i=j, but for i≠j, the elements are hbar/2. Wait no, wait: the given is that Aij = hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, no, because that would make the operator a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal? Wait, but for a 2x2 matrix, i and j can be 1 and 2 (assuming the basis is |up> and |down>). So the matrix would look like:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because that's a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. But that doesn't make sense for an operator's matrix representation because operators often have some structure. Wait, but perhaps the operator is a spin in the x or y direction? Because the Pauli matrices have similar structures. Let me think.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So the operator given in this problem seems similar but with hbar/2 factors. So perhaps the operator is (hbar/2)*σ_x or (hbar/2)*σ_y.

Wait, but let's clarify. The operator's matrix is given as A_ij. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal is zero, and the off-diagonal (where i≠j) is hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, that's the same as (hbar/2) multiplied by the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A is (hbar/2) times σ_x. So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the X (bit-flip) operator. These eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 times hbar/2, respectively.

Wait, wait, because when you have σ_x, its eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So if the operator is (hbar/2) σ_x, then the eigenvalues would be hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So the eigenstates are the same as σ_x's, just scaled by hbar/2.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). These are the eigenstates, and the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So I think that means we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps the measurement is in the basis of A's eigenstates. So to find the probability of each eigenstate, we have to project |alpha> onto each of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator's eigenstates form a new basis, and the probability is the modulus squared of the projection.

So first, perhaps I should normalize the state |alpha> because the problem says it is "proportional" to that vector. So I need to find the normalization factor.

The given vector is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). Let's compute the normalization factor.

The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2).

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2+5) = 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ].

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+x> and |−x>, as I thought earlier.

Express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So let me express |alpha> as c1 |+x> + c2 |−x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

So the probability of getting the eigenvalue hbar/2 is |< +x | alpha >|^2, and similarly for the other eigenstate.

Compute < +x | alpha >.

First, |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ].

So < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(7)) [ < +x | (1+i)|up> + < +x | (2 - i)|down> ].

Compute < +x | up >: (1/sqrt(2)) (1 + 0) ? Wait, no. Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So < +x | up > is (1/sqrt(2)) * 1, because the inner product is [1,1] (from |up> and |down> coefficients) dotted with |up> which is [1, 0]^T.

Wait, better to write:

< +x | up > = (1/sqrt(2)) * 1, because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, < +x | down > = (1/sqrt(2)) *1.

So < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2 - i) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= (1/sqrt(7)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ]

Compute (1+i)+(2-i) = (1+2) + (i -i) )= 3 +0i =3.

So < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) * (1/sqrt(2)) * 3 = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) = 3/sqrt(14).

The probability is the square of the modulus: |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/(14) ≈ 0.642857. Wait, that's approximately 0.64, which is one of the options, option A or D.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it accurately: 9/14 is approximately 0.642857.

Similarly, compute the probability for |−x> eigenstate.

< −x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) < −x | up > + (2 -i) < −x | down > ]

< -x | up > is (1/sqrt(2)) *1, because |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So < −x | up > is 1/sqrt(2), and < −x | down > is (-1)/sqrt(2).

So < −x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2 - i)( -1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= (1/sqrt(7)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So the expression becomes (1/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) )) * (-1 + 2i).

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (7*2) ) = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 9/14 ≈ 0.642857 and 5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but wait, the question says "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator..." So each eigenstate has a certain probability. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36; option D is 0.61, 0.29, etc. Option C has 0.28 and 0.72, which is the reverse. So 9/14 is approximately 0.643 (0.64), and 5/14 is approximately 0.357 (0.36). So option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. That seems to match.

But wait, wait, option A says the average is hbar/7. Let me compute the average value of operator A.

The operator A is the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So the average value is the expectation value of A, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ], let me write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, all multiplied by (1/sqrt(7)).

So <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ (1-i)(2+i) (A_11) + (1-i)(2 -i) A_21 + (2 +i)(1+i) A_12 + (2 +i)(2 -i) A_22 ).

Wait, wait, perhaps better to compute it as:

A is a matrix, so A|alpha> = (A_ij) |alpha's components>.

Wait, |alpha> is a vector [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T, multiplied by 1/sqrt(7). So A|alpha> would be:

A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So A|alpha> = [ (0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)(2 -i) ), ( (hbar/2)(1+i) + 0*(2-i) ) ]^T.

So then <alpha| A |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7))^2 times the inner product of [ (1-i, 2+i) ] with [ (hbar/2)(2 -i), (hbar/2)(1+i) ].

Wait, no, more accurately:

<alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

A |alpha> is [ (0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), ( (hbar/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2-i) ) ) / sqrt(7) ]

So A|alpha> is [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

(1/7) [ (1-i)(hbar/2)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(hbar/2)(1+i) ) ]

Factor out (hbar/2) (1/7):

= (hbar/(2*7)) [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 = 2 -i -2i + (-1) )= 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i^2 = 2 +2i +i -1 = (2-1) + (3i) )= 1 +3i.

Adding these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1+3i) )= 2 +0i =2.

So the expectation value is (hbar/(14)) * 2 = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7. So looking at the options, option A says average hbar/7. Option D says 2hbar/sqrt(7).

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the probabilities.

Wait another way: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of < +x | alpha >. Let me recalculate that.

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

The eigenstate |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Which simplifies to (1/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

The numerator is 3, as I calculated before. So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(14)). So the modulus squared is 9/14 ≈0.642857. So that's correct.

Similarly, the other term is (-1 + 2i) divided by sqrt(14), so modulus squared is (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, 2hbar/sqrt(7).

So our calculated probabilities are closest to option A's 0.64 and 0.36, but wait 9/14 is 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is close to 0.36.

So option A is probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

But wait, option D's average is 2hbar/sqrt(7). Let me calculate what that is numerically. sqrt(7)≈2.6458, so 2hbar/sqrt(7)≈0.7559hbar. But our calculated average is hbar/7≈0.142857hbar, which is not matching option D's average.

Hmm. Another possible approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the expectation value calculation. Let me recalculate it.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Another approach is to compute it using matrix multiplication.

|alpha> is a vector:

|alpha> = [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

So A is:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

So A|alpha> is:

[0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7),
 (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2-i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Now, <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

So the inner product is:

(1-i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7)  +  (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

Factor out hbar/(2 * 7):

= (hbar/(14)) [ (1 - i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

(1 - i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)(-i)
= 2 - i - 2i + i²
= 2 -3i -1 (since i²=-1)
= 1 -3i

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 + 2i +i + (-1)
= (2-1) + 3i
= 1 +3i

Add them: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) = 2.

So inner product = (hbar/(14)) * 2 = hbar/7.

So the average is hbar/7. So option A's average is correct.

But let me look at the options again. Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that matches.

Wait, but wait, the states for the operator are |+x> and |−x>. The probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. I think I did that correctly.

So the correct answer should be option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the normalization factor:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is equivalent to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
The corresponding eigenvalues are \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates of \( A \)
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), project \( |\alpha\rangle \) onto these states:
\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2, \quad P(-x) = |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2.
\]

#### Projection onto \( |+x\rangle \):
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)\langle +x | \uparrow \rangle + (2-i)\langle +x | \downarrow \rangle \right].
\]
Using \( \langle +x | \uparrow \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( \langle +x | \downarrow \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), we get:
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

#### Projection onto \( |-x\rangle \):
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)\langle -x | \uparrow \rangle + (2-i)\langle -x | \downarrow \rangle \right].
\]
Using \( \langle -x | \uparrow \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( \langle -x | \downarrow \rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), we get:
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right] \) and \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), compute:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{7} \left[ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) \right].
\]
Expanding:
\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 1 - 3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 1 + 3i.
\]
Adding these:
\[
(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively. The average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match the values in **Option A**.
