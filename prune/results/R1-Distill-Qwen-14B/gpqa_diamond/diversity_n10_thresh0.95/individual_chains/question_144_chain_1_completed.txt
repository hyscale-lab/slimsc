Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can figure out.

The question says X is a meson resonance. They gave me the production energy EX = 8 GeV, mass mX = 1.2 GeV, and width ΓX = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D with various numbers. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or proper length) of a particle is related to its lifetime. The formula involves the speed of light and the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the mean decay length L is c multiplied by the lifetime τ. But how do I find τ?

Oh, right! The lifetime τ is given by the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (Γ) is related to the uncertainty in time (τ) by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. 

But wait, Γ is the decay width, and it's given in MeV. I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let's convert everything into the same units.

So first, let's compute the lifetime τ. Then I'll find the speed of the meson because particles moving faster will have a longer decay length. 

Wait, what's the meson's speed? Since it's produced with a certain energy, I can find its velocity. The production energy EX is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is 8 GeV, and mass energy is 1.2 GeV. 

Using the relativistic energy formula, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. So the momentum p will be sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c. Wait, but since we're working in units where c=1 (like GeV and GeV/c²), maybe I can just calculate p as sqrt(E² - m²). 

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So p² c² = E² - (m c²)^2. Since I'm using c=1 in these units, p² = E² - m². So p = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV/c. Let me calculate that. 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. Square root of 62.56 is about 7.91 GeV/c.

So the momentum p is approximately 7.91 GeV/c. Then, the velocity beta (β) is (pc²)/(E). Since E is 8 GeV, and pc is 7.91 GeV (since pc = (GeV/c) * c = GeV), so β = (7.91) / 8. Let's compute that. 7.91 divided by 8 is about 0.98875. So β ≈ 0.9888.

So velocity v is βc, which is approximately 0.9888 * c. 

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Wait, Γ is in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. Let me recall the values. 

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me compute that.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. 

Now, the mean decay length L is v * τ. So L = β c τ. Let me plug in the numbers.

β is approximately 0.9888, c is speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s. So L = 0.9888 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.9888 ≈ 0.989 (approximating for easier calculation). So 0.989 *3e8 = 2.967e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.967e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.967 * 2.056875) × 1e-16.

Compute 2.967 * 2.056875. Let me do 3 * 2.056875 is about 6.17, but since it's 2.967, it's a bit less. Let me calculate exact:

2.967 * 2.056875.

Well, 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.967 * 2.056875 ≈ 2. (0.9 * 2.056875=1.8511875) and 0.067 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.137575625. So 1.8511875 + 0.137575625 ≈ 1.988763125. So total is 4.11375 + 1.988763125 ≈ 6.102513125.

So approximately 6.1025e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is 5.0223e-16 m.

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, but I approximated some numbers, perhaps I should do a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let me recompute.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate without approximating beta.

Alternative approach:

Compute beta exactly. 

p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

So beta = p c / E = (7.91 GeV/c) * c / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

So beta is 0.98875.

So beta is 0.98875, not 0.989.

So, let's compute v = beta c = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.

Wait, 0.98875 is 0.98875. Let's compute 0.98875 * 3e8.

0.98875 * 3e8 = (0.98875 *3)*1e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.

Now, time τ is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV.

Wait, let me recheck that. Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 divided by 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 is 18.69375 when multiplied by 20. So 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So τ is 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So v is 2.96625e8 m/s, τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, L = v * τ = 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.96625 * 2.056875.

Let me compute that exactly. 2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325. 2.96625 * 0.056875.

Compute 2.96625 * 0.05 = 0.1483125.

2.96625 * 0.006875 = approximately 0.020390625.

So 0.1483125 + 0.020390625 = 0.168703125.

So total is 5.9325 + 0.168703125 = 6.101203125.

So L = 6.101203125e8 * 1e-24 = 6.1012e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options are close to 6e-16, but the options are in the 4-5e-15 or e-16. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic considerations again. Wait, the mean decay length is L = β c τ. But is τ the proper time or the lab frame time? Oh, I think τ is the proper lifetime, which is the same in all frames because it's the lifetime in the rest frame. So yes, the calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation during the multiplication. Let me double-check:

2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Breaking it down: 2.96625 * 2.056875 = ?

Let me compute 2.96625 * 2.056875.

Let me compute:

2.96625
× 2.056875
-------------
= ?

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 2.96625 × 2.056875.

Another approach: 2.96625 × 2 = 5.9325.

2.96625 × 0.056875 ≈ Let me compute 0.056875 is 56875e-6. So 2.96625 × 0.05 = 0.1483125.

2.96625 × 0.006875: 0.006875 is 11/1600. 2.96625 × 0.006875 = 

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 2.056875 = 2 + 0.056875.

So 2.96625 × 2 = 5.9325.

2.96625 × 0.056875:

Compute 0.05 × 2.96625 = 0.1483125.

0.006875 × 2.96625:

0.006875 is 11/1600. 2.96625 × 11 = 32.62875. Divide by 1600: 32.62875 /1600 ≈ 0.02039296875.

So total 0.1483125 + 0.02039296875 ≈ 0.16870546875.

So total 5.9325 + 0.16870546875 = 6.10120546875.

So L = 6.10120546875e-16 meters.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option A (5.02e-16) and option C (5.02e-15). Wait, none of the options are close to 6e-16. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation of the proper time. Wait, another approach: the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ/(Γ). But wait, sometimes the decay width is given as Γ, and the lifetime is τ = ħ/(Γ). But wait, Γ is the total decay width, and the natural line width is Γ. So yes, that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using more precise values, like the exact value of ħ. Let's try recalculating ħ.

The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me use that.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25.

6.582 divided by 0.32: Let's compute that precisely.

0.32 × 20 = 6.4, so 20 gives 6.4. 6.582 -6.4=0.182.

So 0.182 /0.32 = 0.56875.

So 20.56875, so 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the beta calculation. Let me recheck that.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c.

So beta = p c / E = (7.91 GeV/c * c ) /8 GeV = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate L = βc τ without approximating.

So, L = 0.98875 * c * τ.

c is 3e8 m/s.

τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this as 0.98875 *3 = 2.96625.

So 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the numbers: 2.96625 * 2.056875 = ?

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach for precise calculation.

Compute 2.96625 × 2.056875.

Let me compute this as:

2.056875 = 2 + 0.05 + 0.006875.

So,

2.96625 × 2 = 5.9325

2.96625 × 0.05 = 0.1483125

2.96625 × 0.006875 = approximately 0.02039296875.

Adding these together: 5.9325 + 0.1483125 = 6.0808125; plus 0.02039296875 = 6.10120546875.

So, L = 6.10120546875e8 * 1e-24 m.

Which is 6.10120546875e-16 meters.

But the options don't have this number. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me check again.

Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Correct.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Correct.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Then, L = β c τ = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Which is 0.98875 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply the constants: 0.98875 *3 = 2.96625.

2.96625 * 2.056875 = 6.10120546875.

So 6.101205e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options match. The closest is option A (5.02e-16), which is about 1.1e-16 m less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the momentum. Let me double-check.

E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

So, pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2) = sqrt(64 -1.44) GeV.

Wait, in units where c=1, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so pc is in GeV.

So pc = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

So beta = (pc) / E =7.91 /8 = 0.98875. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using more precise values for sqrt(62.56):

62.56 is 62.56. Let me compute it more accurately.

What is sqrt(62.56)?

Well, 7.9^2 is 62.41, because 7^2=49, 0.9^2=0.81, and 2*7*0.9=12.6. So 7.9^2= (8 -0.1)^2 =64 -1.6 +0.01=62.41.

62.56 is 0.15 higher than 62.41.

So let me try 7.9 + delta, where (7.9 + delta)^2 =62.56.

(7.9)^2 =62.41.

2*7.9*delta + delta^2 =62.56-62.41=0.15.

Assume delta is small, so delta^2 negligible.

So 15.8 delta ≈ 0.15 → delta ≈ 0.15 /15.8 ≈ 0.00949.

So sqrt(62.56)≈7.9095, approximately 7.9095 GeV.

So p =7.9095 GeV/c.

Then beta =7.9095/8=0.9886875.

So beta is approximately 0.9886875.

So let's compute L again with this more precise beta.

v = beta *c =0.9886875 *3e8= 2.9660625e8 m/s.

τ=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=2.9660625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

=2.9660625 * 2.056875 × 1e-16.

Compute 2.9660625 ×2.056875.

Let me compute 2.9660625 *2.056875:

Break it down.

2.056875 is 2 + 0.05 + 0.006875.

2.9660625 *2 =5.932125.

2.9660625 *0.05=0.148303125.

2.9660625 *0.006875= ?

Compute 2.9660625 *0.006875.

Well, 0.006875 is 11/1600.

Compute 2.9660625 * 11 =32.6266875.

Divide by 1600: 32.6266875 /1600 =0.0203916796875.

So adding up:

5.932125 +0.148303125=6.080428125.

Plus 0.0203916796875=6.10082, approximately.

So L=6.10082e-16 meters.

Hmm, same result as before. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy units again. Did I mix up GeV and MeV somewhere?

Wait, the production energy is EX=8 GeV, but perhaps the mass is given as mX=1.2 GeV. That's correct.

Another thought: the decay width Γ is given in MeV, but perhaps I should have converted it to GeV correctly.

Wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So my calculation is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the meson is at rest, but no, the problem states it's produced with energy EX=8 GeV, which is higher than its rest mass, so it's moving.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mean path length as L = (c * τ) * (gamma * beta), but no, I think I was correct. Because tau is the proper time, and the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma*tau. So the lifetime observed is gamma*tau, and velocity is beta c, so L = v * gamma tau = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, wait a minute! I think I made a mistake here. Because the proper lifetime is tau, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation, by a factor of gamma. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

So the mean decay length L is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime. So L = v * (gamma tau).

Wait, but wait, where did I miss that?

Hmm, so earlier I thought L = beta c tau, but perhaps that's wrong because tau is the proper time, and I should be using the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma * tau.

So, correction: L = v * (gamma tau) = beta c * (gamma tau).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Wait, beta we've already calculated as approximately 0.98875, so gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - (0.98875)^2).

Compute 0.98875 squared: (0.98875)^2 = approx 0.9775.

So 1 -0.9775 = 0.0225.

sqrt(0.0225)=0.15.

So gamma=1/0.15≈6.6667.

So L = beta c gamma tau.

So,

beta =0.98875,

gamma≈6.6667,

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L= (0.98875) * (3e8 m/s) * (6.6667) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

Compute beta*gamma: 0.98875 *6.6667 ≈6.6 (since 0.98875*6.6667= (approx 6.6 * 0.98875)= around 6.525).

Wait, 0.98875 *6.6667:

6.6667 * 0.98875 = (6 *0.98875) + (0.6667 *0.98875).

6 *0.98875=5.9325.

0.6667 *0.98875 ≈0.659166.

Total≈5.9325 +0.659166≈6.59166.

So beta*gamma ≈6.59166.

Thus, L= beta gamma c tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L = 6.59166 *3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the numbers: 6.59166 *3 =19.77498.

19.77498 * 2.056875 ≈?

Compute 20 *2.056875=41.1375.

Subtract (0.22502 *2.056875):

0.22502 *2.056875 ≈0.4626.

So 41.1375 -0.4626 ≈40.6749.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 6.59166 *3=19.77498.

19.77498 *2.056875:

Break it down as 2 +0.05 +0.006875.

19.77498 *2 =39.54996.

19.77498 *0.05=0.988749.

19.77498 *0.006875≈0.135656.

Adding them up:39.54996 +0.988749=40.538709 +0.135656=40.674365.

So L=40.674365e8 *1e-24 m.

Which is 40.674365e-16 m =4.0674365e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m and option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, so 4.067e-15 m is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m). So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but why did I get a different result when I accounted for gamma?

Ah, so earlier I forgot to multiply by gamma. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So the decay length is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma tau.

So the correct approach is L = v * gamma tau.

Which gives a longer decay length.

So I must have made a mistake earlier by not considering gamma. That's why my initial calculation didn't match any options.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the relationship:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity of the meson in units of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the meson, with \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \)
The meson's energy is \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \implies p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{62.56} \, \text{GeV}/c \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}/c.
\]

The velocity factor \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \frac{pc}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875.
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.98875)^2}} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9775}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0225}} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau = (0.98875)(6.6667)(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})(2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}).
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = (0.98875)(6.6667) \approx 6.59166.
\]

Now, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.59166 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

Break this into parts:
- \( 6.59166 \cdot 3 = 19.77498 \),
- \( 19.77498 \cdot 2.056875 \approx 40.6744 \).

Thus:

\[
L = 40.6744 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} = 4.06744 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
