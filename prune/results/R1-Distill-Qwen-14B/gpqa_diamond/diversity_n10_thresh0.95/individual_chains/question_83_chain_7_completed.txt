Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Alright, first, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form acetate ions and water. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

Wait, before I get into the titration, I should figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Oh right, dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L), and we add 20 cm³ water, making it 40 cm³ (0.04 L) total.

So the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution would be (volume1 * conc1) / (volume1 + volume2). So 20 * 0.05 = 1 mmol. Then divided by 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So 1 mmol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so initial moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Correct. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So that's right.

Now, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The stoichiometry is 1:1 between acetic acid and NaOH. So the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

At equivalence, moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added, it's the equivalence point.

But the question asks for two points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Wait, 25% of what? The total volume to reach equivalence is 10 cm³. So 25% titration would be adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let's think about that.

Wait, actually, in titration, sometimes the percentage refers to the fraction of the acid that's been neutralized. So 25% titration means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

But in any case, let's proceed.

First, let's handle the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. So 25% is 0.00025 mol reacted.

Moles unreacted: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

So the solution will be a buffer solution, consisting of acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate).

The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is given as the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.73. Wait, let me calculate it. log(1.85e-5) is about log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.73 (since pKa = -log(Ka) = 4.73). Right.

So [A^-] is the concentration of acetate, [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.

But wait, I need to find the concentrations after mixing, considering the added NaOH.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), and then we add 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of NaOH. So the total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the moles of acetic acid is 0.00075 mol, and acetate is 0.00025 mol.

So the concentrations:

Concentration of HA (acetic acid) = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of A^- (acetate) = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So applying Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.25.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. Wait, maybe I should be precise with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio more accurately.

0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882353 mol/L.

0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647059 mol/L.

Ratio: 0.005882353 / 0.017647059 = 0.333333333.

So log(1/3) is exactly -0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.4771 = 4.2529. Approximately 4.25. So option A is 4.26, which is close. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. But since NaOH is a strong base, the solution will contain only the conjugate base (acetate ions) in solution, which will hydrolyze to form OH- ions, making the solution basic.

So the moles of acetate at equivalence point: 0.001 mol.

The total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) reacts with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, that's Kb. Then, to find the pH, we can treat the solution as a weak base. The concentration is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assuming that x is small compared to 0.02, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485.

pH = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515.

So approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A has pH 4.26 and 8.52. Wait, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that would fit.

Wait, but let's check the options again. Option A is 4.26;8.52. That matches what I've calculated. So the pH at 25% is about 4.25 (option A says 4.26), and equivalence point pH is 8.52. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait another thought. Wait, at equivalence point, is the solution only acetate ions?

Yes, because all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the solution is 0.02 M acetate.

Alternatively, sometimes in such problems, the volume is considered differently. Let me double-check the volumes.

Initial volume: 20 cm³ acetic acid + 20 cm³ water → 40 cm³. Then, adding 10 cm³ NaOH (for equivalence), total volume is 50 cm³. So 0.001 mol acetate in 0.05 L → 0.02 M. Correct.

So yes, the calculations look correct. So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25, and at equivalence it's 8.52. So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Since the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol, 25% of this amount is:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid reacted} = 0.001 \times 0.25 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining unreacted acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Moles of unreacted acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions (conjugate base) formed are equal to the moles of acetic acid reacted:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ions} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.0176} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25.

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate ions are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ions} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \(K_b\) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Assuming \(x\) is small compared to 0.02 M, the equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \times 0.02 = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \times 0.02 = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydroxide ion concentration is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = x \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
