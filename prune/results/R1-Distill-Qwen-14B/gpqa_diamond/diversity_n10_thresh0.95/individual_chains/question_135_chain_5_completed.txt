Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think maybe I misread that. Oh right, the Lagrangian is probably something like L = -λ f ψ_f (y) [v + X(y)] ψ_f(y). So that's the interaction term. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. And the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D.

I remember that when a particle decays, the energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for a decay X → something, the sum of the rest masses of the products must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

Wait, but wait. For fermions, each quark or lepton has a rest mass. So for X to decay into a pair of particles like b bbar, each b quark has a certain mass. Let me think about the masses of the quarks and leptons.

So, I need to list all possible fermion pairs that the X boson can decay into, considering their rest masses. The X is 6 GeV, so each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV, negligible compared to 6 GeV.
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV, same here.
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV, also much less than GeV scale.
- Charm quark (c): about 1.3 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So X can't decay into t and tbar because 2*173 GeV is way more than 6 GeV.
- Lepton masses:
   - Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV, negligible.
   - Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV.
   - Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV.
   - Neutrinos are even lighter, so no problem, but in the Lagrangian, the interaction is with ψ_f, which includes all fermions including neutrinos. But in terms of decay products, probably they are considering charged leptons, but not sure. The options include e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

So for each fermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me go through each possible decay channel:

Option A: bb, ss, uu, dd, tau+ tau-, e+ e-
- bb: each b is ~4.5 GeV. So 4.5 +4.5 =9 GeV. That's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A can't be correct because it includes bb. So option A is not the right answer.

Option B: cc, ss, uu, dd, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Check each:
- cc: 1.3 +1.3=2.6 GeV <6. So allowed.
- ss: 0.095*2=0.19 <6, allowed.
- uu: negligible.
- dd: same.
- tau+ tau-: 1.777 *2 = ~3.554 GeV <6, allowed.
- mu+ mu-: 0.105*2=0.21 <6, allowed.
- e+ e-: negligible, allowed.
So all these decay channels are possible. So B is a candidate.

Option C: cc, ss, uu, dd, tt, tau, mu, e
But tt has each t quark at ~173 GeV, so 2*173=346 GeV >>6 GeV. So tt is not allowed. So option C is invalid.

Option D: bb, ss, uu, dd, tau, mu, e
Again, bb is 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass. So D is invalid.

So the only valid options are B and maybe others. Wait, what about other fermions? Like, are there any other quarks besides c, s, u, d that X can decay into? Let me think about the possible fermions.

Wait, the given Lagrangian has ψ_f as a fermion field. So the interaction is with all fermions except maybe the top, but top is too heavy as discussed.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is -λf ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, maybe the v is a constant or a scalar, perhaps the Higgs VEV? Then X is a boson coupled to the fermions.

So for decay, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than 6 GeV.

So checking each possible pair:

- c cbar: 2.6 GeV (allowed)
- s sbar: 0.19 GeV (allowed)
- u ubar: 4.4 MeV (allowed, but maybe negligible)
- d dbar: 9.4 MeV (allowed)
- tau+ tau-: 3.55 GeV (allowed)
- mu+ mu-: 0.21 GeV (allowed)
- e+ e-: 1.02 MeV (allowed)
- Bottom: 9 GeV (not allowed)
- Top: no way.

What about other quarks? Like, are there any other quarks? There are only up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. So the possible fermion pairs are the ones I considered.

So the allowed decay channels are:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but in the options, option B includes all these except the 't tbar' which isn't present, and option B includes exactly these.

Wait option B is: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says "bosonic field X". So in the Lagrangian, interaction is with fermions. So X can decay into any pair of fermions as long as their combined mass is less than X's mass.

But wait, another possibility: the X is a scalar, vector boson, or something else. But the Lagrangian is given as a scalar interaction, probably. Because it's written as λ f ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. So it's probably a Yukawa-like coupling.

So, the decay products can be any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

So for each fermion, 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So looking at each fermion's mass:

c: 1.3 GeV → allowed.

b:4.5 GeV → 2m=9 GeV>6. Not allowed.

t:173 GeV, way over.

Tau:1.77 GeV → allowed.

mu: 0.105 GeV → allowed.

e: 0.000511 GeV → allowed.

What about the strange quark? Its mass is about 95-100 MeV. So 2*0.095=0.19 GeV <6, allowed.

So all the fermions except b and t can be decay products.

So X can decay into: (c cbar), (s sbar), (u ubar), (d dbar), (tau+ tau-), (mu+ mu-), (e+ e-).

Wait, but wait, the possible decay products include all of these. So the correct option is B.

But looking at the options:

Option B) X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes. So the correct answer is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the combined rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

The rest masses of the relevant fermions are approximately:

- \( u \): \( 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \) (negligible compared to 6 GeV),
- \( d \): \( 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (negligible),
- \( s \): \( 95 \, \text{MeV} \),
- \( c \): \( 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( b \): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy),
- \( \tau \): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \mu \): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \),
- \( e \): \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \) (negligible).

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), where \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is not allowed. Hence, **Option A is invalid**.

2. **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \). Checking each:
   - \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2m_c = 2.6 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2m_u = 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2m_d = 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e = 1.02 \, \text{MeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   All decay channels in **Option B are allowed**.

3. **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), where \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is not allowed. Hence, **Option C is invalid**.

4. **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), where \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is not allowed. Hence, **Option D is invalid**.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are listed in **Option B**: \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \).

Answer: B
