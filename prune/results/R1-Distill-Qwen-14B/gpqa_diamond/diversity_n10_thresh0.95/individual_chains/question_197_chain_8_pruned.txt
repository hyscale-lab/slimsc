Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a final product from a reaction involving Compound X. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the hydrolysis of certain organophosphorus compounds, maybe something like the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride or maybe an ester? Or wait, alternatively, perhaps it's about the hydrolysis of a nitrile? Wait no, that's with other conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's about the dehydrohalogenation or something else. Hmm, maybe I should first figure out what Compound X is.

The question provides IR and NMR data for Compound X. Let me look at the IR data first. The peaks are in the ranges 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. The 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around where aromatic C=C stretches appear, so there's probably an aromatic ring involved.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have broad protons around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H for both possibilities. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchangeable proton like an -OH group, but in that case, maybe the integration would be more than one if it's a diol or something else. So, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad peak due to exchange with water. So, 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet could be a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could also be an aldehyde if it's a single proton. But let me check the other peaks.

At 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, perhaps a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The doublets indicate coupling with two adjacent protons each. So, maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, each with two equivalent protons. So, for example, a substituent in the para position, and maybe another substituent elsewhere? Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene where each substituent is a group that causes the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Then we have 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be a methine (CH) group attached to something else. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen or another carbon. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group next to a branching point. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): that's a triplet of protons, maybe a methyl group attached to a CH. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, perhaps part of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together. Let's think about the structure. So, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. Each substituent is in the para position relative to each other. Wait, but wait, because the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H, that would suggest two substituents on the ring, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. So, for example, if the ring is substituted at positions 1 and 3, but that might not lead to such a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, like positions 1 and 4, but that would mean each substituent is in a position where the adjacent protons are on opposite sides. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, but each substituent is a group that causes the adjacent Hs to split into doublets. For example, if each substituent is a methyl group, but that would make the protons adjacent to them as doublets. Hmm, but wait, perhaps the substituents are more complex.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic ring is part of a benzoic acid or similar. Because I'm seeing a carbonyl in the IR, and a high ppm proton in the NMR. So, if the 10.5 ppm peak is a carboxylic acid, then maybe the compound is a substituted benzoic acid.

Let me think: If the structure is a substituted benzoic acid, then the IR would have peaks for the carboxylic acid (broad O-H around 2500-3300, which is in the given data, but wait the IR data starts at 3400, so maybe that's the O-H stretch. Then 1720 cm-1 could be the C=O of the acid. Wait, but wait, the 1720 cm-1 could also be an ester or a ketone. Let me think.

Alternatively, the IR has a 1720 cm-1 which is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl might be a bit lower, like around 1700. But esters are higher, maybe 1730-1750. Wait, but benzoic acid's carbonyl is about 1680-1720 cm-1, depending on substitution. So 1720 could fit. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be higher, perhaps around 1740. Hmm.

But looking at the NMR, 10.5 ppm is a strong indication for a carboxylic acid. The broad singlet suggests it's exchanging, which is typical for -COOH. So perhaps the compound is a substituted benzoic acid.

So, the aromatic ring is para-substituted with another group, and has a COOH group in one position. Let's say, for example, the COOH is in the para position relative to another substituent.

Looking at the NMR data again:

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests two substituents on the ring. Wait, but wait: in a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is in the para position relative to another substituent. Wait, maybe the ring has two substituents, each in para positions. But that would mean a di-substituted benzene with substituents at opposite ends.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, but that would mean the substituents are in the para positions. But in that case, each substituent would have two adjacent H's. Wait, for example, if you have substituents at 1 and 4 positions, then each substituent is in a position where the adjacent Hs are on the ring. For instance, substituent at position 1 is a COOH group, and substituent at position 4 is another group, perhaps an ethyl group or a branched alkyl.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets. So, perhaps the substituents are para to each other, and each substituent is de-shielding the adjacent protons. For example, if the substituents are a COOH group and a methyl group, but that wouldn't account for the 2.9, 1.7, etc. Alternatively, maybe the other substituent is part of a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a side chain that includes a CH2 group or more. Let's think about the NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): could be a CH group adjacent to another CH group or an oxygen. Like in a CH2CH2 group, maybe as part of a larger substituent.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 connected to a branch, maybe a CH2 connected to a CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps a CH(CH3) group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, like CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but in a branched arrangement. Let me think: the 1.4 ppm d (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm t (3H) is a CH2CH3 group. The 2.9 ppm m (1H) could be a CH group attached to another CH2, and the 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 connected to the benzene and another CH group.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like benzene with a substituent that is a propyl chain, but with branching. For example, if the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Wait, but let's try to draw this.

Suppose the substituent on the benzene is a group like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. But wait, the NMR signals don't seem to fit that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group. But let's think about the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. But wait, let's see. The substituent would be attached to the benzene as a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. But wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think about the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a CH2 and another CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group, perhaps between two CH groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but connected in a way that makes sense. Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. But that would give a terminal CH3. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group has the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, because that would be a tertiary butyl group. Wait, no. Wait, wait: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-. sec-Butyl would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting the nomenclature wrong. Let's clarify:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (straight chain)
- iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2- (the CH2 is attached to the CH(CH3)2)
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- (but that's actually a pentyl group, perhaps? Maybe I'm mixing up the terms.)

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the substituent as a butyl group, specifically a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. But I'm not getting it right. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, bs): likely COOH.
- 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene.
- 2.9 (m, 1H): maybe a CH group connected to a CH2 and another CH.
- 1.7 (m, 2H): perhaps two adjacent CH2 groups.
- 1.4 (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.
- 0.9 (t, 3H): a terminal methyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene. Wait, so that would be a pentyl group in a specific configuration. Alternatively, the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. But let me try to draw it:

The benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a substituent at position 4. The substituent is a chain: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a propyl chain with a methyl branch, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent would be:

Benzene ringâ€”COOH at position 1, and at position 4, a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

But then what about the NMR signals? The 2.9 ppm (1H) could be the CH between the two CH2 groups. Wait, but in that case, the structure would be benzene-COOH and benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)â€”but I'm not sure.

Alternatively,
