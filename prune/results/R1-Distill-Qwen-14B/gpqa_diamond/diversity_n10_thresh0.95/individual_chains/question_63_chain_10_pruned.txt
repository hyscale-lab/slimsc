Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model for diatomic molecules. Hmm, I remember that in such models, the molecule's behavior combines both rotational and vibrational aspects. The question is about what happens when a photon is absorbed, causing the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

The molecule is currently in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it must transition to the next possible state. But wait, what's the next state? I think for diatomic molecules, transitions can be either vibrational or rotational. Oh wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, transitions involve both rotational and vibrational energy changes.

Wait, no, the question specifies it's in the fundamental state. That means it's in the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1? Hmm, wait, the rigid rotor model has energy levels for rotation, but the non-rigid rotor might be a bit different. Or wait, maybe the non-rigid rotor model here refers to considering the bond length as variable, but perhaps that's not directly relevant for this question.

Wait, the problem is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that refers to the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which transition requires the least energy? Because the photon's momentum depends on the energy of the transition.

So, to find the momentum of the photon, I need to calculate the energy difference between the initial and final states, and then relate that to the photon's momentum. Because the photon's energy is related to its momentum via E = pc, where c is the speed of light.

But wait, let me think. Momentum p is related to energy E. For a photon, E = pc. So if I can find the energy difference (ΔE) between the initial and final states, then p = ΔE / c.

So what is the energy difference when the molecule absorbs a photon to move to the next state? The next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy increase. Which transition has a lower energy: vibrational or rotational?

In a diatomic molecule, vibrational energy levels are quantized as well, and the spacing between vibrational levels is much larger than the rotational spacing. So the energy difference for a vibrational transition is higher than for a rotational transition.

Wait, but in the fundamental state, the vibrational state is v=0. The next vibrational state would be v=1. But the energy difference for that is ΔE_vib = (1/2) h w, since each vibrational level is spaced by h w. Wait, no, wait: for a quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w. Because (1 + 1/2)h w - (0 + 1/2)h w = h w.

For rotational transitions, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be E_J=1 - E_J=0 = B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B. Because J has to change by ±2 for dipole allowed transitions, wait no, that's for rigid rotor selection rules. Wait, for rigid rotor, the dipole selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. Wait no, wait, rotational selection rules allow ΔJ = ±1, but in the rigid rotor model, the transition from J=0 to J=1 is allowed. Oh wait, no, wait: for a rigid rotor, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, so J=0 can go to J=1. So the energy difference would be E_1 - E_0 = [ (1)(2) B ] - 0 = 2B.

So which is smaller: 2B or h w? Because if 2B is smaller than h w, then the rotational transition would require less energy, so the photon would have smaller momentum.

So which is it? I need to compute B and compare it to (1/2) h w, but wait, the energy difference for vibration is h w. Wait, no, wait, the energy between v=0 and v=1 is h w, because E_v=1 - E_v=0 = [ (1 + 1/2) h w ] - [ (0 + 1/2) h w ] = h w.

So I need to find whether 2B is less than h w.

If 2B < h w, then the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon would have lower momentum in that case.

So let's compute B and h w.

Wait, B is the rotational constant, which is given by B = (h)/(8 π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia. Wait, no, wait, the formula for the rotational energy levels is E_J = B J (J+1), where B is h/(8 π² I c) or something like that? Or is it B = ħ²/(2 I), but no, I think I'm confusing it with the moment of inertia in rotational energy.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (ħ² J (J + 1))/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. So B is ħ²/(2 I). Or perhaps B is something else. Let me think: The rotational constant B is given by B = h/(8 π² c I), where c is the speed of light. Hmm, I need to be careful.

Wait, the rotational constant B is defined as B = (h²)/(8 π² I k c), where k is Boltzmann's constant? Or perhaps I'm mixing up things.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the moment of inertia I. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So, μ is the reduced mass, which is (m_X * m_Y)/(m_X + m_Y). The masses are given: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, wait. 20 + 2 is 22, so 40/22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Right.

But I need to convert that into kg. Because I need I in kg m².

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ approx 2.999e-27 kg. Wait, wait, 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988, so maybe around 3.0e-27 kg for μ?

Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute it exactly.

1.818 * 1.6605 = approx. Let's compute 1.8 * 1.66 = 2.988, 0.018 * 1.6605= ~0.02989. So sum is ~2.988 + 0.0299= ~3.0179. So 3.0179e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20. So 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Now, B is the rotational constant, which is E_J/(J(J+1)) for each J. The energy levels are E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I). So B is ħ²/(2 I).

Wait, ħ is h-bar, which is h/(2π). So ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So, ħ² would be (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So 2 I is 2 * 1.2072e-46 = 2.4144e-46 kg m².

So B = ħ²/(2 I) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4144e-46) ≈ approx 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, is that correct? Let me compute 1.112e-68 / 2.4144e-46.

Dividing exponents: 1e-68 /1e-46 = 1e-22. So 1.112 / 2.4144 ≈ 0.4607. So 0.4607e-22 = 4.607e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

Then, the energy difference for rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) is 2B, because E_J=1 - E_J=0 = B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B. So 2 * 4.607e-23 = 9.214e-23 J.

Now, let's compute h w. The angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J s.

So h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So now, let's compare 2B and h w.

2B is 9.214e-23 J. h w is 2.65e-19 J.

So 2B is much smaller than h w. So the energy required for a rotational transition is much less than that for a vibrational transition.

Therefore, the molecule can transition via a rotational change to the next state with lower energy than a vibrational transition. So the photon absorbed will provide the energy for a rotational transition.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. So if the molecule is in v=0 and J=0, what is the next state? The next state with the lowest energy would be J=1, because the energy of J=1 is higher than J=0, but lower than a vibrational transition. So the photon's energy should be the rotational energy difference.

So the energy required is ΔE = 2B.

But wait, in the quantum rotor model, can J go to J=1 from J=0? I thought for rigid rotor, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1, so yes, J=0 can go to J=1.

So the energy change is 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

Then, the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE = 9.214e-23 J.

Since E = p c, where p is momentum, we can find p.

c is the speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

So p = E_photon / c = (9.214e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, wait. That computation doesn't match any of the options given. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. Wait, but 3e-31 is much smaller.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for B. Let me think again.

Wait, another formula for the rotational constant: B = ħ²/(2 I). Wait, no, perhaps the rotational energy is E_J = B J (J + 1), and B is the rotational constant in cm^-1. Or perhaps in Joules.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing B with another constant. Let me double-check.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I) = (J (J+1)) * (ħ²/(2 I)).

So, yes, that's correct. So B = ħ²/(2 I).

But wait, in some contexts, B is given in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), but here, I think we are using it in Joules.

Wait, perhaps the rotational constant B is given by h/(8 π² I c), as I thought earlier.

Wait, let's compute B using that formula. So B = h/(8 π² I c).

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

I is 1.2072e-46 kg·m².

c is 3e8 m/s.

So 8 π² I c = 8 * (pi^2) * 1.2072e-46 * 3e8.

Compute denominator first:

pi^2 is about 9.8696.

8 *9.8696 = approx 78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.2072e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 * 1.2072 ≈ 95.3 (since 78 * 1.2 is ~93.6, and 78 * 0.0072 etc. would add a bit more). So approx 95.3e-46 = 9.53e-45.

Multiply by c (3e8): 9.53e-45 * 3e8 = 2.859e-36.

So denominator is 2.859e-36.

B = h / denominator = (6.626e-34) / (2.859e-36) ≈ (6.626 / 2.859) * 1e2 = approx 2.318 * 100 = 231.8.

Wait, units? Because h is in J·s, denominator is kg·m²/s, so B would be (J s) / (kg m²/s) )= (kg m²/s² * s) ) / (kg m²/s) )= (kg m²/s² * s) * s/(kg m²) )= (m²/s²) * s²/(m²) )= 1/s²? Wait, perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of energy. E_J is in Joules, so B must have units of energy per J(J+1). So let's see: B is h/(8 π² I c) → h has units J·s; I is kg·m²; c is m/s.

So units of denominator: 8 pi² I c → kg·m²
