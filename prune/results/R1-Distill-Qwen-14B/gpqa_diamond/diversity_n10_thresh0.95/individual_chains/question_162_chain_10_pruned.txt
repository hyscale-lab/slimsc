Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The given metric is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions, maybe polar coordinates? Because dx² + dy² is the standard Euclidean metric. But the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh right, so this must be some sort of conformally flat metric. The overall structure is like a conformal factor multiplied by the flat metric.

I remember that the area element in a 2D metric is given by sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But since this is conformally flat, the metric can be written as g_{ij} = f(x,y) δ_{ij}, so the determinant is f squared. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

In 2D, the metric tensor is a 2x2 matrix. If the metric is diagonal, then the determinant is the product of the diagonal elements. So here, the metric is (32/(4-x²-y²)) times (dx² + dy²), which means the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the metric tensor is diag( f, f ), where f = 32/(4 - r²) if I switch to polar coordinates. Because x² + y² is r².

So the determinant g is f². Then the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, which is sqrt(f²) dx dy = f dx dy. So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy. Wait, no, because sqrt(g) is sqrt(f^2) = |f|. Since 4 - r² is positive (I think), because if r² is less than 4, then denominator is positive. So f is positive.

Wait, but when is 4 - r² positive? That would be when r < 2. Because r is sqrt(x² + y²), so r <2 implies x² + y² <4. So the metric is defined for r <2, right? Because otherwise, the denominator would be zero or negative, which would cause the metric to blow up or become imaginary.

So the region where this metric makes sense is r <2. So the space is like a disk of radius 2. But what kind of geometry is this? The metric looks like a conformally flat metric on the plane, perhaps a hyperbolic or spherical geometry but in 2D.

Wait, wait. The area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy. So to find the area of the whole space (because the question says pseudosphere of radius 2), I probably need to integrate this area element over the entire domain, which is where r < 2. Oh, but wait, a pseudosphere is an infinite surface, right? Or is it an actual sphere?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing terms here. Pseudosphere usually refers to the tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in 2D, a space with constant negative curvature would have a metric that's similar to the hyperbolic metric. So perhaps this is a hyperbolic plane.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a sphere with a different radius. Wait, the metric is conformally flat, but the denominator is 4 - r². Let me think about the standard metrics. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in 2D polar coordinates is a² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²), but that's for spherical coordinates, which is a bit different.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Gaussian curvature. For a metric of the form ds² = f(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula involving the derivative of f. I remember that for the hyperbolic plane, the metric is f(r) = (1 - (r²)/(4R²)), maybe? Or wait, perhaps it's f(r) = (4R²)/(4R² - r²), which would make it a hyperbolic metric with curvature K = -1/(4R²). Wait, let me get the exact formula.

The standard hyperbolic metric in polar coordinates is ds² = dr² + ( (2R sinh(r/(2R)) ) / (2R) )² dθ². Wait, that's more complicated. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as ds² = (2R)^2/(4R² - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, the metric for the hyperbolic plane can be written in terms of the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk of radius 1. So the curvature is negative, and the area of the whole space is infinite.

Wait, but in our problem, the metric is 32/(4 - r²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see; if I write that as (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), that would be the metric in polar coordinates. So if I compare with the Poincaré disk, which has a denominator like (1 - r²), then perhaps our metric is similar but scaled.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk, the denominator is (1 - r²)^2. Here, the denominator is (4 - r²). So perhaps our f(r) is 32/(4 - r²). Let's compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric.

The formula for the Gaussian curvature K of a metric ds² = e^{2λ(r)} (dr² + r² dθ²) is K = -e^{-2λ} ( λ'' + (λ')² ), where λ' is the derivative with respect to r.

In our case, let me rewrite the metric. Since f(r) = 32/(4 - r²), then ds² = f(r) (dr² + r² dθ²). So e^{2λ} = f(r) = 32/(4 - r²). So λ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

Compute λ', the derivative with respect to r:

λ' = (1/2) [ ( derivative of numerator ) / numerator - (derivative of denominator) / denominator ].

Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Let me compute dλ/dr:

dλ/dr = (1/2) [ d/dr ( ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ) ]

= (1/2) [ 0 - ( (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ]

= (1/2) * (2r/(4 - r²)) )

= r/(4 - r²).

Now λ'' is the derivative of λ' with respect to r:

λ'' = [ (4 - r²)(1) + r(2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2 

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly:

λ' = r/(4 - r²) = r (4 - r²)^(-1)

So derivative of λ' is:

d/dr [ r (4 - r²)^(-1) ] 

= (4 - r²)^(-1) + r * (-1) * (-2r) (4 - r²)^(-2)

= [1/(4 - r²)] + [ 2 r²/(4 - r²)^2 ]

Combine the terms:

= [ (4 - r²) + 2 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2

= (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is:

K = - e^{-2λ} [ λ'' + (λ')^2 ]

Let's compute each term:

e^{-2λ} = [32/(4 - r²)]^{-1} = (4 - r²)/32.

λ'' = (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

(λ')^2 = [ r/(4 - r²) ]^2 = r²/(4 - r²)^2.

So λ'' + (λ')^2 = [ (4 + r²) + r² ] / (4 - r²)^2 

= (4 + 2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

So now,

K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [ (4 + 2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Simplify:

= - [ (4 + 2 r²) / (32 (4 - r²)) ) ]

Factor numerator:

4 + 2 r² = 2(2 + r²)

So,

K = - [ 2(2 + r²) ) / (32 (4 - r²)) ) ]

Simplify 2/32 to 1/16:

= - (2 + r²) / [16 (4 - r²) ]

Hmm, that looks a bit messy. Wait, but for a pseudosphere (tractricoid), I think the Gaussian curvature is constant. Or wait, is a pseudosphere a surface of constant negative curvature?

Wait, the tractricoid (pseudosphere) is a surface of constant negative curvature. So if the Gaussian curvature K is a constant negative value, then the metric would correspond to that.

But in our calculation, K depends on r, which suggests that the curvature isn't constant. That's confusing. So maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should have chosen a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the area is being asked. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, wait, pseudosphere is a 2D surface, but it's an infinite surface, so its area would be infinite. But wait, the options include D) +infty.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the question is about a 2D surface embedded in 3D, but the metric given is 2D. Let me think again.

Wait, the metric given is in two dimensions. So it's a 2D manifold, and the question is about the area of the entire space described by this metric. So the area would be the integral of the area element over all allowed r and θ.

The allowed r is from 0 to 2, since 4 - r² must be positive. So the domain is a disk of radius 2. But the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dr r dθ.

So the area would be the integral over θ from 0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2, of (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ.

Wait, let's compute that.

Area = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the radial integral first:

Integral I = ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r ] / (4 - r²) dr.

Hmm, let's make substitution u = 4 - r².

Then du/dr = -2r => -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So I = 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ 1/u ] (-du/2 )

= 32 * (1/2) ∫ (u=4 to 0) (1/u)
