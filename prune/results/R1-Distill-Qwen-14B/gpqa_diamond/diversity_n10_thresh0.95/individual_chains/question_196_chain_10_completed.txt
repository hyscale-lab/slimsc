Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The given options are A, B, C, D. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things might be different.

Let me recall what I know about harmonic oscillators. In the classical case, a harmonic oscillator has potential energy (1/2)kx² and kinetic energy (1/2)mv². The total energy is conserved, so at the maximum amplitude A, all the energy is potential. Then, when it passes through the equilibrium point, all that potential converts to kinetic, giving maximum speed. The formula I remember is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But this is a relativistic case, so option C might not be the right answer here.

Relativistic speeds... I need to consider special relativity here. The energy equations change because in relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, the system's total energy in relativity would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but in relativity, maybe that's still valid or perhaps modified? Wait, the question says it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential is still (1/2)kx². But the kinetic energy is relativistic.

At the maximum displacement, the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so all the energy is potential. Then, as it moves towards equilibrium, the potential energy converts to kinetic. So the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait a minute. In the classical case, the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA². At maximum displacement, the potential is (1/2)kA² and kinetic is zero. When it's passing through equilibrium, kinetic is E and potential is zero. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So, E = gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Wait, no. The rest mass energy is mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy would be (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because in the classical oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, which at maximum amplitude is all potential. So in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the total energy would be mc² plus the potential energy. Because when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, and the kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, but that might not be correct because in relativity, the potential energy could contribute to the rest mass. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is considered part of the total energy, so the rest mass energy is mc², and the potential adds to that.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation for energy conservation. At maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc². At the equilibrium point, when velocity is maximum, the potential is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic, which is (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but in that case, E = (gamma - 1) mc². So:

(1/2)kA² + mc² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the left side is larger than mc², but the right side would be (gamma -1) times mc². Since gamma is greater than or equal to 1, (gamma -1) is positive, so the right side is positive. Wait, let's rearrange:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc² - mc².

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the equations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. The total energy at any point is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential plus rest mass. So E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, but in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is just (1/2)kA², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in the relativistic case, perhaps the rest energy is included. So E would be (1/2)kA² + mc².

But when the oscillator is moving, at the equilibrium position, the potential is zero, so the kinetic energy is E - mc², which is (1/2)kA².

Wait, but relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So:

(gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So, gamma = 1 + (1/(2 mc²)) kA².

Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, let's denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term. Let me call it 'a' for a moment. So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Wait, but a is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

1 - [1/( (1 + a)^2 ) ] = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding (1 +a)^2 = 1 +2a +a².

So numerator is 2a + a².

Denominator is (1 +a)^2.

So, v²/c² = [ (2a + a²) ] / (1 +a)^2.

But a might be small, but in this case, we can't assume that. So let's write it in terms of a.

v = c * sqrt( [2a + a²] / (1 +a)^2 )

Which is same as c * sqrt( [ a (2 +a) ] ) / (1 +a).

But perhaps we can factor this better. Let me compute it in terms of a.

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator:

[2a + a²] = a(2 + a)

Denominator is (1 +a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a².

So, v²/c² = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + 2a + a²).

Hmm. Let me try substituting a back.

a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, substituting a into the expression:

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ) ] / [ 1 + 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

Let me write it as:

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ]

= (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of expanding, I should express the equation in terms of a.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me get back to the equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So,

gamma = [ (2 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² )

But gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so:

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = [2 m c² + k A²]/(2 m c² )

Taking reciprocal of both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 2 m c² / (2 m c² + k A² )

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ]

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ (4 m² c^4) / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ) ]

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me compute denominator:

Denominator is (2 m c² + k A²)^2 = [2 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 = (2 m c²)^2 (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

So, the fraction becomes [4 m² c^4 ] / [4 m² c^4 (1 + a)^2 ] where a is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + a)^2 ]

Which brings us back to an earlier expression.

Wait, but earlier I tried another approach and got v²/c² as [a (2 + a)] / (1 + a)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should express the equation for v_max in terms of the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option B) v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Wait, let's compute that.

Inside the square root:

1 + 1/(1 - b ), where b = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

= [ (1 - b) + 1 ] / (1 - b )

= (2 - b ) / (1 - b )

So sqrt( (2 - b)/(1 - b) ) times c.

Hmm, doesn't match my expression. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should express 1/(1 - v^2/c^2 ) in terms of gamma.

Wait, another approach: energy.

The total energy when the oscillator is at maximum displacement is E = (1/2)kA^2 + mc^2.

At equilibrium, all that energy becomes kinetic plus rest mass.

Wait, no: in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc^2, and the potential is (1/2)kx². So at maximum displacement, x = A. So E = (1/2)kA² + mc² = (gamma -1) mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't zero when velocity is zero. Or is it?

Wait, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the total energy would be E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

When it's at equilibrium, x=0, so potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2)kA². But wait, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So,

(gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Taking reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ]

Square both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ]^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)) )^2 ]

Hmm, that's the expression I arrived at earlier.

Wait, let me compute this expression.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c^2) as 'a'. So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2.

= [ (1 + a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2.

= [1 + 2a + a² -1 ] / (1 + a )^2.

= (2a + a²)/(1 + a )^2.

= a (2 + a ) / (1 + a )^2.

So, v = c * sqrt( a (2 + a ) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Looking back at the options, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, let's compute what I have.

Wait, I have v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a )^2], where a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ]

Which can be written as [ (1 + a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2.

Simplify numerator:

(1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a )^2.

But let's see what each option gives.

Looking at option D:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 ] )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ]

Which is exactly what I have.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ]

Which is the same as what I derived.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

Which is exactly option D.

Wait, no. Let me read option D again.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the correct expression is option D.

Wait, but looking back, I thought option C was the classical, but in this relativistic case, option D is correct.

So, the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we use relativistic energy conservation principles. The total energy of the system at maximum displacement is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy, given by:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At equilibrium (where the oscillator has maximum speed), all the energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy:

\[
E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Thus, the maximum speed is:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy conservation framework.

Answer: D
