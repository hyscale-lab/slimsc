Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see what the clues are.

The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, but maybe something else. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring? Because aromatic rings can have absorption around 1600 cm⁻¹, but 1650 is a bit higher. Could it be conjugated carbonyls?

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. That suggests maybe an ester, because esters have both a carbonyl and an alkene if it's an unsaturated ester. Or maybe a ketone with a double bond nearby.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2O, which would be from an ether, but wait, maybe another possibility. Alternatively, it could be from an acetate group because 45 is the mass of CH3COO- (which is 12+16+12+16+1= 57? Wait, no. Let me calculate: CH3COO⁻ would be (12*2) + (1*3) + (16*2) = 24 +3 +32=59? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, 45 is 45. Let me think: 45 could be from something like (CH2)2O, but that's 12*2 + 2*1 +16 = 24 +2 +16=42. No. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH3CO (which is 43, since 12+16+12+1 = 41? Wait, no, CH3CO has a mass of 43: C=12, H3=3, C=12, O=16. 12+3 +12 +16=43. So maybe a fragment from CH3CO-something. Alternatively, another possibility.

Wait, maybe the m/z 45 is from a different source. Let's think: 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), which is a common fragment, but that's 91 for the benzene ring. No, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the methyl ester group. Wait, another approach: calculate the degree of unsaturation for the possible formulas.

The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N.

For each option:

Option A: C6H12O → C=6, H=12, O=1.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

Option B: C6H10O → DoU is (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2 → (14-10 -2*16? Wait, no, O doesn't affect DoU. H is 10, O=2. So DoU = (14-10)/2= 2. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O2 → (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

But looking at the NMR, it has vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. So the compound must have at least one double bond, which would account for one DoU. So options with at least one DoU. Let's check:

A: DoU 1 → possible (if a ring or a double bond)
B: DoU 2 → could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.
C: DoU 2 → same as B
D: DoU 1 → same as A

Now, the IR. A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests O-H stretch. So maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the O-H is usually broader. But wait, the other peak at 1700 could be a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone. So if the compound is an ester, which would have a carbonyl around 1700, and maybe an alcohol group if it's a glycol ester or something else. Wait, no, esters typically don't have O-H groups because they are formed from an acid and an alcohol. Unless it's a hemiacetal or something, but that's less likely.

Wait, but the FTIR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Let me think, 1700 is a carbonyl. 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (like an enone). So maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

In that case, the structure would have a double bond next to a carbonyl.

Looking at the options, the molecular formulas:

Wait, let's think about functional groups. The presence of O-H (from IR), carbonyl (1700), and vinyl hydrogens (NMR) suggests maybe a compound with both an alcohol group and a carbonyl, perhaps an ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond. But carboxylic acids have O-H that is usually broad, which matches the IR. But then, why the NMR has vinyl Hs? So maybe a conjugated dien? Hmm.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is more characteristic of an alcohol O-H than a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak, but perhaps in this case, it's similar.

So perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond nearby. Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H would come from where? Oh, wait, maybe it's not an ester but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an alcohol group. But that's less common.

Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but perhaps I'm complicating.

Looking at the mass spec: m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ which is 58? Wait, no. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think of possible structures.

If the compound is an ester, like CH3CO-O-R, then the ester group would break in certain ways. For example, the ester can lose the R-O- group, leaving the acylium ion, which would have a mass of 45 if R is methyl. Wait, but if R is larger, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 15 (CH3) + 16 (O) + something? No, wait, (CH3)2O is 45? Let's calculate:

Carbon (12) * 2 = 24, Hydrogen (1*6=6?), Oxygen (16). So 24+6+16=46. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, (CH3)2O is 45?

Wait, (CH3)2O is dimethyl ether, CH3OCH3. Its molecular weight is (12*2) + (6*1) + 16 = 24+6+16=46. So 46. But the fragment is at 45, so maybe not that.

Wait, what about CH3CO+? That would be 43. Alternatively, maybe CH3CO-O- as part of a larger structure.

Wait, another possibility: 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's the acetylium ion, which is CH3CO+. That's 43. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a different part.

Wait, maybe the fragment corresponds to a ketone. For example, if the molecule is something like cyclohexanone, but that's C6H10O. The mass would be 102 (12*6 + 10 +16=72+10+16=98). Wait, but the fragment is at 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a larger substituent. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C is C6H10O2. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygen. The formula could be an ester, like ethyl propionate or something else. Wait, ethyl propionate is C3H6O2. No, our compound is C6H10O2. Maybe it's something like methyl pentanoate, but that's C6H12O2. Wait, no, methyl pentanoate is CH3(CH2)3COOCH3, which is C6H12O2. So that's option A.

But wait, the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H. So maybe it's not a simple ester, but perhaps a glycol ester or something else with an alcohol group.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But in that case, the O-H would be from the lactone, but lactones have an ester group and maybe an O-H. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the presence of two carbonyl peaks in IR, 1700 and 1650. Could it be a conjugated system? Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would have a conjugated system where the carbonyl is at 1700 and the conjugated double bond is at 1650.

So maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOR. That would have the conjugated double bond and the ester carbonyl.

Looking at the options, the molecular formulas. Let's see:

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's see: if it's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate), that would be C5H8O2. Hmm, no. Wait, that's five carbons; our options have six. Alternatively, maybe something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester or a more complex structure.

Wait, but let's get back to the mass spectrum. If the fragment is at m/z 45, perhaps it comes from a part of the molecule with molecular weight 45. Like a methyl group attached to something else.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a group. For example, the ester group could break, releasing the R-O- group and leaving the acylium ion. If the acyl part is, say, CH2CO, which has a molecular weight of 44 (12+16+12 + 16= 44?), wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH3COO) losing something.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from CH3CO-O- which is 59, but that doesn't match 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something. Or maybe it's a CH2CH2O fragment, which would be 44, but again, not 45.

Wait, maybe the compound has a methyl ester group. Because the fragment at 45 would correspond to the methyl ester's loss. Wait, but the m/z is 45, which is 12+16+17? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a larger group, leaving a smaller fragment. Suppose the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate). Its molecular weight would be (CH2=CHCOO) is 72 (3 carbons, 4 H, 2 O). Wait, no, let me calculate:

Acrylate: CH2=CHCOO- is 62 g/mol (each C is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So 3 C's (36) + 4 H (4) + 2 O (32) → 72? No wait, (CH2=CHCOO-) is 62: 3 C's (36) + 4 H (4) + 2 O (32) → 36+4+32=72? Wait no, 3 C in the acrylate group: CH2=CHCOO- is three carbons, but wait, the formula is CH2=CHCOO-R. So the molecular weight would be 72 (CH2=CHCOO) plus the R group.

If R is methyl, then the molecular weight is 72+31 (CH3) → 103. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of the ester group. Let's say the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. That would have an ester and an alcohol group. Then, perhaps the ester breaks off, leaving the alcohol part. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol ester, but that's getting more complicated.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For instance, gamma-butyrolactone is a four-membered ring. Its structure is cyclic ester, so it has a carbonyl and an oxygen. But that's C4H6O2, which isn't matching our options.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have the conjugated carbonyl.

Now, let's think about the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. So 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. That could correspond to an ester, maybe with a double bond (since we have vinyl Hs in NMR) and an O-H group.

Wait, so maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's see: that's 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens. Wait, no, because I have eight hydrogens here. Hmm, let's count:

CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3: 

CH2=CHCH2: 5 H (since each CH2 is 2 H, but the double bond has two CH2 groups, but I'm getting confused. Let me count each carbon:

- CH2=CH-: each CH2 has 2 H, but since it's a double bond, the structure is CH2-CH2? No, wait, it's CH2-CH2 with a double bond in between. Or perhaps CH2=CH-.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: let's write down the molecular formula for each option and see what structure is possible.

Option C: C6H10O2.

The molecular formula is C6H10O2.

This could be an ester, which has the formula RCOOR', where R and R' are carbon chains. The general formula for an ester is (n + m) carbons, (2n + 2m + 2) hydrogens, and 2 oxygen atoms.

Wait, no, the general formula for an ester RCOOR' is Cn+1m+1 H2(n + m +1) O2. Wait, maybe not exactly; let me think.

Wait, R is an alkyl group with n carbons, R' is an alkyl with m carbons. Then, RCOOR' would be (n+1) carbons in the acid part and (m) in the alcohol part. So total carbons: (n+1 + m) = n + m +1.

So for option C, C6H10O2. So n + m +1 =6 → n + m=5. The hydrogens: the ester formula would be (2n + 2m + 2) ? Or maybe not exactly.

Wait, the acid part RCOOH has 2n+1 H in the alkyl chain. The ester RCOOR' would have (2n+1) H from R and (2m) H from R' (since R' is an alkyl from an alcohol like R'OH). So total H would be 2n+1 + 2m.

So for the ester, H = 2n + 2m +1.

But wait, the ester's structure is RCOOR', which is (n+1) carbons from the acid and m from the alcohol.

So H would be 2n + 1 (from R) + (2m -1) (from R')? Because the R' in the ester is R'O- so it's (m) carbons with (2m) H (if it's a straight chain). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula for an ester is Cn+m+2 H2n+2m+2 O2. Wait, not sure.

But in our case, C6H10O2. Let's see possible esters:

If it's an ester, n + m +1 =6 → n + m=5.

Hydrogens: Let's say for a simple ester, like methyl pentanoate: CH3(CH2)3COOCH3. That's C6H12O2. But our option C is C6H10O2, so it's missing two hydrogens. So maybe the ester has a double bond.

Ah! So perhaps the ester has an unsaturated group. Like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would be:

CH2=CHCOO has 4 carbons (CH2=CHCOO-) which would be the acid part (n=3, because R is CH2CH2COO?), and the R' is CH2CH2CH3 (m=3).

Wait, no, let me count the carbons:

CH2=CHCOO- is three carbons (from the acid part: RCOO- where R is CH2=CHCH2-?), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. But that would have an O-H group as well, matching the IR.

Wait, but let's think about the molecular formula.

If the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH, then:

CH2=CHCOO- is 3 carbons (CH2=CH-COO-)
CH2CH2OH is 2 carbons (CH2CH2OH is actually CH2CH2OH, but that's two carbons, so m=2.

Wait, that would be n=3 (for the acid part) and m=2 (for the alcohol part). So n + m +1 = 3 +2 +1=6, which matches the C6.

Hydrogens: The acid part, CH2=CHCOO-: Let's count. CH2=CHCOO-:

CH2=CH- (two carbons, 3 H each for CH2 and 1 H for CH in the double bond: 3 +1 =4 H) and COO- has two O's. Then the ester part would have CH2CH2OH:

Wait, no, the R' is CH2CH2OH, which is actually CH2CH2OH → that's two carbons, but the structure would be OCH2CH2OH?

No, wait, the ester is formed from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. So if the acid is CH2=CHCOOH, and the alcohol is HOCH2CH2CH2OH? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, let's try to calculate the molecular formula for CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH.

CH2=CHCOO: C3H3O2 (since CH2=CHCOO has 3 C, 3 H (CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1, and COO has 0, but maybe I'm missing some).

Wait, perhaps it's better to count all the atoms.

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH:

Carbon: 3 (from CH2=CHCOO) + 2 (from CH2CH2OH) =5? No, wait:

CH2=CHCOO is 3 C, O is 2.

OCH2CH2OH is 2 C's in the OCH2CH2 part, and an OH. So total C: 3 +2=5. But we need 6 C. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That's an ester, ethyl acrylate. Wait, molecular formula:

CH2=CHCOO is 3 C, O is 2. CH2CH2CH3 is 3 C. So total C=6. Hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO has 3 H (CH2 has 2, CH has 1, O's don't add H). The CH2CH2CH3 has 6 H (each CH2 has 2 H, but the end CH3 has 3 H). So 3 + 6 =9 H. But the formula is C6H10O2, which has 10 H. So where's the missing H?

Wait, no, let's recount:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: 

CH2=CHCOO-: 

CH2=CH- group: 2 H (on CH2) + 1 H (on CH) =3 H.

COO-: the carbonyl doesn't add H, so that's 3 H from the CH2=CH.

Then, the ester group OCH2CH2CH3: O connected to CH2CH2CH3, which has 2 CH2 groups and a CH3.

Each CH2 has 2 H each, and the CH3 has 3 H.

So OCH2CH2CH3: each CH2 has 2 H, so 2*2=4 H, plus CH3's 3 H: total 7 H.

So the entire molecule would have 3 (from CH2=CH) + 7 (from OCH2CH2CH3) =10 H. So the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which matches option C.

So the structure would be ethyl acrylate, but wait, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Wait, that's correct:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 → C6H10O2.

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, the IR: The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H. Wait, but ethyl acrylate is an ester, which doesn't have an O-H group. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the IR suggests O-H, but the ester doesn't have that. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the compound isn't an ester but something else. Let me think again.

Another possibility: the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. But then, the IR would have a broad O-H and a strong carbonyl peak. But then the NMR would show vinyl Hs, implying a double bond. So maybe a cyclohexanone with an adjacent alcohol group?

Wait, but cyclohexanone is C6H10O. So that's option B: C6H10O. But does that fit the IR and NMR?

The FTIR would have a broad O-H from the alcohol. The 1700 would be the ketone (cyclohexanone) and 1650 maybe from conjugation or an aromatic ring, but cyclohexanone doesn't have that. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alpha-hydroxy ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the compound could be a beta-keto ester. Like ethyl acetoacetate. Its structure is CH3COCH2COOCH2CH3. That's C6H10O3. Wait, but our options don't have O3. So that's out.

Another option: maybe the compound is a diol with a conjugated ester or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a hemiacetal. But I'm not very familiar with how that would affect the IR.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has both an ester and an alcohol group. For example, a glycolic ester. But that would require the formula to have more oxygens, perhaps.

Wait, let me think about the mass spec again. If the fragment is at 45, perhaps it's from a group with molecular weight 45. Let's think about that.

If the compound is C6H10O2, what parts could break off to give a 45 fragment? Maybe a (CH3)2CO group, but 45 is 45, which doesn't fit. Wait, (CH3)2CO is 58 (12*3 + 1*6 +16= 36+6+16=58). Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe a CH3COO group. That's 43 (12+16+12 +16= 56?), no, 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) *3? Wait, no, CH3COO has two carbons, three H's, and two O's. So molecular weight is (12*2) + (3) + (16*2) = 24 +3 +32=59. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe the fragment is from a different part. Another possibility is that the 45 comes from a benzene ring, but that's 78. So not that.

Wait, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester, but then the NMR would probably show aromatic protons, which the question doesn't mention. The NMR only mentions vinyl Hs, so probably an alkene.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an O-H group. For example, a gamma or delta lactone. But let's see:

Gamma-butyrolactone is C4H6O2. Our options have C6. So maybe a larger lactone. For example, C6H10O2 could be a lactone with 6 carbons.

But how would the IR look? The lactone would have an ester carbonyl around 1700. The O-H would be from the lactone, but in lactones, the O-H is usually part of the ring and might not show a broad peak. Or maybe it would. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an orthoester, but that's probably too complex.

Wait, another approach: let's look at all the clues again.

IR:
- Broad peak at 3000 → O-H stretch (alcohol or carboxylic acid)
- 1700 cm⁻¹ → carbonyl (C=O)
- 1650 cm⁻¹ → possibly conjugated carbonyl or double bond.

NMR:
- Peaks for vinyl Hs → double bond present.

Mass spec:
- Fragment at m/z 45.

Possible structures: a compound with O-H, C=O, and a double bond.

Options:

A) C6H12O2 → DoU 1. Could be an ester without double bonds, but we have vinyl Hs, so must have a double bond. So this option is unlikely.

B) C6H10O → DoU 2. Could be a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. But the IR suggests O-H and carbonyl, so maybe a ketone with an alcohol group.

C) C6H10O2 → DoU 2. Could be an ester with a double bond (like ethyl acrylate) but earlier that didn't fit the O-H. Alternatively, a diol ester or something else.

D) C6H12O → DoU 1. Maybe an alcohol with a ring or a double bond, but again, if it's a simple ester, no O-H. But O-H is present.

Wait, if option C is C6H10O2, which could be an ester with a double bond and an O-H group. But earlier, I thought that the ester wouldn't have an O-H. Unless it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a diacid ester. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a substituted acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), but that's more complex.

Alternatively, let's think about the IR. If the broad peak is from an O-H, and the other peaks are from two carbonyls, maybe it's a dicarboxylic acid. But then, the NMR would show more protons from the acid, but the question says NMR shows vinyl Hs, so there's a double bond.

Wait, another approach: considering the mass spec. If the fragment is at 45, that's 45 amu. Possible sources of a 45 fragment could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+) at 91. No. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a larger group, leaving a 45 fragment. For example, if the compound is something like R-O-CO-O-R', and upon fragmentation, it breaks into a 45 fragment.

Wait, perhaps the 45 comes from a CH3COO- group losing a CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O- group, but that's 44, which would be close if there's an extra H.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketene, which has a mass of 45? Not sure.

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to piece together the clues again.

1. O-H (broad peak) → so compound has an O-H group.

2. C=O (1700) → so a carbonyl group.

3. Another peak at 1650 → maybe conjugated C=O or an aromatic ring. But since NMR shows vinyl Hs, more likely a conjugated C=C.

4. NMR shows vinyl Hs → double bond present.

5. Mass spec has a 45 fragment.

Looking for a structure with O-H, C=O, C=C.

Possibly a compound like a cinnamic acid derivative. Cinnamic acid is C9H8O2, but our options are C6. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe a substituted acrylic acid with an ester group. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: calculate the molecular weight for each option to see if 45 makes sense as a fragment.

Option C is C6H10O2 → molecular weight = (6×12)+(10×1)+(2×16)=72+10+32=114.

So the molecular ion would be around 114. If a fragment is at 45, which is roughly a third of that, perhaps it's a loss of a larger group.

How would a 45 fragment form? Maybe the molecule breaks into a smaller part. Let's see:

If the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH, which is C6H10O3, but that's not an option. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from the cleavage of the ester group, leaving a carbonyl group.

Wait, another idea: the 45 fragment could be the loss of a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO) which has a mass of 58. No, that's not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the result of a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in mass spectrometry for ketones. McLafferty rearrangement produces a fragment that is typically (M - H2O - H2) for ketones. But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the cleavage of the C-O bond in an ester. For example, in an ester RCOOR', if the R' group is broken off, the remaining part would be RCOO+, which would have a mass of (RCOO+) = (R's mass) +43. If the R' group's mass is 2 (like CH3), then 43+2=45. So the fragment would be CH3COO+ → mass 59? No, wait, CH3COO is 59. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, wait, maybe the R' is a methyl group. So the ester is RCOOCH3. The molecular weight is (RCOOCH3) = M. If the molecule breaks at the ester oxygen, the fragment would be CH3O+ (31) and RCOO+ (RCOO+ has a mass of M - 31). If M is 114, then RCOO+ would be 83. So 83 isn't 45.

Alternatively, another cleavage point. Maybe the ester breaks into RCOO- and R'OH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a group with a molecular weight of (M -45). For example, if the molecule loses a group of 69 (114-45=69), which could be a propyl group (C3H7, which is 57), but that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a secondary ion, like a CH2=CHCOO group. Wait, CH2=CHCOO has a molecular weight of 72. Not 45.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another angle.

The presence of a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond (from NMR) suggests the structure might have an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. So, the structure is likely an enone or an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Let me think about the IR again. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates a strong O-H. So, if the structure has an O-H and a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps it's a dienol ester or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible compounds matching the options.

Option C: C6H10O2. The formula could correspond to an ester with a double bond, but also an O-H group. So maybe it's a diol ester or something with both groups.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester. For example, ethyl acetoacetate is CH3COCH2COOCH2CH3, which is C6H10O3. But that has three oxygen atoms, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted propenoate ester with an O-H group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH, but that's C6H10O3 again.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a diester, but that would require more oxygen. Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an O-H group. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a substituted benzaldehyde with an O-H, but that would require aromatic protons in the NMR, which aren't mentioned.

Wait, maybe the FTIR's 1650 cm⁻¹ is from an aromatic ring. But the NMR only mentions vinyl Hs, not aromatic. So perhaps it's a conjugated diene, not an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, the 1650 is from a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Wait, considering all this, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an O-H group. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a hydroxyl group attached to the ester, making it a glycolic ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a coumarin derivative, but that's probably more complex.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of a cyclic structure. Like a cyclic hemiacetal.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a hydroxyl group attached to the ester, making it a hemiacetal ester.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → molecular weight 114, DoU 1
B) C6H10O → molecular weight 98, DoU 2
C) C6H10O2 → molecular weight 114, DoU 2
D) C6H12O → molecular weight 98, DoU 1

Looking at the molecular weight:

If the compound has a molecular weight of 114 (options A and C), and the fragment is 45, that's a significant portion. So perhaps the 45 is a cleavage product of a larger group.

Assuming the compound is an ester, like RCOOR', the ester group could cleave into RCOO+ and R'OH. If RCOO+ is 45, then R would be something with a molecular weight of 45- (16 + 12 +16) ? Wait, RCOO+ is 45. RCOO+ has a formula of RCOO+, so R is (45 - (12 +16 +16 )) = 45-44=1? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps R is CH3, so RCOO is CH3COO, which is 59. So that's not matching 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group, leaving a smaller fragment. For example, if the molecule loses a fragment of molecular weight 69 (114-45=69), which could be something like C4H9O or similar.

But I'm not sure what would fragment to give 45.

Another possibility: the 45 fragment is from a ketene group, which has a molecular formula O=C=O. But that's 44, and the fragment is 45. Hmm, close but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a group, leaving a CH2CH2O group, which is 44. But the fragment is 45, so that's not matching.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something. Wait, if the fragment is (CH3)2O, which is 46, but the fragment is 45. Close, but not exact.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to think about the possible structures for each option and see which fits.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's suppose it's ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3), which is C6H10O2. But that structure doesn't have an O-H group, so the IR broad peak wouldn't be explained.

Wait, but what if it's a modified version, like a substituted acrylate with an O-H group. For example, if the ester has an adjacent hydroxyl group.

But that would change the formula. So maybe it's a diol ester, but that would require more oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with an O-H, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of two carbonyl peaks in IR suggests two different carbonyl groups, perhaps a ketone and an ester. But that would require more oxygens.

Wait, but option C has two oxygens, so two carbonyls would fit.

So, perhaps the structure is something like a diketone, but that would require two ketone groups, which would also fit the DoU.

But then the NMR would have peaks for the ketone's alpha hydrogens, but the question mentions vinyl Hs. So maybe not.

Wait, another thought: the two carbonyl peaks could be from an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester (conjugated) and another carbonyl group, like a ketone. But that would require more oxygens.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the information.

The presence of a broad O-H peak suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The conjugated carbonyl and vinyl Hs suggest a double bond near a carbonyl. The mass spec shows a 45 fragment, which could correspond to a small group like (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether) but that's 46. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a larger group losing something else.

But given the options, the most plausible structure that fits the O-H, conjugated carbonyl, and vinyl Hs is option C: C6H10O2. Because it can support both an O-H group (like a diol ester) and a conjugated carbonyl with a double bond.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not 100% confident.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data: FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The analysis of the data is as follows:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
   - Strong peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of carbonyl groups. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak likely corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O), while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a conjugated carbonyl or a double bond.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a small fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This could correspond to a group such as (CH₃)₂O or a related fragment.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: This formula has a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 1, which could correspond to a ring or a double bond. However, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR and the need for a conjugated system make this option less likely.
   - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: This formula has a DoU of 2, which could correspond to a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. However, it lacks the required oxygen for both a carbonyl and an O-H group, making it inconsistent with the IR data.
   - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: This formula has a DoU of 2, which can accommodate a conjugated carbonyl system (e.g., an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester) and an O-H group. The molecular weight of 114 is consistent with the mass spectrum, and the fragment at m/z = 45 could arise from the cleavage of a larger group.
   - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: This formula has a DoU of 1, which is insufficient to account for the conjugated carbonyl system and the double bond indicated by the NMR and IR data.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The most plausible structure is **C₆H₁₀O₂**, which can accommodate both an O-H group and a conjugated carbonyl system. The fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with the cleavage of a larger group, supporting this option.
