Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries.

Let me think about each of these symmetries. I know that the Standard Model includes certain symmetries, and effective theories usually extend or work within those constraints.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Oh right, the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT, being an effective theory built from it, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT must be a Lorentz scalar because they're constructed from the Standard Model fields. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if a theory is Lorentz invariant, it's usually also Poincare invariant because the fields can be translated. But wait, could there be a situation where Poincare isn't respected? Well, in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they should respect Poincare. So I think Poincare symmetry must also be respected. So options that include both 1 and 2 might be correct.

Now, CP symmetry. CP is Charge conjugation plus Parity. But I recall that the Standard Model isn't CP symmetric. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So in SMEFT, operators can violate CP because the Standard Model already does. So it's not required for SMEFT operators to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 isn't a must.

CPT symmetry. Hmm, I think the Standard Model is CPT symmetric. Because CPT includes Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. Wait, but in quantum field theory, all Lorentz-invariant theories are expected to be CPT symmetric. Because the LSZ formula and the way fields are quantized require it. So if the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must automatically respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must conserve CPT symmetry. So 4 is a must.

Wait, but wait! Are there any exceptions? For example, if an operator has a certain structure that could violate CPT? I'm not sure. But I think in general, Lorentz symmetry implies CPT symmetry. Because the CPT theorem says that any Lorentz-invariant theory (with some other conditions, like the existence of a Hermitian Hamiltonian) must obey CPT symmetry. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, then it must respect CPT. So symmetry 4 is a must.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but wait: do all SMEFT operators respect Poincare? Because operators are local, so yes, they should. But let me think again. Are there any SMEFT operators that don't respect Poincare? I don't think so. Because they are constructed as local operators.

Wait, but the question is about operators in SMEFT. So the options are which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So 1, 2, and 4 are required.

Looking back at the options, the choices are:

Option C:1,2,4. That's Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

Option D:1,3,4. That includes CP which is not a must.

So the correct answer must be option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question is asking which of these symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must individually respect all of these symmetries, right?

Wait, but Poincare symmetry includes both translations and Lorentz. But the operators in SMEFT are terms in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant. So yes, each term must be a Poincare scalar. So 2 must be respected.

So the correct answer is that 1, 2, and 4 are required. So option C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM) is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is constructed as an effective theory respecting the symmetries of the SM. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT operators are local and constructed from SM fields, they must respect Poincaré symmetry. Any violation of Poincaré symmetry would imply non-locality, which is not the case in SMEFT.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP symmetry, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT symmetric, and Lorentz-invariant theories are generally expected to respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
