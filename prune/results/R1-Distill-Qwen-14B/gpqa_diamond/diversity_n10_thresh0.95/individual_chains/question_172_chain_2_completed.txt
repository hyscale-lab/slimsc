Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, no, actually, it says the specific energy level is twice as excited. So maybe it's about the population of that energy level being higher in star_1.

The energy difference between the levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's the same as k (Boltzmann's constant) because k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Interesting.

The question is about finding the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2. The options are A to D, all involving ln(2) and some combination of T1 and T2.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population ratio of two energy levels. The formula is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, in this case, though, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. I'm assuming that the specific energy level is in question, so the population of that level is higher. So maybe the ratio of the populations in star_1 compared to star_2 is 2. Let me think: for star_1, the population is n1, star_2 is n2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

Using the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE (1/(k T2) - 1/(k T1)) ) ) because when you divide exponents, you subtract. Alternatively, wait, maybe I should write it as (n1 / n2) = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). But in this case, assuming the same energy levels are being compared, maybe the statistical weights (g) are the same? The question says it's a specific energy level, so perhaps the statistical weights are the same for both stars. So the ratio simplifies to exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), but wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's correct that. The Boltzmann factor for two states is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So if both stars are comparing the same two energy levels, then g_upper and g_lower are the same for both. So the ratio becomes (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

But in this problem, the question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Wait, perhaps the question is comparing the number of atoms in a particular excited state? Or maybe the excitation is the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

So perhaps the fraction (n1) of excited atoms in that level is twice as much as in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2. But wait, no, because the ratio depends on temperature. Let's think: for each star, the population in the energy level is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, for star 1, n1 = n2 * exp(ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)) ), because when you take the ratio n1/n2 = exp(ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ), because the exponent is for star 2 minus star 1.

Wait, maybe I should write it more carefully. Let's denote the energy difference as ΔE. For each star, the population of the excited state is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for star 1, population is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). 

The question states that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2. But wait, actually, n1 depends on T1, and n2 on T2. So n1 / n2 = 2. 

But wait, actually, the number of atoms in a certain energy level is proportional to g * exp( -E/(k T) ), where E is the energy of the level. So if the two stars are being compared for the same level, then the ratio is (g1 exp(-E1/(k T1))) / (g2 exp(-E2/(k T2)))). But wait, if E1 and E2 are the same energy level, then E1 = E2, so E1 - E2 = 0, which can't be. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the two stars have their own energy levels, but for the same transition? Or maybe the energy levels are different. Wait no, the problem says the energy difference between the considered levels is the same (1.38e-23 J) for both stars. So ΔE is the same for both.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the ratio of the populations in the same energy level (say, level E1 for star 1 and level E2 for star 2) is twice as much in star 1. But that seems not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the population of a higher energy level relative to a lower is twice as much in star 1 compared to star 2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So for star_1, ratio R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1, and for star_2, R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2. The problem says R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, in LTE, the ratio R is given by (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for each star, the ratio R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming same g factors. So R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So R1 = 2 R2.

That would be the case if the question is about the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. So substituting, exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), so exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2.

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )) ) = 2.

Taking natural log on both sides: ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ) = ln(2).

But wait, I can factor this: (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So substituting ΔE = k into the equation:

k/k (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2) → (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2). Let's rearrange: 1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2). Hmm, but the question is about the relation between T1 and T2. Let's see.

Wait, I think I might have a sign error. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the equation R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

So R1 = 2 R2 → exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), get exp(ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ) = 2.

So exponent is ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Since ΔE = k, substituting:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) (k / k ) = ln(2) → (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

But wait, that would mean 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2). Hmm, but that's not one of the options directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write this as 1/T1 - 1/T2 = - ln(2).

Wait, wait, let me redo the math.

We have:

exp( (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Take ln of both sides:

(ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

But since ΔE = k,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Which can be written as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

So that would be option D.

Wait, but according to my equation, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). So ln(2) equals (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2), which is option D.

Wait, but in the earlier steps, I thought it would be 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2), which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2). So that's correct.

So the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let me think about the sign again.

Wait, from the equation: 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Which is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So yes, that's correct. So the equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Yes, that's exactly what I derived. So option D is correct.


The problem involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, which is equal to Boltzmann's constant (k). The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population of energy levels in a star's photosphere to its temperature.

The Boltzmann factor for the population ratio of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_{\text{upper}}\) and \(n_{\text{lower}}\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, respectively, and \(T\) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the populations of the specific energy level are proportional to \(\exp(-\Delta E / kT_1)\) and \(\exp(-\Delta E / kT_2)\), respectively.

The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = 2.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann factors, we have:

\[
\frac{\exp(-\Delta E / kT_1)}{\exp(-\Delta E / kT_2)} = 2.
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k\), this simplifies to:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
