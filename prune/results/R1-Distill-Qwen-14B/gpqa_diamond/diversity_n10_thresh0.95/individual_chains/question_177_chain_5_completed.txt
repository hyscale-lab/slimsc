Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the problem is about the luminosities of two stars. Let me jot down the key points:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 M2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So their peak emission wavelengths are equal.
- Radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that factors into the luminosity calculation. Oh wait, the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, so maybe the velocities affect the observed wavelength, but since the peak emission is the same, perhaps we're considering their rest wavelengths. Or maybe it's a redshift thing, but the question is about their intrinsic luminosity, so maybe the velocity doesn't directly affect the luminosity calculation. Hmm, I might come back to that.

The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35. So the factor is a bit more than 2.25.

First, I need to recall the formula for luminosity of a star. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So I can use that formula. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

The problem states that their peak wavelengths are the same. Wait, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is determined by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. If λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2. Oh, so their temperatures are equal.

Wait, but if they have the same peak emission wavelength, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. So their temperatures are equal.

But wait, I need to make sure: the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that would be their λ_max, right? So yes, same temperature.

So now, since L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same for both, the ratio L1/L2 is (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But T1 = T2, so that term is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Then (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be 2.25. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has zero radial velocity, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect anything? Because when a star moves towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. Could that affect the observed wavelength, but the problem says the peak wavelengths they "appeared" brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same. So maybe the actual λ_max is different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same. Hmm, but the question states that the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies, so perhaps the velocity affects the observed temperature.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. The problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on the black body assumption. So the L is intrinsic, not considering any Doppler shift. Because if the star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, but the question is about the actual luminosity, not the observed. Or maybe the problem is saying that the peak wavelengths observed are the same, which could mean that their rest wavelengths are different but Doppler shifted to the same observed λ_max. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, if the stars have the same observed λ_max, but Star_2 is moving away (velocity 700 km/s, which is positive, so maybe redshifted?), then the rest wavelength of Star_2 would be longer. So the actual T would be lower than what is observed.

But wait, no, wait: if a star is moving away from us, its light is redshifted. So the observed λ_max would be longer, implying a lower temperature. If Star_2 is moving away (700 km/s), its observed λ_max would be longer than its actual λ_max. But the problem says that they have the same observed λ_max. So if Star_1 has zero velocity, its observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. Star_2 is moving away, so its observed λ_max is longer than its rest λ_max. But the problem states both have the same observed λ_max. So that would mean that Star_2's rest λ_max is shorter than the observed, because it's moving away, making the observed longer. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer. So to have the same observed λ_max as Star_1, which isn't moving, Star_2's rest λ_max must be shorter than Star_1's. Because when you redshift, λ increases. So if the observed λ_max for Star_2 is same as Star_1's, but Star_2 is moving away, its actual (rest) λ_max must be shorter.

Wait, that might change the T calculation. Because, using observed λ_max, we have T_observed = b / λ_observed. But the actual T of Star_2 would be higher because λ_rest = λ_observed * (1 + v/c), but wait, v is the radial velocity. Hmm.

Wait, let's think. The Doppler effect formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away (redshift). So for Star_2, v = 700 km/s. Let's calculate the Doppler shift.

First, c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So v/c is 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333... So (1 + v/c) is about 1.002333.

So λ_rest for Star_2 is λ_observed / (1.002333). So it's a little less than λ_observed. So the rest wavelength is smaller, which implies higher temperature. Because λ is inversely proportional to T.

So T_rest = b / λ_rest. Since λ_rest = λ_obs / (1 + v/c), then T_rest = b * (1 + v/c) / λ_obs = T_observed * (1 + v/c). Because T_obs = b / λ_obs.

So for Star_1, since it's not moving, T1 = T_obs. For Star_2, T2_rest = T_obs * (1 + v/c). Because it's moving away, so the observed wavelength is longer than the rest, so rest temperature is higher.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. So when calculating their luminosity, we would use their actual temperatures, not the observed. So L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So for Star_1, L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ (T1)^4. For Star_2, L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ (T2)^4.

Wait, but T1 is the observed temperature, but T2 is the rest temperature. Because Star_2 is moving away, its observed T would be lower than its rest T. Because the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so observed T is T_obs = T_rest / (1 + v/c). So T_rest = T_obs * (1 + v/c).

Wait, no. Let me correct that. From the Doppler shift:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) [v positive for moving away]

Since λ_max = b / T, then:

λ_obs_max = (b / T_rest) * (1 + v/c)

So rearranged:

T_rest = b / λ_obs_max / (1 + v/c) = [b / λ_obs_max] * [1/(1 + v/c)] = T_obs * [1/(1 + v/c)].

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, let's take the Doppler shift into account.

For Star_2, the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive because it's moving away. So λ_rest = λ_obs / (1 + v/c).

Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T_rest.

So λ_obs = (b / T_rest) * (1 + v/c).

Rearranged, we get T_rest = (b (1 + v/c)) / λ_obs = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v/c) = T_obs * (1 + v/c).

So T_rest is higher than T_obs for Star_2.

Wait, but earlier I thought T_obs is the same for both stars. Because the problem says the peak wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So both λ_obs are the same.

So for Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_obs.

For Star_2: λ_obs = λ_rest2 * (1 + v/c).

So λ_rest2 = λ_obs / (1 + v/c) = λ_obs * (1/(1 + v/c)).

But since λ_rest is inversely proportional to T_rest, so T_rest2 = T_obs * (1 + v/c).

So in terms of their actual temperatures:

T1 = T_obs (since Star_1 isn't moving), and T2_rest = T_obs * (1 + v/c).

So now, the luminosities are:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴
L2 = 4π R2² σ T2_rest⁴

So L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2_rest⁴)

We know R1 = 1.5 R2 → (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 = T_obs.

T2_rest = T_obs * (1 + v/c) → T2_rest⁴ = [T_obs (1 + v/c)]^4.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * [T_obs^4 / (T_obs^4 (1 + v/c)^4) ) ] = 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4.

Wait, that's interesting. Because in the earlier approach without considering velocities, I thought the factor was 2.25, but when considering the velocity, since T2 is higher, this might change the result.

Wait, but wait, in the initial approach, I thought that T1 and T2 were the same because their peak wavelengths are same. But that was under the assumption that the stars' own rest wavelengths were same, which isn't the case because Star_2 is moving away.

So this complicates things. So now, the problem is: when calculating luminosity, which T do we use? Because the stars' actual temperatures are higher for Star_2, but the observed T is lower.

But the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. So perhaps they use the observed T for each star. Or wait, no. Let me think. If the star is moving, the observed wavelength is longer, so the observed T is lower, but the actual T is higher.

Wait, but when using the black body formula, the luminosity depends on the star's actual properties, not the observed. So when calculating L, the astronomers would use the actual T, not the observed T. Because L is an intrinsic property.

But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So they have the same λ_obs. So using this, the astronomers would infer the same T_obs for both stars, but in reality, Star_2 has higher T_rest due to its motion.

Wait, but if the astronomers don't account for the Doppler shift, then they would think that both stars have the same T. But if they do account for it, then they would correct for the velocity and know that Star_2's T is higher.

But the question says that they computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. So perhaps they used the observed T for each star. But that would be incorrect because the observed T is lower than the actual T for Star_2.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the observed T is the same for both stars, but the actual T of Star_2 is higher. So when computing luminosity, which is based on actual T, we have to adjust for that.

Hmm. So let me redo the approach.

The key is to find L1 and L2, the intrinsic luminosities.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4
L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

But T1 and T2 are the actual (rest) temperatures.

We know that the observed λ_max is the same for both, which is λ_obs.

But for Star_1, since it's not moving, λ_obs = λ_rest1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, which is moving away, λ_obs = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is 700 km/s.

But λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So:

λ_obs = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

And for Star_1:

λ_obs = b / T1.

So, setting them equal:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Canceling b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) (1 + v2/c )

→ T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Because (1 + v/c) is 1.002333... as before.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

Now, the luminosities:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4
L2 = 4π R2² σ (T1 * 1.002333 )^4

Divide L1 by L2:

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * [ T1^4 / ( T1^4 * (1.002333)^4 ) ) ]
= (2.25) * [1 / (1.002333)^4 ]

Calculate (1.002333)^4.

Let me approximate that. Since 1.002333 is about 1.00233.

(1.00233)^4 ≈ ?

We can use the binomial approximation for small x:

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2)x² + ... 

x is 0.002333.

n=4.

So (1 + 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)*(0.002333)^2 + (4*3*2/6)*(0.002333)^3 + ... 

Compute each term:

First term: 1.

Second term: 4 * 0.002333 = 0.009332.

Third term: 6 * (0.002333)^2 ≈ 6 * (0.00000544) ≈ 0.00003264.

Fourth term: 4 * (0.002333)^3 ≈ 4 * (0.0000000125) ≈ 0.00000005.

So adding up:

1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332.

Plus 0.00003264 → 1.00936464.

Plus 0.00000005 → ≈1.00936469.

So approximately 1.009365.

So 1/(1.009365) ≈ 0.99075.

Wait, but wait: (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009365? Let me double-check with exact calculation.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

Let me compute 1.002333^4 step by step.

1.002333^2 = (approx) 1.004667.

Then square that: (1.004667)^2 = 1.009344.

So 1.009344.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009344.

So 1/(1.009344) ≈ 0.99075.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ approximately 2.228.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.99075: 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275. So approximately 2.228.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~2.23, which matches this.

But wait, is this correct? Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, in the problem statement, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, which is v = 700 km/s.

So for Star_2, v = 700 km/s, so v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333..., as before.

Thus, (1 + v/c) = 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So L2 = 4π R2² σ (T1 * 1.002333 )^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / (T1^4 * (1.002333)^4)) )

= ( (1.5)^2 ) * (1/(1.002333)^4 )

Which is 2.25 * (1/(1.002333)^4 )

Wait, earlier I thought (1.002333)^4 is about 1.009344, but wait, that's (1.002333)^4 = approx 1.009344.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009344 ≈ ?

Wait, 2.25 divided by 1.009344.

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009344.

Let me approximate:

1.009344 is approximately 1.00934.

So 2.25 / 1.00934 ≈ ?

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 1.00934 * 2.228 = ?

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute 2.25 / 1.00934.

Let me compute 1.00934 ≈ 1 + 0.00934.

So 2.25 / (1 + 0.00934) = 2.25 * (1 - 0.00934 + (0.00934)^2 - ... ) approximately, using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So 2.25 * (1 - 0.00934 ) = 2.25 * 0.99066 = approx 2.25 *0.99066.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99066:

2 * 0.99066 = 1.98132.

0.25 *0.99066 = 0.247665.

Total: 1.98132 + 0.247665 = 2.228985.

So approximately 2.229.

Which is about 2.23.

Looking back at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because earlier I thought the velocities wouldn't matter because the observed T would be same, but that was incorrect. Because the actual T of Star_2 is higher, which affects its luminosity.

So I think the correct approach is considering the velocities and adjusting for T, leading to a lower L1/L2 ratio than 2.25. So the correct answer is D, ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the effective temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies and have the same observed peak wavelength (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)). Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\), where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant, the observed temperature (\(T_{\text{obs}}\)) is the same for both stars. However, the actual (rest) temperature of Star_2 (\(T_2\)) is affected by its radial velocity (\(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)) due to the Doppler effect.

### Key Steps:
1. **Doppler Shift and Temperature Adjustment**:
   - For Star_2, the observed wavelength is related to its rest wavelength by:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
     \]
     where \(v/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333\). Thus, the rest temperature of Star_2 is:
     \[
     T_2 = T_{\text{obs}} \cdot (1 + v/c) \approx T_{\text{obs}} \cdot 1.002333
     \]

2. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity ratio is given by:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
     Since \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_1 = T_{\text{obs}}\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}
     \]
     Substituting \(R_1 / R_2 = 1.5\) and \(T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333\), this becomes:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{(1.002333)^4}
     \]

3. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - \((1.5)^2 = 2.25\).
   - Approximating \((1.002333)^4\) using the binomial expansion:
     \[
     (1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4 \cdot 0.002333 + \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2} \cdot (0.002333)^2 \approx 1.009344
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.009344} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.99075 \approx 2.228
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is approximately \(2.23\).

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
