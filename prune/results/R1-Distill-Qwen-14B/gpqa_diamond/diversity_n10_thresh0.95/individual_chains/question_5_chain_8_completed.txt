Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, with eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P is given in its components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator (or any vector operator) can be represented in terms of its components. So if the direction is arbitrary, the operator P can be written as P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z, right? But wait, here the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, so n_y must be zero. Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), but since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

Wait, no, wait. The direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1. So the operator along n would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero, so the Py term drops out.

Wait, but the problem says the operator is along direction n. So I need to find the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, P is a vector operator, right? So P_n is the component along n. The eigenvalues for the spin-1/2 system (like a muon, which is a lepton with spin 1/2) should be ±ħ/2. Since the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the + state.

So the first step is to express P_n in terms of the given components.

Given that P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

So P_n = n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z. Let's compute that matrix.

Let me compute each term. The matrix for P_x is [[0 1],[1 0]], so when multiplied by (ħ/2), it's (ħ/2) times that. Similarly for P_z, it's (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So P_n's matrix would be (n_x * (ħ/2) ) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z * (ħ/2)) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let me compute this as a matrix. 

The first term (from P_x) is [[0, n_x ħ/2], [n_x ħ/2, 0]].
The second term (from P_z) is [[n_z ħ/2, 0], [0, -n_z ħ/2]].
Adding these together:

P_n = [[n_z ħ/2, n_x ħ/2],
        [n_x ħ/2, -n_z ħ/2]]

So the matrix for P_n is [[ (n_z ħ/2), (n_x ħ/2) ],
                        [ (n_x ħ/2), (-n_z ħ/2) ] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So substituting the matrix, we have:

[ [ (n_z ħ/2), (n_x ħ/2) ],
  [ (n_x ħ/2), (-n_z ħ/2) ] ] 
 * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Where [a; b] is the eigenvector.

So, writing the equations:

(n_z ħ/2) a + (n_x ħ/2) b = (ħ/2) a
(n_x ħ/2) a + (-n_z ħ/2) b = (ħ/2) b

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let's rearrange each equation:

1. (n_z a) + (n_x b) = a => (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
2. n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

So from equation 2: n_x a = (n_z +1) b

Let me express a in terms of b.

a = [(n_z +1)/n_x ] * b

But wait, n_x and n_z are components of a unit vector in the x-z plane, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

Let me substitute a into equation 1.

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

Substitute a = (n_z +1)/n_x * b:

(n_z -1) * (n_z +1)/n_x * b + n_x b = 0

Multiply through by n_x to eliminate the denominator:

(n_z -1)(n_z +1) b + n_x^2 b = 0

Expand (n_z^2 -1) b + n_x^2 b = 0

Wait, because (n_z -1)(n_z +1) = n_z^2 -1.

So (n_z^2 -1 + n_x^2) b = 0

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 (since n is a unit vector), so substituting:

(1 -1) b = 0 → 0*b = 0 → 0=0.

Hmm, that's an identity, which means the equations are dependent, and we have a single equation to work with.

So from equation 2, a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.

But since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple, I can choose b as a parameter.

Let me set b = 1 for simplicity, then a = (n_z +1)/n_x.

But wait, we need to normalize the eigenvector. So the vector [a; b] should have a magnitude of 1.

But perhaps it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of angles.

Wait, the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane. So it can be written in terms of an angle θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, because in the x-z plane, θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, no. Let me think. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then the spherical coordinates would have θ as the polar angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be zero (or 180, but that's covered). Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane would correspond to φ=0 or φ=π, but more generally, any φ where the y-component is zero. So for a direction in the x-z plane, the direction cosines are (l, 0, m), where l^2 + m^2 =1.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to parametrize n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting, a = (n_z +1)/n_x * b = (cosθ +1)/sinθ * b.

Let me express this as ( (1 + cosθ)/sinθ ) * b.

But 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

(1 + cosθ)/sinθ = [2 cos²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [cos(θ/2)] / [sin(θ/2)] ] = cot(θ/2).

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Let me write the eigenvector as [a; b] = [cot(θ/2) * b; b ].

We can factor out b, so [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T multiplied by b.

But to normalize, the magnitude squared must be 1.

The components are a = cot(θ/2) * b and b = b.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = b² [ cot²(θ/2) + 1 ] = b² [ csc²(θ/2) ] = (b²) (1 / sin²(θ/2)).

We set this equal to 1, so b² = sin²(θ/2). Therefore, b = ± sin(θ/2).

Choosing b = sin(θ/2), then a = cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait. The components are a = cos(θ/2) and b = sin(θ/2). But wait, is it [a; b] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T?

Wait, that would make the vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]. But wait, the eigenvector is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmmm, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates are often represented as spin-up or spin-down along a certain axis. The eigenvectors are usually written with a factor of 1/sqrt(2) when θ=90 degrees, but perhaps that's in specific basis.

Wait, perhaps I should check the math again.

Wait, when θ=0, the direction is along z. So n_x=0, n_z=1. Then the eigenvalue equation for +ħ/2 would correspond to the state |+z>, which is [0; 1], but according to our earlier expression, [cos(0/2), sin(0/2)] = [1,0], which is the |+z> state. That's correct.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. When θ is 0, n is along +z. Then the eigenstate for P_z = +ħ/2 is [0,1]^T, as P_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>.

But according to our earlier result, the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. When θ=0, that becomes [1, 0], which is the |+z> state. But that's not correct because P_z |+z> = (ħ/2) *1 * [0, 1]?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, P_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 is [1, 0]^T, because P_z [1; 0] = (ħ/2)(1) [1; 0]. So that's correct. So when θ=0, our solution [1,0] is correct for +ħ/2.

Similarly, when θ=180 degrees (n along -z), cos(theta/2) becomes cos(90) = 0, sin(theta/2) = sin(90)=1. So the eigenvector would be [0,1], which is the eigenstate for -ħ/2. But wait, we're looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, so that's not correct.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, maybe I messed up the parametrization of n. Let me think again. If n is along the positive z-direction, then n_x=0, n_z=1. So the eigenstate should be [0,1], but according to our earlier result, [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] = [cos(0), sin(0)] = [1,0], which is the |+z> state. But P_n when n is +z is just P_z. So P_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, which is correct.

Wait, but when n is along +z, the operator P_n is P_z. So the eigenstate for +ħ/2 is [1,0], which is correct.

Wait, but when n is along -z, n_z = -1. Then [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] becomes cos( (180)/2 )= cos(90)=0, sin(theta/2)=1. So the vector is [0,1], which is the eigenstate for P_z with eigenvalue -ħ/2. But in our problem, we're looking for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue. So that suggests that perhaps the parametrization is correct when theta is measured from the +z direction.

So yes, when theta=0, the vector is [1,0], which is correct for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

When theta is 180 degrees, n is pointing along -z. So the eigenvalue for +ħ/2 would not be [0,1], but perhaps [0,-i] or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The operator P_n when n is along -z would be P_z multiplied by -1. So P_n = - P_z. So the eigenvalue for the eigenstate [0,1] would be (-1) * (ħ/2) * (1) * (0,1) → the eigenvalue would be -ħ/2.

Wait, perhaps for the direction n pointing along -z, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 would correspond to the state [0,1], but that seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the parametrization is correct, and the direction theta is measured from +z, so for theta=180, the state would be [0,1], which would correspond to eigenvalue +ħ/2 in this case.

Wait, no, because when n is along -z, P_n = - P_z. So the eigenvalue for [0,1] would be - (ħ/2) *1 * [0,1] → eigenvalue would be -ħ/2. So I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should proceed without worrying about that for now.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. But wait, the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the options have other possibilities. Let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I need to consider the normalization again.

Wait, when I found the components as a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2), their squares add up to cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) =1, so the vector is already normalized.

But looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) which matches what I have.

But wait, let me see what the other options are.

Option B is (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta ). That looks like spherical coordinates but not necessarily the same as our result.

Option A is (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar ), which looks like specific values, perhaps for a particular theta.

Option D is scaled versions involving sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively.

Wait, but our solution suggests that the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct option would be option C.

But wait, let me think again. Did I miss a factor of ħ or anything? The problem statement says that each component of P (like P_x) is (ħ/2) times a matrix. So when we construct P_n, the matrices are scaled by (ħ/2). But the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector, so the elements are just the components without any ħ factors, right?

Looking back, the options have some options with hbar in them, but option C doesn't. So perhaps I'm correct that the answer is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the operator. The eigenvector should be a unit vector regardless of the matrix elements, which are scaled by ħ/2. So the eigenvector's elements are indeed cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so option C is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each represented as $\hbar/2$ times a 2x2 matrix. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero, and the operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P}_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]

where $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the direction cosines of $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, satisfying $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P}_n$ is:

\[
\vec{P}_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P}_n |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle
\]

where $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $\vec{P}_n$ into the eigenvalue equation and simplifying, we find the eigenvector components satisfy:

\[
a = \cos(\theta/2), \quad b = \sin(\theta/2)
\]

Here, $\theta$ is the polar angle of $\vec{n}$ measured from the positive z-axis, with $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. The eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This represents specific values for the eigenvector components, but it does not match the general form derived above.

- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
  This resembles spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector components.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived normalized eigenvector components exactly.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This introduces additional scaling factors that are not present in the derived eigenvector.

Thus, the correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
