Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance to a star. Oh right, the formula is distance d (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax plx (in arcseconds). So d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. I think this has to do with how the density of stars changes with distance. Wait, if stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is the same throughout space. So, the number of stars in a certain volume should depend on the volume of that region.

Let me imagine a spherical shell at a distance d with a thickness delta_d. The volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere (4πd²) multiplied by delta_d. So volume V = 4πd² delta_d.

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, for a uniform distribution, N ∝ V. So N = k * V, where k is the constant of proportionality.

But the question is about the number per unit parallax. So I need to express this in terms of parallax plx instead of distance d. Since d = 1/plx, I can substitute that into the equation.

Let's see, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me write that as d = (1/plx), so delta_d would be the change in d when plx changes by delta_plx. Wait, perhaps I should express delta_d in terms of delta_plx.

Differentiating d = 1/plx, the derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So delta_d ≈ - (1/plx²) delta_plx. The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense. But the magnitude is what's important here.

Wait, but I'm interested in the number of stars per unit plx. So maybe I should find the number density as a function of plx. Let me think again.

The number of stars in a shell with thickness delta_plx (in parallax) would be proportional to the volume of that shell in terms of parallax. Or perhaps it's the derivative of the number with respect to plx.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Since N is the number of stars in a volume V, and V is 4πd² delta_d, and delta_d is related to delta_plx via d = 1/plx, so delta_d = - (1/plx²) delta_plx.

But I need to express N per unit plx. So, the number per unit plx would be dN/dplx. Because when plx increases by a small amount, the number of stars in that range is how much?

So, dN/dplx = (dN/dD) * (dD/dplx), using the chain rule. Because N is a function of D, and D is a function of plx.

Wait, N is proportional to V, which is 4π D² delta_D. So, the number of stars per unit volume (in terms of D) is k, so dN/dD = 4π D² * k.

Then, dN/dplx = (dN/dD) * (dD/dplx). 

We know D = 1/plx, so dD/dplx = -1/(plx²). Therefore, dN/dplx = (4π (1/plx)^2 k) * (-1/(plx²)) ) ?

Wait, no. Let me correct that. dN/dD is 4π D² k, right? Because for each D, the shell's volume is 4πD² delta_D, and the number is proportional to that. So,

dN/dD = 4π D² k.

Now, since D = 1/plx, then dD/dplx = -1/(plx²). So,

dN/dplx = dN/dD * dD/dplx
= (4π (1/plx)^2 k) * (-1/(plx^2))
= -4π k (1/plx^4 )

But wait, the number can't be negative. Oh right, because as plx increases, D decreases, so the negative sign indicates that the number decreases as plx increases. But when we talk about the number per unit plx, we're probably interested in the magnitude.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Wait, but that would be option A.

Wait, let me double-check. Because I'm integrating over a small range of plx, so the change in D is delta_D = - (1/plx²) delta_plx. So the number of stars in this range is dN = 4π D² delta_D * k.

Substituting D=1/plx, delta_D = - (1/(plx^2)) delta_plx. So,

dN = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/(plx^2)) delta_plx * k
= 4π k ( -1 / plx^4 ) delta_plx.

So, the number per unit plx is dN/(delta_plx) ) = (4π k)(-1/plx^4 ). So the magnitude is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought the number would drop off as 1/plx squared, but maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of stars in a given parallax range. Let's consider the volume between plx and plx + dplx. The distance for plx is D = 1/plx. For plx+dplx, it's D+delta_D = 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ 1/plx - (dplx)/(plx^2) because (1/(a + da)) ≈ (1/a)(1 - (da/a)).

So, the volume between D and D + delta_D is V = 4π ( (D + delta_D)^2 - D^2 ) * something? Wait, no. The volume of a thin shell is 4π D² delta_D. So, the volume between D and D + delta_D is 4π D² delta_D. But since delta_D is negative (because increasing plx means D decreases), the shell's volume is 4π (D^2)(-dD), where dD is the change in D.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of plx. Let me consider a small change in plx from plx to plx + dplx. The corresponding change in distance is dD = d(1/plx) = -1/plx^2 dplx.

So the volume of the shell in that dplx range is the surface area at distance D multiplied by the thickness dD. So,

V = 4π D² |dD|.

Because dD is negative, so we take the absolute value.

V = 4π (1/plx)^2 (1/plx^2 ) dplx.

Wait, no. Let's compute that correctly.

dD = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, |dD| = (1/plx^2) dplx.

So,

V = 4π (D)^2 |dD| = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx.

So,

V = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, the number of stars in this shell is N = k * V = k * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars per unit plx is N per dplx, which is (k * 4π (1/plx^4 )) dplx. So, the number per unit plx is (k * 4π (1/plx^4 )).

Which implies that the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, that's option A, but I thought the answer is 1/plx^2. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me think about it another way. The number of stars in a given volume is uniform. The volume around a star at distance D is a sphere of radius D. The number of stars in a spherical shell between D and D + delta_D is 4π D² delta_D * n, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

So, dN = 4π D² n delta_D.

But, since D = 1/plx, delta_D = - (1/plx^2) delta_plx.

Substituting,

dN = 4π (1/plx)^2 n (-1/plx^2) delta_plx.

So,

dN = -4π n (1/plx^4 ) delta_plx.

But the number of stars in the range plx to plx + dplx is positive, so the negative sign indicates that as plx increases (distance decreases), the number of stars in that shell decreases.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is:

dN/dplx = -4π n / (plx^4 )

So, the magnitude is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hence, the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, that would mean the answer is option A: ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I thought that the number density in 3D space is uniform, so the number of stars in a given volume should depend on the volume, which for a shell is proportional to D^2 delta_D.

Hmm, but when you express delta_D in terms of delta_plx, it's 1/plx^2 times delta_plx, so:

dN/dplx = (dN/dD) * (dD/dplx) = (4π D^2 n) * (-1/plx^2 ).

Since D = 1/plx,

(4π (1/plx)^2 n) * (-1/plx^2 ) = -4π n / plx^4.

So, the number is inversely proportional to plx^4. So, option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard before that the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dD) is proportional to 1/D^2, which is the same as plx^2. But that's when considering distance instead of parallax.

Wait, let's get back. The number of stars per unit distance (dN/dD) is proportional to 4π D^2 n, because the volume per unit D is 4π D² delta_D. So dN/dD = 4π D^2 n.

So, dN/dD = 4π n D². So, when D increases, this goes as D squared. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with D squared.

But since D = 1/plx, dN/dD = 4π n (1/plx)^2.

So, dN/dD is proportional to 1/plx^2.

But the question is about dN/dplx, the number of stars per unit change in plx.

So, as D = 1/plx, plx = 1/D.

So, dN/dplx = dN/dD * dD/dplx.

We know dN/dD = 4π n D^2.

dD/dplx = -1/(plx^2) = - D².

So,

dN/dplx = (4π n D²) * (-D² ) = -4π n D^4.

But D = 1/plx, so D^4 = (1/plx)^4.

Thus,

dN/dplx = -4π n (1/plx)^4.

So, the magnitude is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax range is inversely proportional to plx^4.

So the correct answer is option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that the distance \( D \) to a star is related to its parallax by \( D = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a spherical shell of thickness \( \Delta D \) at distance \( D \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi D^2 \Delta D \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance (\( dN/dD \)) is proportional to \( D^2 \).

Next, we express the number of stars per unit parallax (\( dN/d\text{plx} \)) by relating \( D \) and \( \text{plx} \). Since \( D = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the change in \( D \) with respect to \( \text{plx} \) is \( \frac{dD}{d\text{plx}} = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \). Using the chain rule, \( \frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{dN}{dD} \cdot \frac{dD}{d\text{plx}} \). Substituting \( \frac{dN}{dD} \propto D^2 \) and \( \frac{dD}{d\text{plx}} = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto D^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} = \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
