Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The given metric is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's written in terms of dx² and dy². So we're working in two dimensions here. But wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. So maybe this metric represents a pseudosphere.

In two dimensions, the metric can be written in different forms depending on the coordinate system. The general form for a surface of revolution with constant curvature would be something like ds² = A² dr² + B² dθ², but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, maybe it's in isothermal coordinates or something else.

Let me think about the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So 4 is like r² where r is 2, since 2 squared is 4. So the condition for the denominator not being zero is x² + y² < 4, which means we're in a region where the radius is less than 2. Wait, but the metric is given as (dx² + dy²) multiplied by 32 over (4 - x² - y²). So the line element depends on the position (x, y).

I remember that in a space with constant curvature, the metric can be written in terms of a conformal factor. The conformal factor here is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)), but I'm not sure about that. Wait, in conformally flat coordinates, the metric is often written as ds² = e^{2λ} (dx² + dy²). So here, λ would be (1/2) ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)), I think.

Wait, but what's the connection to the pseudosphere's area? Oh, a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere in two dimensions would be... Hmm, wait, pseudosphere is a term sometimes used for a tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in two dimensions, I guess the metric is for a space that's hyperbolic. So maybe the area is infinite, but that doesn't make sense because the options include a finite 4pi(x² + y²), but wait, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, actually, the given metric is defined for x² + y² <4. So it's a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane, but the metric isn't Euclidean. So perhaps the area of the surface (the pseudosphere) is computed using this metric.

In two dimensions, the area is the integral of sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Let me compute that. The metric is diagonal, with (dx² + dy²) multiplied by 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant of the metric tensor is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (1) * (1) - 0 = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, sqrt of (32/(4 - r²)) where r² = x² + y². So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ.

Wait, but let me compute the area. Let me switch to polar coordinates, since x² + y² = r². So dA = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ. The sqrt(32) is 4√2, so sqrt(32) = 4√2. So dA = (4√2 / sqrt(4 - r²)) ) * r dr dθ.

So the area would be the integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of (4√2 r) / sqrt(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Let me compute the radial integral first. Let u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r. So (-du/2) = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. The integral becomes:

Integral from u=4 to u=0 of (4√2) * (r dr) / sqrt(u) ) = 4√2 * ( -1/2 ) ∫ from 4 to 0 of du / sqrt(u) ) * (r dr is replaced by -du/2).

Wait, let me plug in:

∫ (4√2 r dr) / sqrt(4 - r²) ) = 4√2 ∫ [r dr] / sqrt(4 - r²)
= 4√2 ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / sqrt(u)
Because u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So substituting, the integral becomes 4√2 * (-1/2) ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (1/sqrt(u)) du.

But integrating from 4 to 0 would be the same as the negative of integrating from 0 to 4. Let me adjust the limits:

= 4√2 * (-1/2) * [ ∫ from u=4 to 0 (u^{-1/2} ) du ]
= 4√2 * (-1/2) * [ 2 sqrt(u) ) evaluated from 4 to 0 ]
= 4√2 * (-1/2) * (2 (0 - sqrt(4)) )
= 4√2 * (-1/2) * (2 (-2)) )
Wait, let's compute step by step.

First, the integral ∫ u^{-1/2} du from a to b is [2 sqrt(u)] from a to b.

So when I switch the limits from 4 to 0, it's ∫ from 4 to 0 = - ∫ from 0 to4.

So let me compute the integral as:

4√2 * (-1/2) * [2√u evaluated from 4 to 0] = 4√2 * (-1/2) * [2√0 - 2√4 ]

Wait, wait, no. The integral ∫ u^{-1/2} du from 4 to 0 is equal to [2 sqrt(u)] from 4 to 0 = 2*0 - 2*2 = -4.

So the integral becomes:

4√2 * (-1/2) * (-4) ) = 4√2 * (1/2) *4 )

Let me compute:

4√2 * ( ( (-1/2) * (-4) ) ) = 4√2 * (2) ) = 8√2.

So the radial integral is 8√2. Then we multiply by the integral over theta, which is 2π. So total area is 8√2 * 2π = 16√2 π.

Wait, but wait a minute. The options don't have this. The options are A)0, B)4π(x² + y²), C)4π(x² - y²), D)infinite.

Hmm, so none of the options match 16√2 π. That's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the question is not about computing the area using the metric, but about recognizing that the pseudosphere has infinite area? Wait, no, pseudospheres, like the tractricoid, are finite in area but have infinite perimeter. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, actually, a pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent but finite area. Because it's like a horn: it goes on infinitely, but its surface area is finite.

Wait, but in this case, the metric is defined on a finite domain, x² + y² <4. So the area would be finite. But the options don't have that; the only finite option is B and C, but they have x² and y² terms. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait the question is what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the radius being 2 affects the area. Wait, but the given metric is:

ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

Wait, 32 is 8*4, but 4 is 2 squared. So perhaps the factor is 32/(4 - r²), where r is x² + y².

Wait, another approach: the metric is conformally flat, so in two dimensions, the curvature is determined by the function λ in the conformal factor. The Ricci scalar curvature for a two-dimensional metric ds² = e^{2λ} (dx² + dy²) is given by R = -2 λ_{, ij} e^{-2λ}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a metric conformal to flat space, the Gaussian curvature is given by K = - (1/2) e^{-2λ} ( e^{2λ} )_{,ij} }, where the indices are contracted.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric. Because if the pseudosphere has constant negative curvature, then the Gaussian curvature K would be negative and constant.

So, to find the Gaussian curvature K of the metric, we can use the formula for a metric in isothermal coordinates:

K = - (1/2) e^{-2λ} ( e^{2λ} )_{,rr} - (1/(2r)) e^{-2λ} ( e^{2λ} )_{,r} ) 

Wait, perhaps another formula. Alternatively, the formula for the Gaussian curvature in terms of the conformal factor λ is:

K = -e^{-2λ} ( λ_{,rr} + λ_{,θθ} )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the Gaussian curvature using the standard formula for a metric in polar coordinates. Wait, the metric given is in Cartesian coordinates, but perhaps I can convert it to polar. Let me define r^2 = x^2 + y^2.

So the given metric becomes ds^2 = [32/(4 - r^2)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So in polar coordinates, it's ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

Now, the general form in polar coordinates is ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ². The Gaussian curvature K for such a metric is given by:

K = [ (B’/B ) - (A’/A) ) / 2 ]

Wait, wait, perhaps I should refer to the formula for the Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates.

The formula I recall is:

K = [ ( ( (sqrt(A) ) ' ) / sqrt(A) ) ) - (1/(2 r)) (sqrt(B/r²) ) ' ) ] / ( sqrt(A*B) ) )

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I think the Gaussian curvature for a metric ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) dθ² in polar coordinates is:

K = [ (B’ - A’ r ) / (2 r A B ) ) ] * (something... )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recall that for a metric in polar coordinates, the Gaussian curvature is:

K = [ ( (B - A ) / (2 r^2) ) ] 

Wait, no, perhaps not. Maybe I should use the formula that the Gaussian curvature K is given by the expression:

K = (1/(2 sqrt(AB))) [ ( (sqrt(A))' )' + ( (sqrt(B)) / r )' ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a metric of the form ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = - (f’’ + (f’)/r )

Wait, let me check this. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

K = - [ (f’’ ) / f + (f’ )/( r f ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I can find the formula for the Gaussian curvature in terms of f(r). If the metric is ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ² ), then the Gaussian curvature is:

K = - (1/f^2) [ f'' + (f')/r ]

Yes, I think that's correct. So in this case, let me express the given metric in terms of f(r). The given metric in polar coordinates is:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

So that's f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where f(r)^2 = 32/(4 - r²). So f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

So f(r) = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - r²) = 4 * sqrt(2) / sqrt(4 - r²).

Then f'(r) = d/dr [4√2 (4 - r²)^(-1/2) ) ] = 4√2 * ( (-1/2) (4 - r²)^(-3/2) ) * (-2r) )

Wait, let me compute that.

f(r) = 4√2 (4 - r²)^(-1/2).

f’(r) = 4√2 * (-1/2) * (-2r) (4 - r²)^(-3/2) )

Wait, because derivative of (4 - r²)^(-1/2) is (-1/2) (4 - r²)^(-3/2) * (-2r) ) = (r) (4 - r²)^(-3/2).

So f’(r) = 4√2 * (r) (4 - r²)^(-3/2) )

Similarly, f''(r) would be the derivative of that. Let me compute:

f’(r) = 4√2 r (4 - r²)^(-3/2)

f''(r) = 4√2 [ (4 - r²)^(-3/2) + r * (-3/2)(4 - r²)^(-5/2) (-2r) ) ]

Simplify:

= 4√2 [ (4 - r²)^(-3/2) + r * (3 r) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ) ]

= 4√2 [ ( (4 - r²) + 3 r² ) / (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ]

Because (4 - r²)^(-3/2) = (4 - r²)^( -5/2 +1 ) = (4 - r²)^( -5/2 ) * (4 - r²)^1.

So,

= 4√2 [ (4 - r² + 3 r² ) / (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ]

= 4√2 [ (4 + 2 r² ) / (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ]

Wait, 4 - r² +3 r² =4 + 2 r².

Now, plugging into the formula for K:

K = - (1/f(r)^2) [ f''(r) + (f'(r))/r ]

Wait, wait, the formula is:

K = - [ (f'' + (f')/r ) ] / f^2

Wait no, earlier I thought K = -(f'' + (f’/r )) / f².

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula. Let me think again: for the metric ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/f^2) [ f'' + (f' )/r ]

Yes, that's the formula I derived earlier.

So,

K = - (1/f² ) [ f'' + (f')/r ]

Compute each term:

f'' is [4√2 (4 + 2 r²) ] / (4 - r²)^(5/2) )

f' is 4√2 r / (4 - r²)^(3/2 )

So,

f'' + (f')/r = [4√2 (4 + 2 r²) / (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ] + [ (4√2 r) / (4 - r²)^(3/2 ) ) * (1/r) ]

Simplify the second term: (4√2 r)/(r (4 -r²)^(3/2 )) ) = 4√2 / (4 - r²)^(3/2 )

So,

= [4√2 (4 + 2 r²) ) / (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ] + [4√2 / (4 - r²)^(3/2) ) ]

Factor out 4√2/(4 - r²)^(5/2):

= [4√2 / (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ] [ (4 + 2 r²) + (4 - r²) * 1 ]

Because (4 - r²)^(3/2 ) is (4 - r²)^(5/2 - 1 ), so the second term is multiplied by (4 - r²) to get the same denominator.

Wait, let me compute:

The first term is (4 + 2 r²) multiplied by 4√2 / (4 - r²)^(5/2 )

The second term is 4√2 * (4 - r²)^(3/2 ) )^{-1} → but to combine, let's write it as 4√2 (4 - r²)^{-3/2} = 4√2 (4 - r²)^{-3/2} * (4 - r²)^{ (5/2 -3/2) } / (4 - r²)^{ (5/2 -3/2) } )

Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let's factor:

The expression is:

[4√2 (4 + 2 r²) ) + 4√2 (4 - r²) ] / (4 - r²)^(5/2 )

Because the second term is 4√2 (4 - r²)^{-3/2} = 4√2 (4 - r²)^{-3/2} * (4 - r²)^(2/2) ) / (4 - r²)^(2/2) )

Wait, no, perhaps I can factor the numerator:

4√2 (4 + 2 r² + (4 - r²) ) / (4 - r²)^{5/2}

Wait, because when you have the same denominator, you can add the numerators:

(4+2r²) from the first term and (4 - r²) from the second term because (4 - r²) multiplied by the second term's denominator.

Wait no, perhaps it's better to compute the numerator as:

4√2 (4 + 2 r²) + 4√2 (4 - r²) ) = 4√2 [ (4 + 2 r²) + (4 - r²) ) ] = 4√2 (8 + r² )

Wait, 4 + 2 r² +4 - r² = 8 + r².

So the numerator becomes 4√2 (8 + r² ), and the denominator is (4 - r²)^(5/2 )

So,

f'' + (f’)/r = [4√2 (8 + r² ) ] / (4 - r²)^(5/2 )

So K is:

K = - [ (4√2 (8 + r² )) / (4 - r²)^(5/2 ) ] / [ f^2 ]

But f^2 is (32)/(4 - r²). So,

K = - [ (4√2 (8 + r² )) / (4 - r²)^(5/2 ) ] * (4 - r²)/32 )

Simplify:

= - [4√2 (8 + r²) (4 - r²) ) ] / [ (4 - r²)^(5/2) * 32 ) ]

= - [4√2 (8 + r²) ] / [ (4 - r²)^(3/2) * 32 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4√2 /32 = √2 /8.

So,

K = - [ √2 (8 + r²) ] / [ (4 - r²)^(3/2) * 8 ) ]

= - [ (8 + r²) √2 ] / [8 (4 - r²)^(3/2) ) ]

Hmm, but for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature K should be a negative constant. Wait, but this expression for K depends on r, which suggests it's not a constant. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and this isn't a pseudosphere.

Wait, but the question says, "what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" So perhaps the metric given is that of a pseudosphere with radius 2. But wait, in that case, K should be a constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a flat spacetime, but I don't think so. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Let me compute the Gaussian curvature.

Wait, another way to compute Gaussian curvature is to compute the Ricci scalar. For a two-dimensional metric, the Ricci scalar is equal to the Gaussian curvature. The formula is:

R = - (g^{rr} g^{θθ} )^{-1} [ (g_{rr,θ} )_{,θ} / r + ... ] 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates, which is:

K = - (1/(2 r^2)) [ (g_{rr} )_{,θ} - (g_{rθ} )_{,r} + (g_{θθ} )/(r^2) ) ]

Wait, maybe not. Let me think of a different approach.

Alternatively, let me compute the components of the metric.

In polar coordinates,

g_rr = 32/(4 - r^2)

g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r^2 )

g_rθ = g_θr = 0.

The Gaussian curvature in 2D is given by:

K = -(1/(2 sqrt(g))) [ ( (∂_r (sqrt(g) g^rr )) + (∂_θ (sqrt(g) g^rθ )) ) / sqrt(g) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

K = (1/(2 sqrt(g))) [ g^{ir} ∂_j (g_{ir}) ) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should find a resource or a formula.

Wait, another approach. For a metric in polar coordinates, the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = (1/(2 r^2)) [ (g_{rr} )_{,θ} - (g_{rθ} )_{,r} + (g_{θθ} )/(r^2) ) ]

But since g_{rθ}=0, this simplifies.

So,

K = (1/(2 r^2)) [ (g_{rr})_{,θ} + (g_{θθ}/ r^2) ) ]

But g_{rr} and g_{θθ} are functions of r only, not θ. So their derivatives with respect to θ are zero.

So,

K = (1/(2 r^2)) [ 0 + (g_{θθ}/ r^2) ) ]

g_{θθ} is 32 r²/(4 - r² ), so,

K = (1/(2 r^2)) [ (32 r²/(4 - r^2 )) / r^2 ) ]

Simplify:

= (1/(2 r^2 )) * (32/(4 - r^2 )) * r^2 )

The r^2 cancels out:

= (32) / (2 (4 - r^2 ) )

= 16/(4 - r^2 )

So K = 16/(4 - r^2 )

Wait, so the Gaussian curvature depends on r. So this is not a space of constant curvature. Hmm, but the question is about a pseudosphere which should have constant negative curvature. So perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute the area differently.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2, so perhaps the given metric is of a pseudosphere with radius 2. The area of a pseudosphere is known to be 4π r². Wait, no. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and its area is finite.

Wait, a sphere of radius a has area 4π a². But a pseudosphere (tractricoid) has finite area. The area of a pseudosphere is 4π r², same as a sphere? Or is it different?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The tractrix has a surface of revolution called the tractricoid, which is a pseudosphere. The area of this surface is finite. The formula I recall is that the area is 4π r², where r is the radius of curvature. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think for a pseudosphere, the area is 4π r², same as a sphere, but the circumference is infinite.

Wait, but in our case, the radius is given as r=2, so the area would be 4π (2)^2 = 16π. But the options don't have 16π. Hmm, but another thought: perhaps the given metric isn't of a pseudosphere. Because the Gaussian curvature here isn't constant.

Wait, so in the given metric, the Gaussian curvature K is 16/(4 - r^2 ), which depends on r. So it's not a pseudosphere, as pseudospheres have constant negative curvature.

But the question states that it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2, so perhaps this metric actually represents a pseudosphere. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation of K.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing K. Let me recheck.

Wait, the formula I used earlier for K in polar coordinates when g_{rθ}=0 is:

K = -(1/(2 r^2 )) [ (g_{rr})_{,θ} - (g_{rθ})_{,r} + (g_{θθ}/r^2) ) ]

Since g_{rθ}=0, and g_{rr} and g_{θθ} are functions of r only, their partial derivatives with respect to θ are zero.

So,

K = -(1/(2 r^2 )) [ 0 - 0 + (g_{θθ}/r^2) ) ]

= -(1/(2 r^2 )) * (g_{θθ}/ r^2 )

= - g_{θθ}/(2 r^4 )

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait, another source I recall: for a metric in polar coordinates, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = (1/(2 r^2)) [ (g_{rr})_{,θ} - (g_{rθ})_{,r} + (g_{θθ}) / r^2 ) ]

So when g_{rθ}=0, K becomes (1/(2 r^2)) [0 + (g_{θθ} ) / r^2 ) ].

So,

K = [g_{θθ} ] / ( 2 r^4 )

But wait, in our case, g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r² )

So,

K = [32 r²/(4 - r²) ] / (2 r^4 )

= [32 / (4 - r²) ] / (2 r^2 )

= 16/( (4 - r²) r^2 )

Wait, but this is still dependent on r. So perhaps this metric isn't of a pseudosphere but of a hyperbolic space with varying curvature.

But the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius 2, which has constant negative curvature. So perhaps the given metric is not of a pseudosphere, but perhaps the question is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the given metric is conformally flat, and the area is infinite because the denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2. Wait, but the domain is x² + y² <4, so r approaches 2 but doesn't reach it. So the area would be finite. But perhaps the area is 16√2 π, as I computed earlier, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is infinite because the metric has a singularity at r=2, but no, the domain is up to r=2, not beyond. So the area would be finite.

Wait, but another thought: the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). If I write this as ds² = (32/(4 - r^2)) (dr² + r^2 dθ^2 ), then as r approaches 2, the coefficient blows up. So perhaps the area is infinite because the integral diverges at r=2.

Wait, earlier I computed the area as 16√2 π, which is finite, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recompute the area integral.

The area element is sqrt( det g ) dr dθ, with g being the metric tensor. In this case, the metric is diagonal, so det g = (32/(4 - r^2)) * (32 r²/(4 - r^2 )) ) = (32^2 r² )/(4 - r^2)^2 )

So sqrt(det g ) = 32 r/(4 - r^2 )

So the area is integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32 r/(4 - r^2 ) ] dr dθ.

So first integrate over θ: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

Then the integral becomes 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r^2 ) ] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r^2 ) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: u =4 - r^2 → du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So,

∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r^2 ) ] = ∫ [32 * (-du/2) ) / u ]

= ∫ (-16) (1/u ) du from u=4 to u=0.

= -16 [ ln |u| ] from 4 to 0.

= -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral becomes:

-16 ( -infty - ln4 ) = +infty.

Wait a minute, so the integral diverges, which means the area is infinite. So the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D.

But earlier I thought the integral was finite. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, the area element is sqrt( det g ) dr dθ. So sqrt( (32/(4 - r^2)) * (32 r²/(4 - r^2 )) ) ) = sqrt( (1024 r² )/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ) = (32 r)/(4 - r^2 )

So the area is ∫0^{2π} ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r^2 ) ] dr dθ.

The integral over θ is 2π. So the total area is 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r^2 ) ] dr.

Let me compute ∫ [32 r/(4 - r^2 ) ] dr.

As before, u =4 - r^2 → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So,

∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r^2 ) ] = ∫ [32 * (-du/2 ) / u ] = ∫ [ -16 (1/u) du ]

The limits when r=0 → u=4, r=2 → u=0.

So,

= -16 ∫ from 4 to 0 of (1/u) du = -16 [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

= -16 [ ln 0 - ln 4 ].

But ln 0 is -infty, so this becomes:

= -16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = -16 * (-infty) = +infty.

So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. So the answer is option D: +infty.

Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Because the domain is up to r=2, but the integrand approaches infinity there. So perhaps the area is indeed infinite.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a region of radius \(r < 2\). The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) using this metric.

### Key Observations:
1. **Metric Structure**: The metric is conformally flat, with a conformal factor \(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\), where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\). In polar coordinates, the metric becomes:
   \[
   ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
   \]

2. **Area Element**: The area element in this metric is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. For a diagonal metric \(g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}\) and \(g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}\), the determinant is:
   \[
   \det g = g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
   \]
   The area element is then:
   \[
   dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

3. **Area Integral**: The total area is obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the domain \(r \in [0, 2]\) and \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)\):
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Divergence of the Integral**: To compute the radial integral \(\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr\), use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which gives \(r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2}\). The limits change as follows: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\); when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). The integral becomes:
   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln u\right]_4^0.
   \]
   As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln u \to -\infty\), leading to:
   \[
   -16 \left[\ln 0 - \ln 4\right] = -16 \left[-\infty - \ln 4\right] = +\infty.
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: The area integral diverges, meaning the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect. The area is not zero, as the metric covers a non-degenerate region.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect. This expression depends on \(x\) and \(y\), which is inconsistent with the total area being a scalar.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect. Similar to option B, this expression depends on \(x\) and \(y\), which is invalid for the total area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct. The area integral diverges due to the singularity at \(r = 2\), leading to an infinite area.

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere is infinite.
