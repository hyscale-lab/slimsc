Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The options are A to D with various coordinates.

The density matrix given is rho equals one half times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, but this looks like a mixed state because it's a convex combination of two projectors.

So, first, I need to figure out what this rho represents. Each term is a projector onto the basis states |0> and |1>, right? And each has a coefficient of 1/2. So the state is an equal mixture of |0> and |1>.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position. I think this refers to how the state is represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |psi>, the density matrix is |psi><psi|, and it corresponds to a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But when it's a mixed state, like here, the density matrix is a statistical mixture, so it's represented inside the Bloch sphere.

How do you find the Bloch vector for a mixed state? I recall that for a general 2x2 density matrix, you can express it in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's write rho as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2. Comparing this with the given rho, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, |0><0| is a projector, and |1><1| is another. Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of Pauli matrices.

Wait, |0> is (1, 0) and |1> is (0,1). So |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I.

So when I compute rho, it's (I + 0)/2, because (|0><0| + |1><1|) is I. So rho = I/2. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Because |0><0| + |1><1| is indeed I, so rho is (I)/2.

Wait, but the identity matrix divided by 2 is a density matrix with all diagonal elements 1/2 and off-diagonal zero. So rho is diagonal with 1/2 in both diagonal entries.

Now, going back to the general form: rho = (I + r·σ)/2. Comparing, our rho is (I)/2. So that implies that r·σ = 0. Because (I + 0)/2 is I/2.

But wait, r·σ is a vector multiplied by the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are [[0,1],[1,0]] for σx, [[0,-i],[i,0]] for σy, and [[1,0],[0,-1]] for σz. So if r·σ is zero, each component must be zero. So r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz = 0 matrix.

The only way this can happen is if r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. Because each Pauli matrix is non-zero, and adding them with zero coefficients gives zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). That means the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Wait, but that doesn't make sense for a mixed state.

Wait, no. The density matrix I/2 is the completely mixed state. It has zero Bloch vector, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because in the Bloch representation, the completely mixed state is the maximally uncertain state, which is the center.

So looking at the options, which one is (0,0,0)? Option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The options are given as r=(1,1,0), etc. Are those Bloch vectors? Because in the Bloch sphere, the vector must have a length less than or equal to 1. Because the state is a unit vector in 3D space. So for this case, r is (0,0,0), which is certainly within the sphere.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Bloch sphere but about coordinates in Hilbert space. But I think in qubit space, the Bloch sphere is the standard way to represent the state geometrically.

So the correct geometrical position is at the origin, which is option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state that is an equal mixture of the basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we analyze its representation in the Bloch sphere. For a general \(2 \times 2\) density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(I\) is the identity matrix. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

This implies that the term \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) must be zero. Since the Pauli matrices are non-zero, the only way this can happen is if \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the Bloch vector is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the completely mixed state.

Among the given options, the only one that matches the Bloch vector \((0, 0, 0)\) is **C**. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin.

Answer: C
