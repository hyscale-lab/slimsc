Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, let me read the problem again. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors have specific properties.

So the problem is to find the eigenvector of P (which is along direction n in the x-z plane) with eigenvalue ħ/2. Hmm, or wait, no, the operator is P (vector) along n, which would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So the operator simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

First, I think I should write down the matrices for each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So each of these is a 2x2 matrix scaled by ħ/2. Now, the operator along n is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since n_y is zero.

So let me write that out. Let me denote n_x = a and n_z = c (since n is a unit vector, a² + c² = 1).

So P = a P_x + c P_z.

Substituting the matrices:

P = (ħ/2) [ a*[[0,1],[1,0]] + c*[[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So adding the matrices:

First row: [a*0 + c*1 , a*1 + c*0] → [c, a]
Second row: [a*1 + c*0, a*0 + c*(-1)] → [a, -c]

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [[c, a], [a, -c]]

So the operator is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[c, a], [a, -c]]

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0

So substituting P, we have:

(ħ/2)[[c, a], [a, -c]] - (ħ/2) I = 0

Which simplifies to:

(ħ/2) [ [c-1, a], [a, -c-1] ] |v> = 0

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[[c-1, a], [a, -c-1]] |v> = 0

So the matrix equation is:

[(c-1) v1 + a v2 = 0
a v1 + (-c -1) v2 =0 ]

So we have a system of equations:

(1) (c-1)v1 + a v2 = 0
(2) a v1 + (-c-1) v2 =0

Let me see if I can find a non-trivial solution for v1 and v2.

From equation (1):

(c-1) v1 = -a v2
v1 = [ -a/(c-1) ) ] v2

Hmm, but let me make sure that the system is consistent. Let me check the determinant of the matrix. If the determinant is zero, then there's a non-trivial solution.

The determinant of the 2x2 matrix is (c-1)(-c-1) - a².

Expanding that: (c-1)(-c-1) = -(c-1)(c+1) = -(c² -1) = -c² +1

So determinant = (-c² +1) - a².

But a² + c² =1, so substituting:

determinant = (-c² +1) - (1 - c²) = (-c² +1) -1 + c² = 0.

So the determinant is zero, which means we can find non-trivial solutions.

So from equation (1):

v1 = [ -a/(c-1) ] v2

But I can write this as v1 = [ a/(1 - c) ] v2

Let me denote v2 as some parameter, say t.

So v1 = [ a/(1 - c) ] t

But let's think about normalization. The eigenvector should be normalized, so |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 =1.

Wait, but perhaps we can write the eigenvector in terms of two components, and then normalize.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the eigenvector in terms of spherical coordinates or something. Wait, since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the angle θ could be measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since n is in x-z, maybe φ is zero? Or perhaps phi is determined by the direction in x-z, but the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z, so n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating. Let me proceed step by step.

So, going back, the eigenvector condition is:

[(c-1)v1 + a v2 =0
a v1 + (-c-1) v2 =0 ]

We can take the ratio of the two equations to eliminate variables.

Take equation (1) and equation (2):

From equation (1): (c-1)v1 = -a v2 → v1 = (-a/(c-1)) v2

Substitute into equation (2):

a [ (-a/(c-1)) v2 ] + (-c-1) v2 =0

Multiply through:

[-a²/(c-1) v2 ] + (-c-1) v2 =0

Factor out v2:

[ -a²/(c-1) - (c+1) ] v2 = 0

So,

[ (-a² - (c+1)(c-1) ) / (c-1) ] v2 =0

Wait, because (c+1)(c-1) = c² -1.

So numerator is -a² - (c² -1) → - a² - c² +1

But since a² + c² =1,

- a² -c² +1 = -(a² + c²) +1 = -1 +1=0.

So the numerator becomes zero. So the equation is satisfied for any v2, which is consistent with the determinant being zero.

So we can pick v2 = t, then v1 = (-a/(c-1)) t.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (-a/(c-1)), 1 ]

Wait, but perhaps I should express everything in terms of θ, since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Let me think about the angle θ. Let me say that the direction is given by θ, measured from the z-axis. So, for a unit vector in the x-z plane, the components are:

n_x = sinθ (since if θ is the polar angle from z, then x = sinθ cosφ, but since in x-z plane, φ=0, so x= sinθ)
n_z = cosθ

So n_x = a = sinθ, n_z = c = cosθ.

So substituting a = sinθ, c = cosθ.

So the eigenvector components are:

v1 = (-a/(c-1)) t = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] t

Hmm, let's see if we can simplify that expression.

The denominator (cosθ -1) can be written as -2 sin²(θ/2) using the identity cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2). So cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2).

So denominator is -2 sin²(θ/2).

The numerator is -sinθ. But sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So putting it together:

v1 = [ (-2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) ] t

The negatives cancel, and 2 sin² in denominator cancels with 2 sin in numerator.

So:

v1 = [ (2 sin (θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] / ( 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) = [ cos(θ/2) ] / sin(θ/2) ) = cot(θ/2 )

So v1 = cot(θ/2) * t

Wait, because the denominator is (cosθ -1) which is -2 sin²(θ/2), and the numerator is - sinθ = -2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting, v1 = [ - sinθ ] / [ cosθ - 1 ] * t = [ - (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ] / [ - 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] * t

The negatives cancel, and the 2 in numerator and denominator cancel as well.

So v1 = [ sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / sin²(θ/2) ) ] * t = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] * t = cot(θ/2) * t

So v1 = cot(θ/2) * t

And v2 = t.

Wait, but let me check the substitution again. Because a = sinθ, c = cosθ.

So v1 = [ - a/(c -1) ] t = [ - sinθ/(cosθ - 1) ] t

Which is [ - sinθ ] / [ (cosθ - 1) ] = [ - sinθ ] / [ - (1 - cosθ) ] = [ sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ )

Hmm, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting:

v1 = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] = [ cos(θ/2) ) / sin(θ/2) ) ] = cot(θ/2 )

So, v1 = cot(θ/2) * t

v2 = t

So the eigenvector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ] multiplied by t.

But wait, cot(θ/2) can be written in terms of trigonometric identities. Let me see: cot(θ/2) = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ]

So the components are [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ]

We can factor out 1/sin(θ/2), so the vector becomes:

1/sin(θ/2) [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Which is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] / sin(θ/2) = [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ]

Wait, maybe I should express it as [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by 1/sin(θ/2), but perhaps I can write this in terms of a normalized vector.

Wait, if I let the vector be:

v = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] * sqrt( 2/(1 + cosθ) ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute the normalization condition. The vector [v1, v2] should satisfy |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 =1.

So, substituting v1 = cot(θ/2) t and v2 = t.

So |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = |cot(θ/2)|² t² + t² = [ cot²(θ/2) + 1 ] t² = csc²(θ/2) * t²

Because cot²x +1 = csc²x.

So csc²(θ/2) = 1 / sin²(θ/2)

So, [1 / sin²(θ/2) ] * t² =1 → t² = sin²(θ/2) → t= sin(theta/2) or - sin(theta/2)

So choosing t= sin(theta/2), then v1 = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

v2 = t= sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check: [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

The norm is cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) =1, so yes, it's normalized.

Wait, but earlier I thought the vector was [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] multiplied by t, but after normalization, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Hmm, that seems correct.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, the problem mentions that the eigenvector is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I think that's correct.

Wait a second, but in the options, option C is given as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But looking at the options, option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))). Hmm, but our result doesn't have any ħ in the components because the eigenvector's components are dimensionless.
