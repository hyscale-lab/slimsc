Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, maybe it's for something else. Oh, wait, no, wait. Oh right! Red phosphorus with HI is often used in the hydrolysis of alkyl chlorides, especially in the formation of alcohols. But wait, maybe in this case, it's a different kind of reaction. Or perhaps it's about the substitution of a leaving group.

So first, I need to figure out what compound X is. The question gives me the IR and NMR data for X. Let me look at the IR data first. The IR shows strong peaks. The 3400–2500 cm-1 region suggests there might be an -OH group or an N-H stretch. But wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, possible functional groups: maybe a ketone or an ester, given the 1720. Also, considering the aromatic peaks, the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Now the NMR. Let's go through the peaks one by one. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, so maybe an -OH proton, but broad suggests it's not exchanging quickly. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but the integration is 1H. Wait, but an aldehyde is usually around 9.5-10.5, and a broad signal might suggest some exchange, but maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So that's possible. Or maybe an -NH group, but the IR didn't show a strong N-H stretch beyond 3400. Wait, the IR from 3400–2500 could be due to an -OH though. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

The next peak is 8.0 ppm, a doublet integrating 2H. Then 7.2 ppm, another doublet, also 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons are typically split into doublets. So maybe the ring has substituents at para positions. Let's say substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Then, the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Hmm, so 3H as triplet at 0.9 suggests a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H would be a CH(CH3) group, perhaps. Wait, let me think about the splitting. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to some substituents. The 1.7 ppm as m, 2H—could that be part of a CH2 group?

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents. Let's see. The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, substituents at positions 1 and 4. Let's imagine a substituent at position 4 is a methyl group, perhaps. Wait, but looking at the NMR, we have a triplet at 0.9 for 3H, which is a methyl attached to something, maybe an ethyl group.

Wait, another thought. The 1.4 ppm doublet (d) for 3H suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH. So, like a (CH2) group, perhaps. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to both the aromatic ring and another group. Hmm, maybe a structure like CH2CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, putting it all together: the IR has a carbonyl at 1720. If the compound X has a carbonyl group, then perhaps it's an ester or a ketone. But the NMR doesn't have a peak that's a triplet around 4 ppm which would suggest an adjacent O in an ester, like an ethyl ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR in the 2-3 ppm region has some signals. Let me think: the 2.9 ppm could be a CH next to an aromatic ring and another group. The 1.7 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 group adjacent to something.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group. Like a benzophenone derivative, but more likely, given the NMR, the substituents are in a chain attached to the benzene.

Wait, maybe it's a benzyl group attached to a carbonyl. Let me think about the possible structures based on the integration. The aromatic peaks add up to 4H (two doublets with 2H each), so the benzene has two substituents leading to a para-substituted ring.

So, for the substituents, one substituent is a carbonyl group (since the IR has the 1720 peak) and another substituent is an alkyl group.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet for 1H. If that's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have a -COOH group. But wait, another possibility is that it's an aldehyde proton, but the integration is 1H. Wait, aldehyde is typically a triplet (if coupled) or a singlet. Alternatively, an -OH group, like in a phenol, but that's usually broader and maybe not that high. Wait, I'm a bit confused. At 10.5, it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

If compound X has a carboxylic acid group, that would explain the 1720 cm-1 (carbonyl), the broad peak at 10.5 ppm (the -OH of the acid). But then the rest of the NMR would need to fit. So, the benzene has a substituent which is a -COOH group and another substituent which is an alkyl chain.

But wait, looking at the NMR: the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest that the substituent on the benzene is an electron-withdrawing group. Because in a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, the protons are more deshielded and appear downfield. For example, a nitro group would do that, but also a carbonyl group like a ketone or ester would de-shield the adjacent protons. But if the substituent is a -COOH, which is an electron-withdrawing group, then the ring would have protons in the downfield region.

Wait, but let's think about what the other groups are. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a chain like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? No, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a chain where the benzene is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH, which is connected to a CH(CH3) and then a CH2CH3.

Wait, another approach: the substituent on the benzene is a propanoic acid group. Let me think. If the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-COOH, but that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH3)-COOH?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? Hmm, not sure. Let's see the NMR peaks again. The 0.9 ppm triplet is 3H, which would come from a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet is 3H, which would be a CH3 attached to a CH group. The 1.7 ppm is 2H, which could be a CH2 group. The 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH group.

So, putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but where is the carbonyl?

Wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR is a carbonyl. So maybe the structure has a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be at around 1700 cm-1, but in the IR it's at 1720, which is a bit higher. Wait, carboxylic acids usually have lower wavenumbers for the carbonyl, around 1700. Esters are higher, around 1730-1760. So maybe it's an ester.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet of 1H. If it's an ester, the oxygen is part of the ester group, but where would the proton be? Maybe it's an aldehyde, but that would be a triplet if coupled. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group, but then why is the IR's 3400–2500 region present?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound has a ketone group. Then, the 1720 would be the ketone. The 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton. No, because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But if the carbonyl is a ketone, then where is the 10.5? Hmm, maybe it's an acidic proton, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a -COOR group, but that's an ester.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The 10.5 (1H, bs)—maybe it's an aldehyde. So, if the structure has an aldehyde group, the IR would have a peak around 2800 (stretching for aldehyde C-H), but the IR given is 3400-2500, which is a broad region. Oh, maybe that's from an -OH, but wait, maybe the 3400-2500 is from an aldehyde's C-H stretch. Aldehydes have strong absorption around 2700-2850 cm-1 for the C-H stretch. So that's not matching. Alternatively, O-H stretching would be in the 3400-3200 region. So perhaps the 3400–2500 is a combination of O-H and possibly other groups, but the 1720 is a carbonyl.

Wait, let me try to draw the structure. The benzene ring is para-substituted. One substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, perhaps a ketone or ester, and the other substituent is an alkyl chain.

Looking at the NMR, the 0.9 triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 (2H, m) is a CH2, and the 2.9 (1H, m) is a CH which is connected to the benzene and perhaps the CH2 and the CH3.

So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-something.

Wait, but IR has a carbonyl, so it's either a ketone or an ester. If it's a ketone, then maybe the structure is something like benzyl methyl ketone, but with a longer chain. Let's think: the substituent on the benzene is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO- group. But that would be a ketone, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, but with a carbonyl at one end. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene with a substituent that's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group. Wait, but then the IR would show a carboxylic acid's carbonyl at around 1700 cm-1, but here it's 1720. So maybe it's an ester.

Wait, let's imagine the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOR group, but then the NMR would show the ester's oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzene ring with a group like -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH group. So, the structure could be benzene with a -COOH group attached via a CH2-CH(CH3) chain. That would fit the NMR.

Wait, let's think about the NMR in that case. The aromatic region would have two doublets (para substituents), which it does. The CH2-CH(CH3) would have protons as follows: the CH3 (1.4, d), the CH2 (1.7, m), and the CH (2.9, m). And the COOH would have a proton at 10.5.

So, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH group attached to the benzene in the para position. That would give the structure 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid? Wait, no. Wait, the chain is CH2-CH(CH3)-, so that's a propyl group with a branch. Wait, the structure would be benzoic acid with a substituent that's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group? Wait, no, let me see.

Wait, the substituent is on the benzene. Let's imagine that the benzene has a substituent that's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Wait, but that would make the substituent longer. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that might not fit the NMR. Let me think: the 0.9 triplet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 doublet (3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. The 1.7 (2H) is a CH2, and the 2.9 (1H) is a CH connected to the benzene.

So, the substituent would be something like CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. So, the structure would be benzene with a substituent in the para position which is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, and perhaps a carbonyl group attached somewhere.

Wait, but the IR has
