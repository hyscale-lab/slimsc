Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure how to approach it, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are provided as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Wait, what's a stability constant? Oh right, the stability constant (β) is a measure of the stability of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is. So the complex with the highest β will dominate, but wait, we're looking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the one with two SCN^- ligands.

Hmm, but first, I need to figure out which complex is which. The stability constants are given in order, so β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So for Co(SCN)_n^2−n complexes, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN^- ions.

So the complexes would be:

- Co(SCN)^- : β1 =9
- Co(SCN)₂: β2=40
- Co(SCN)₃: β3=63
- Co(SCN)₄^2−: β4=16

Wait, but wait a second. For the nth complex, the formation constant is given by βn = [Co(SCN)_n^{2-}]/([Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n). So each βn is the constant for the step where the nth SCN^- is added.

But wait, the overall formation constants for each possible complex. So the first complex is Co(SCN), which has β1=9. The second complex would have two SCN ligands, so the formation constant for that step is β2=40. Wait, but the overall β for Co(SCN)₂ would be β1 * β2, right? Because forming the first complex is β1, and then the second SCN adds with β2.

Wait no, actually, the overall stability constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Because each step is multiplied. So for the first complex, it's β1. The second complex has overall β_total = β1 * β2, the third is β1 * β2 * β3, etc.

Wait, but wait, the way the problem is stated, I'm a bit confused. So the stability constants given are for each step. So the first complex CoSCN^+ (if Co^2+ and SCN^- are -1 each) would have β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9. The second complex would be Co(SCN)₂, which would have a stepwise β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-})=40. So the total β for Co(SCN)_2 would be β1 * β2 =9 *40=360. Similarly, the next step, β3=63, so the third complex would have β_total = 9*40*63=22680. And the fourth complex would have β_total = 9*40*63*16. Let me compute that quickly: 9 *40 is 360, *63 is 22680, *16 is 362880.

But wait, the problem is that when considering the distribution of species, each complex's concentration depends on its stability. The most stable complex (highest β) would be the one with the most SCN ligands, assuming the concentration of SCN^- is sufficient.

But wait, in this problem, the [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M, which is relatively high. So maybe the higher-order complexes are more favored.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN ligands, right? So that's Co(SCN)₂. So we need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)₂ among all the cobalt species present.

So the approach would be to calculate the fraction of each cobalt species and then sum them up, but particularly focus on the fraction of the second complex (Co(SCN)₂).

But how to compute that? I think we need to use the formation constants and the concentrations to find the distribution of each species.

Let me think. Let's denote the species as:

Co^2+ → free ion.

CoSCN^+ → monosubstituted.

Co(SCN)₂ → disubstituted.

Co(SCN)₃ → trisubstituted.

Co(SCN)₄^2− → tetrasubstituted.

Each of these will have their own concentrations, and the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these.

The total [Co] is given as 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, but how to approach this? The problem resembles the calculation of the distribution of metal complexes in solution, given the various formation constants. The way to approach this is by using the formation constants and the concentrations to find the relative populations of each complex.

Let me set up the variables.

Let’s denote:

[Co^2+] = C0

[CoSCN^+] = x1

[Co(SCN)₂] = x2

[Co(SCN)₃] = x3

[Co(SCN)₄^2−] = x4

The total cobalt concentration is C_total = C0 + x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 1e-2 M.

But since the formation of complexes depends on the availability of Co^2+ and SCN^-, we can write expressions for each species in terms of C0 and the formation constants.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, we can use the method of successive approximations or consider the dominant species.

Alternatively, the log β approach could be helpful, but perhaps an easier way is to consider the relative populations based on the formation constants and the concentrations.

Wait, another approach is to use the concept of conditional formation constants. The conditional constant (Kf') considers the free ion concentration, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the ratio of each species' concentration based on the successive formation constants.

But perhaps a more structured approach would be to write the equilibrium expressions for each complex.

So the first complex is:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+; β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-}) =9.

The second complex is:

CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)₂; β2= [Co(SCN)₂]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-})=40.

Third complex:

Co(SCN)₂ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)₃; β3=63.

Fourth complex:

Co(SCN)₃ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)₄^2−; β4=16.

So with each step, the formation constant for the next complex is given.

Now, the key is to express each species in terms of the initial [Co^2+], which is C0.

Wait, but in reality, [Co^2+] is not just C0 because some of it is tied up in complexes. But let me think about how to express each x in terms of [Co^2+].

Let me consider that:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] = β1 * C0 * [SCN^-]

Wait, but [Co^2+] is C0 minus the sum of all complexes. Hmm, but that's a bit circular.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express each subsequent species in terms of the previous one.

Expressing each species in terms of [Co^2+], perhaps.

Let’s denote [Co^2+] as x, then:

x1 = [CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-]

x2 = [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x1 * [SCN^-] = β2 * β1 x [SCN^-]^2

x3 = β3 * x2 * [SCN^-] = β3 * β2 β1 x [SCN^-]^3

x4 = β4 * x3 * [SCN^-] = β4 β3 β2 β1 x [SCN^-]^4

So each step builds on the previous.

But the total [Co] is x + x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 1e-2 M.

But substituting each term in terms of x:

Total Co = x + (β1 x [SCN^-]) + (β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2) + (β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4) ) = 1e-2.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term's coefficient:

Term for x: 1.

Term for x1: β1 * [SCN^-] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term for x2: β1* β2 * [SCN^-]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6.

Wait, wait, that's 9*40 = 360, times (0.1)^2=0.01 → 360 * 0.01=3.6.

Term for x3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 = 9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3.

Compute that: 9*40=360, *63=22680. (0.1)^3=0.001. So 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term for x4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 =9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute step by step: 9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880. (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Now, putting all into the equation:

Total Co = x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68 x +36.288 x = 1e-2.

Factor out x:

x (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) = 1e-2.

Compute the sum inside the parentheses:

1 +0.9=1.9.

+3.6 → 5.5.

+22.68 → 28.18.

+36.288 → 64.468.

So x * 64.468 = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Wait, but that's [Co^2+] = x ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Now, compute each species' concentration:

x1 = β1 x [SCN] =9 * 1.551e-4 *0.1 = 9 *1.551e-5 →≈1.396e-4 M.

x2 = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 =9*40 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2 → 360 *1.551e-4 *0.01 =360 *1.551e-6 ≈5.5836e-4 M.

x3 = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 =9*40*63 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^3 → 22680 *1.551e-4 *0.001.

Wait, 22680 *1.551e-4 is 22680 *0.0001551 ≈3.52e0 (since 22680 *0.0001 is 2.268, and 22680 *0.0000551 → approx 1.247, total ≈3.515). Then multiply by 0.001 → 0.003515 M.

x3≈0.003515 M.

x4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 → 9*40*63*16 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880.

Multiply by 1.551e-4 →362880 * 1.551e-4 → approx 56.17 (since 362880 *1e-4 =36.288, and 362880 *5.51e-5= approx 20, so total around 56.288).

Then multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001 →56.288 *0.0001=0.0056288 M.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recompute x4.

x4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 * x * [SCN]^4.

Compute the constants first: 9 *40 =360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

So [SCN]^4 is (0.1)^4=0.0001.

So 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Then multiply by x=1.551e-4 → x4=36.288 *1.551e-4.

36.288 *1.551e-4. Let's compute that.

36.288 * 1.551 = approx 56.28 (because 36 *1.5=54, plus 0.288*1.5=0.432, so about 54.432)

But wait, 36.288 *1.551:

Let me compute it more accurately.

36 *1.551 = 55.836.

0.288 *1.551 = approx 0.446.

So total is about 56.282.

So 56.282e-4 → 5.6282e-3 M.

Wait, but 56.282e-4 is 0.0056282 M.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, so x4= (9 *40 *63 *16) * x * (0.1)^4.

Which is 362880 * x * 0.0001.

So 362880 *0.0001 =36.288.

Multiply by x=1.551e-4 →36.288 *1.551e-4.

Which equals 36.288 *1.551e-4.

Let me compute 36.288 *1.551.

36 *1.551 = 55.836.

0.288 *1.551 = 0.446.

So total is approximately 56.282.

Multiply by 1e-4 →56.282e-4 →0.0056282 M.

Hmm, but this would mean x4 is about 0.005628 M.

But wait, the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. Let's add up all the x terms:

x=1.551e-4 ≈0.0001551 M.

x1≈1.396e-4 ≈0.0001396.

x2≈5.5836e-4 ≈0.00055836.

x3≈0.003515.

x4≈0.0056282.

Wait, let me sum these:

x: 0.0001551 → 0.0001551.

x1: 0.0001396 → total so far 0.0002947.

x2: 0.00055836 → total 0.00085306.

x3: 0.003515 → total 0.00436806.

x4: 0.0056282 → total 0.01 (exactly 0.01), which matches the given total Co concentration. So that's correct.

So the concentrations are:

Co^2+: 0.0001551 M.

CoSCN^+: 0.0001396 M.

Co(SCN)₂: 0.00055836 M.

Co(SCN)₃: 0.003515 M.

Co(SCN)₄^2−: 0.0056282 M.

Wait, but wait a second. The total is 0.01 M, but when I add all the x terms, I get 0.0001551 +0.0001396=0.0002947; plus x2 (0.00055836) → 0.00085306; plus x3 (0.003515) → 0.00436806; plus x4 (0.0056282) → 0.0100.

Yes, that adds up correctly.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)₂, so x2 is 0.00055836 M.

Wait, but wait, in the options, the percentages are in the range of 16.9% to 42.3%. But according to these calculations, the concentration of x2 is 0.00055836 M, and the total Co is 0.01 M. So the fraction is 0.00055836 / 0.01 = 0.055836, which is 5.58%. But that's not among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, that's confusing. So either my approach is wrong, or perhaps I messed up the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-examine the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the way I represented the species and their formation is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that all the species are formed stepwise with the given β values is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: maybe the β values given are the overall stability constants for each complex, not the stepwise. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the β values.

Wait, the problem statement says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Are these the stepwise constants or the overall constants?

In the formation of metal complexes, the stability constants (β) are often given as the overall constant for the n ligand complex. For example, the overall β for Co(SCN)_n would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But if the given β's are the stepwise constants, then the overall β for the second
