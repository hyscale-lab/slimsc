Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, which I'm a bit rusty on, but let me try to work through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.

Alright, first, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula derived from the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices of the plane. For a cubic crystal, the formula is straightforward, but rhombohedral is a bit more complex because all the edges are the same length, but the angles between them aren't 90 degrees. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, a=b=c, but the angles α, β, γ are all equal, but they're not 90 degrees. In this case, each angle is 30 degrees.

So I think the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is similar to the cubic case but adjusted for the angles. The general formula for d_hkl in a crystal is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl)/(2a²) * (cos α + cos β + cos γ) + (hk cos α cos β + hl cos α cos γ + kl cos β cos γ)/(a²) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because all a, b, c are equal. Let me think. Oh right, when a = b = c = a0, and the angles between the axes are all equal (like in a rhombohedral), the interplanar distance can be found using a modified version of the Miller indices formula.

The general formula for d_hkl in a crystal is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl)(cos α + cos β + cos γ)/(1 + cos α cos β cos γ - sqrt[ (cos α cos β + cos α cos γ + cos β cos γ)² - (cos α sin²β + cos β sin²γ + cos γ sin²α) ]) )

Wait, this seems too complicated. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. I think that for a rhombohedral structure, there might be a simpler formula because the unit cell is a rhombohedron. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = (a0) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, no, wait, that's maybe for a hexagonal or something else. Oh wait, no, wait a second. In a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for a rhombohedral, the formula is a bit different because of the angles between the lattice vectors.

I think the correct formula for rhombohedral is:

d^2 = (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2a² (hk + hl + kl) cos α ) / (1 + cos α (h² + k² + l²) + ... )

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh, wait, no, I can't do that right now, so I'll try to think logically.

In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell has vectors a, b, c all equal in length, a0, but the angles between them are all equal, say θ (which is 30 degrees here). The interplanar distance for a given (hkl) plane is given by:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, that seems familiar. Because in a cubic system, cos θ is zero (since angles are 90 degrees), so the formula reduces to the standard d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²).

So for our case, since θ is 30 degrees, cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

The problem asks for the (111) plane, so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging into the formula:

d = a0 / sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) - 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos 30 )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, a0 is given as 10 Angstrom.

Compute the denominator terms:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, 2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = 2*(1+1+1) = 2*3=6.

Multiply that by cos(30) which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that can't be right because you can't take the square root of a negative number. So that would imply a problem. But that can't be correct because the interplanar distance must be a positive real number.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Another approach: The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral lattice is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α + 2(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (something) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should refer to the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, gamma.

The general formula is:

d² = 1/( (h²/(a^2) ) + (k²/(b^2) ) + (l²/(c^2)) ) + (2 hk cos γ)/(a b) + (2 hl cos β)/(a c) + (2 kl cos α)/(b c) )

But this is for a general hexagonal or triclinic system. But in the case of a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and the angles alpha=beta=gamma=θ=30 degrees.

So substituting, the formula becomes:

d² = 1/( (h² +k² + l²)/(a0^2) ) + (2 hk cos θ)/(a0^2) + (2 hl cos θ)/(a0^2) + (2 kl cos θ)/(a0^2) )

Wait, no, let me correct that. The general formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2(hk cos gamma)/(a b) - 2(hl cos beta)/(a c) - 2(kl cos alpha)/(b c) )

Wait, that's the correct formula for 1/d² in a general crystal.

So in a rhombohedral case, a = b = c = a0, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So substituting, 1/d² becomes:

( h² + k² + l² ) / a0² - 2 ( hk cos 30 + hl cos30 + kl cos30 ) / ( a0² )

Because when a = b = a0, then (hk cos gamma) becomes (h k cos theta), because gamma is 30 degrees.

Wait, let me make that substitution:

1/d² = [h² +k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ] / a0²

Ah, that looks better.

So, d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, that must be the correct formula. Because if θ is 90 degrees, then cos θ is zero, and the formula reduces to d = a0 / sqrt(h² +k² + l² ), which is correct for the cubic case.

So with that formula, let's proceed.

For the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plug in the numbers:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) )= 2*3=6.

cos(theta)=cos(30 degrees)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2))

Compute 6 * sqrt(3)/2 = 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. So the square root would be imaginary, which can't be correct. That suggests I made an error in the formula.

Wait, this can't be right. Because if the denominator inside the square root becomes negative, it would imply that the interplanar distance is imaginary, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a plus or minus sign somewhere. Let me re-examine the formula.

Wait, the correct formula from the general case is:

1/d² = [h² + k² + l²]/(a²) - [ 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ]/(a² )

In this case, gamma is the angle between a and b, beta between a and c, alpha between b and c. But in rhombohedral, all angles are 30 degrees.

So,

1/d² = (3)/(a0²) - [ 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 ) ]/(a0² )

= (3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2 )) / (a0² )

= (3 - 3*sqrt(3)) ) / (a0² )

Hmm, 3*sqrt(3) is approximately 5.196, so 3 -5.196 is about -2.196.

So 1/d² is negative, which would make d² negative, which is impossible. So that suggests I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I have the sign wrong. Let's reevaluate.

The general formula for 1/d² is:

1/d^2 = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) − (2hk cos γ)/(a b) − (2hl cos β)/(a c) − (2kl cos α)/(b c)

Wait, but in rhombohedral, a = b = c =a0, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees.

So substituting, gamma is the angle between a and b, beta between a and c, and alpha between b and c.

Wait, the formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a0² - [ 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha ] / a0²

= [ h² +k² + l² - 2 hk cos gamma - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos alpha ] / a0²

Since all angles are 30 degrees,

= [ 3 - 2*( hk + hl + kl ) * cos 30 ] / a0²

Since hk = 1*1 =1, same for hl and kl.

So, hk + hl + kl =3.

So,

= [3 - 2 *3 * (sqrt(3)/2) ] / a0²

Simplify 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 sqrt(3).

So,

= (3 - 3 sqrt(3)) / a0² 

Which is 3(1 - sqrt(3)) / a0² 

Now, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 1 - sqrt(3) is about -0.732.

So, 3*( -0.732 ) = approx -2.196.

So,

1/d² = -2.196 / (a0^2 )

Which would mean d² is negative. That's impossible.

So, that suggests that for this Miller index (111) in a rhombohedral system with angles of 30 degrees, the interplanar distance is imaginary, which can't be. So, perhaps I've mixed up the angles or the formula is incorrect.

Wait a minute, perhaps the formula actually has a plus instead of a minus? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) + [ 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ]/(a² )

Wait, no, that can't be right either. Because in the cubic case, the angles are 90, so cos gamma etc. are zero, leading to 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a², which is correct. So the formula must have a negative sign.

But in this case
