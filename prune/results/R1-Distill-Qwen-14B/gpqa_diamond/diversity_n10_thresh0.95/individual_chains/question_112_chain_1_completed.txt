Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Then, we're supposed to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. So first, I need to figure out what the state |alpha> is, and then find the probabilities for the given operator. Then compute the average.

Wait, the operator's matrix is given. Let me think about the structure of this operator. The matrix is 2x2 because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles. So, for a 2x2 matrix, the elements Aij are hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the question says Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0     ]

Wait, but this matrix is symmetric, right? So it's a symmetric 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So what's the operator's eigenstates?

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of such a matrix can be found. Let me recall that for a 2x2 matrix [[0, a],[a, 0]], the eigenvalues are ±a. Because the trace is zero, and the determinant is -a². So eigenvalues are sqrt(-det) and -sqrt(-det), which here would be ±a. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, when the matrix is [[0, a],[a, 0]], the eigenvalues are found by solving (0 - λ)^2 - a^2 = 0 → λ² = a² → λ=±a. So yeah, the eigenvalues are plus and minus a. So in our case, a is hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the operator in question has eigenstates |+> and |-> with eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

But wait, the original state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of the z-component of spin. So |up> is spin-up along z, and |down> is spin-down along z. But the operator we're considering here is not the z-component but something else. So we need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of the new operator to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the eigenvectors of the operator A and express |alpha> in terms of those, then the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes.

So to find the eigenvectors of matrix A:

The matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Let's find its eigenvectors. For eigenvalue +hbar/2: solving (A - (hbar/2)I)|v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes [[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]]. The equations are:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1, 1]^T.

Similarly, for eigenvalue -hbar/2:

(A - (-hbar/2) I) = [[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]]. Equations:

(hbar/2)v1 + (hbar/2)v2 = 0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are [1, -1]^T.

But wait, these are the eigenvectors, but they're not normalized. So the normalized eigenvectors would be:

For eigenvalue +hbar/2: (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1]^T → |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

For eigenvalue -hbar/2: (1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1]^T → |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, let me make sure. Because |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of Sz (z-component spin). The states |+> and |-> I just wrote are eigenstates of Sx, perhaps? Because the matrix A might correspond to the x-component spin operator.

Wait, the spin matrices are Sx = ħ/2 [[0,1],[1,0]], Sy = ħ/2 [[0,-i],[i,0]], Sz = ħ/2 [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the matrix A is exactly Sx. Because Sx has 0 on the diagonal, and 1 (times ħ/2) on the off-diagonal. So yes, the operator A is the Sx operator.

So the eigenstates are the x-up and x-down states, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

So, the state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, but we need to express it in terms of |+> and |-> (the eigenstates of A) to find the probabilities.

The given state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

Wait, the question says it's proportional. So |alpha> = C[(1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>], where C is a normalization constant.

So first, let's compute C. The normalization is |C|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 ] = 1.

Compute |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 =2.

Compute |2 -i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2=4+1=5.

So total inside the brackets is 2+5=7. So |C|^2 *7 =1 → C=1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Now, we need to express this in terms of the |+> and |-> states.

We know that:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

We can express |up> and |down> in terms of |+> and |->:

|up> = (|+> + |-> )/sqrt(2),
|down> = (|+> - |-> )/sqrt(2).

So substituting into |alpha>, let's compute:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) (|+> + |->)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i)(|+> - |->)/sqrt(2) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= (1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))) [ (1+i)(|+> + |->) + (2 -i)(|+> - |->) ]

Let me expand this:

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)|+> + (1+i)|-> + (2 -i)|+> - (2 -i)|-> ]

Combine like terms:

For |+> terms: [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] |+>

For |-> terms: [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] |->

Compute each coefficient:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 +0i =3.

(1+i) - (2 -i) = -1 + 2i.

So,

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) [3 |+> + (-1 +2i)|-> ]

Wait, let me check that:

Wait, 1+i +2 -i = (1+2)+(i -i) = 3 +0i.

And 1 +i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

Yes, correct.

So, |alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) [3 |+> + (-1 +2i) |-> ].

So the coefficients when expressed in |+> and |-> are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probabilities are the square of the absolute values of these coefficients.

Compute probability of |+>:

|3/sqrt(14)|² = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, the probability for |->:

| (-1 +2i) / sqrt(14) |² = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, wait, but 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.357. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which seems close. But others have different numbers.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me check the expansion again.

Wait, when I expanded |alpha>, the coefficients were:

3 |+> and (-1 +2i)|->.

So the amplitude for |+> is 3/sqrt(14), for |-> it's (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

So their squares:

|3/sqrt(14)|² =9/14 ≈0.642857.

|(-1+2i)/sqrt(14)|²= (1^2 + (2)^2)/14 =5/14≈0.357143.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches approximately. But let me check the other options.

But wait, the question is about the operator whose matrix is A. So probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

So 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is about 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36.

So that would make the first part of option A correct. The average value of the operator would be the expectation value of A in state |alpha>.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is the Sx operator, which has eigenvalues ±hbar/2, the expectation value is the sum of probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So, <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [9/14 -5/14 ] (hbar/2 )= (4/14)(hbar/2) = (2/7)(hbar/2) = hbar/7.

So the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that matches.

Wait, but wait. Let me recompute the expectation value another way to be sure.

Alternatively, compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Express |alpha> as (1/sqrt(14)) [3 |+> + (-1 +2i)|-> ].

But A|+> = (hbar/2)|+>, A|-> = (-hbar/2)|->.

Wait no, wait: A is the operator whose matrix is Aij. Wait, the operator A has eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2, right?

Wait, because earlier I thought that since A is Sx, it's eigenvalues are ±hbar/2.

So A |+> = (hbar/2)|+>, A |-> = (-hbar/2)|->.

So, <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) [3 <+| + (-1+2i) < - | ] A (1/sqrt(14)) [3 |+> + (-1+2i) |-> ]

Multiply constants:

(1/14) [3 <+| + (-1+2i) < - | ] [3 |+> + (-1+2i) |-> ]

Apply A:

Since A|+> = (hbar/2)|+>, and A|-> = (-hbar/2)|->.

So,

= (1/14) [3 <+| (hbar/2)|+> + 3 <+| (-hbar/2) |-> + (-1+2i) < - | (hbar/2)|+> + (-1+2i) < - | (-hbar/2)|-> ]

Wait, but <+| -> = 0 because |+> and |-> are orthogonal.

So terms where the bra and ket are different will be zero. So only terms where the same state are present contribute.

So,

= (1/14) [ 3*(hbar/2) <+|+> + (-1+2i)*(-hbar/2) < - | - > ]

Because the other terms (like <+| - >) are zero.

So compute each term:

3*(hbar/2) * (1) = 3 hbar /2.

(-1 +2i)*(-hbar/2) * (1) = (1 -2i) * (hbar/2).

Wait, wait. Let me compute each part.

First term: 3*(hbar/2) * <+|+> → 3*(hbar/2)*1= 3hbar/2.

Second term: [ (-1 +2i) * (-hbar/2) ] * < - | - > → [ (1-2i) * (hbar/2) ] *1 = (1-2i) hbar/2.

So the sum is 3hbar/2 + (1-2i)hbar/2.

Combine terms:

= [ (3 +1 -2i ) * hbar/2 ].

Wait, 3hbar/2 is the same as (3 hbar)/2, and the second term is (1 -2i) hbar/2.

So adding them:

(3 +1 -2i) * hbar/2 = (4 -2i) hbar/2 = (2 -i) hbar.

Wait, but that can't be right because the expectation value should be real, as the operator is Hermitian and the expectation in a state should be real.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, because I'm mixing up the components. Wait, the expectation value is <A> = sum (a_i λ_i ), where a_i are the coefficients, and λ_i the eigenvalues. So it should be real. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the expansion approach is getting complicated. Let me try another way.

Since |alpha> is a linear combination of |+> and |->,

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->,

then <A> = |c_+|^2 (hbar/2) + |c_-|^2 (-hbar/2).

Because A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2.

So, we already calculated |c_+|^2 =9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [ (9 -5)/14 ] (hbar/2 ) = (4/14)(hbar/2 )= (2/7)(hbar/2 )= hbar/(7).

Yes, that's correct. So the average is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357, and average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. That matches.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46, 3 hbar/sqrt(7).

Option C: 0.28, 0.72, hbar/sqrt(7).

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, 2 hbar/sqrt(7).

So option A is the one with the correct average value. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let me compute 9/14 as a decimal.

14 into 9: 0.642857..., which is approximately 0.64. 5/14 is 0.35714, which is about 0.36. So option A is correct.

So the answer should be option A.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of a given operator and finding the average value of that operator. The state of the electron is given as proportional to \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The operator in question has a matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. This operator corresponds to the \( S_x \) spin operator, which has eigenstates \( |+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( | \alpha \rangle \)
The state \( | \alpha \rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the normalization constant \( C \) using the condition \( |C|^2 \left( |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 \right) = 1 \). 

- \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \)
- \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \)

Thus, \( |C|^2 (2 + 5) = 1 \), so \( |C|^2 = \frac{1}{7} \) and \( C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \). The normalized state is:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Express \( | \alpha \rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
Using the relations \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+\rangle + |-\rangle) \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+\rangle - |-\rangle) \), substitute these into \( | \alpha \rangle \):

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+\rangle + |-\rangle) + (2-i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+\rangle - |-\rangle) \right].
\]

Factor out \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \):

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i)(|+\rangle + |-\rangle) + (2-i)(|+\rangle - |-\rangle) \right].
\]

Expand and combine terms:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right)|+\rangle + \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right)|-\rangle \right].
\]

Simplify the coefficients:

- Coefficient of \( |+\rangle \): \( (1+i) + (2-i) = 3 \),
- Coefficient of \( |-\rangle \): \( (1+i) - (2-i) = -1 + 2i \).

Thus:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|+\rangle + (-1+2i)|-\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 3: Calculate probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are the square of the absolute values of the coefficients:

- Probability of \( |+\rangle \): \( \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6428 \),
- Probability of \( |-\rangle \): \( \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{1^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571 \).

### Step 4: Calculate the average value of the operator
The average value of the operator is given by \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \left( \frac{9}{14} \right) \frac{\hbar}{2} + \left( \frac{5}{14} \right) \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \right) = \frac{9}{14} \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{4}{14} \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{2}{7} \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
