Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function. Let me think through this step by step.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, I remember that wave functions in quantum mechanics must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. Oh right, the total probability of finding the particle in all space must equal 1.

The problem says that when measuring the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, but wait, the given wave function doesn't seem to have any zeros except based on its form. Oh wait, probably the wave function as given is non-zero only between 1 and 3, meaning that the probability is zero elsewhere. Or maybe the wave function is zero outside, but the given expression is for the region between 1 and 3.

Wait, the problem states that the wave function in a part of space where it can exist is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So perhaps this is the form within x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Or maybe the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, but the expression given is valid there. So the wave function is zero outside 1<x<3.

But wait, the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex function, which is fine. For a valid wave function, the integral of the absolute square must be 1.

So the probability density is |ψ|², which is ψ multiplied by its complex conjugate. Let me write that out.

ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i
The complex conjugate ψ* would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying these gives:
|ψ|^2 = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5)^2 
Because when you multiply (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b².

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but this would be the density only where the wave function is non-zero, which is between x=1 and x=3. Elsewhere, the density is zero. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ|^2 dx must be 1.

So the integral becomes:

∫ from 1 to3 [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me split this integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

The first integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the equation is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Solving for a²:

a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2)
Which is 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Then a is sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait a second, did I consider that the wave function might not be square-integrable? Because if the wave function is zero outside 1 to3, and the given expression is within that interval, then the integral is over 1 to3 as I did. So yes, the approach seems correct.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions in quantum mechanics: the total probability of finding the particle in all space must equal 1. The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), and zero elsewhere.

The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \psi(x) \cdot \psi^*(x) \), where \( \psi^*(x) \) is the complex conjugate of \( \psi(x) \). Substituting \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we find:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \):  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \), we get:
   \[
   \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]
   Thus, the first term becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \):  
   This evaluates to \( 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5 \).

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.849 \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
