Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain properties. When the star doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000K, and its radius is 1.5 solar radii, mass 1.1 solar masses. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. 

The main issue is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So the ratio N1/N2 (number of atoms in level 1 over level 2) decreases when spots are present. So without spots, the ratio is higher. The question is asking for the factor, which is N1/N2 (no spots) divided by N1/N2 (spots). So factor = (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

But wait, the ratio decreases, so N1/N2 is higher when there are no spots. So the factor would be greater than 1.

But how do the spots affect this ratio? Let me think about the physics involved.

In the stellar photosphere, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:

N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2 > E1, so the exponent is negative.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. But wait, is that relevant for this problem? Because the question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels, which depends on the temperature.

So the ratio depends on the temperature via the exponential term. So when the star's overall temperature changes, the ratio changes.

Wait, but the star isn't uniformly at the same temperature when spots are present. Spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall observed Teff is 5500K, but what about the temperature in the regions without spots?

Wait, but the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So I think that the problem is considering the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. Or maybe not? Hmm, that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's total luminosity is such that the effective temperature is 5500K when 40% of the surface is spotted. But the unspotted regions are at a higher temperature.

Wait, but that complicates things a bit. Because the star's total flux would be a combination of the spotted and unspotted parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500K when spots are present. But that doesn't make much sense physically because the spots are cooler regions. So maybe the average temperature is lower, but the unspotted regions are hotter.

Wait, but the photospheric effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity and radius. So when the spots are present, the star's luminosity decreases, but the radius remains the same (since spots are on the surface, not changing the size). So according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πR²σTeff^4. If 40% of the surface is cooler, the total luminosity would be less than when the surface is uniform at 6000K.

Wait, but the question says that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000K. When 40% is covered by spots, the Teff is 5500K. So Teff is calculated as the effective temperature based on the total luminosity, assuming a uniform blackbody.

But in reality, the star isn't at uniform temperature. So the actual temperature in the unspotted regions must be higher than 5500 K, and the spotted regions are lower.

But how does this affect the photospheric conditions? The problem states that in the photosphere, when examining the Ti levels, the ratio decreases when spots are present.

Hmm. So the photosphere's temperature plays a role here. But when the star has spots, the photosphere's temperature isn't uniform. But the question says that when you look at the photosphere, the overall effective temperature is 5500K. So perhaps the problem is simplifying things by considering the entire photosphere's average as 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but if the spots are cooler and cover 40% of the area, the average temperature (as seen from the star's emission) would be lower. So the photospheric regions without spots would be hotter than 6000 K? Or wait, no. Because the unspotted regions would be at a higher temperature than the average, but the spots are lower.

Wait, perhaps the effective temperature is an average, but the actual photospheric regions where the Ti atoms are present are either at the higher (unspotted) or lower (spotted) temperatures.

But the problem says the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So maybe the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when the spots are present. But that can't be right because the rest of the photosphere would have to be hotter to compensate for the spots.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the observed Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. But the actual temperature in the unspotted regions would be higher than 6000 K.

Wait, let me think about the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The star's luminosity L is 4πR²σTeff^4. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, let's say the temperature of the spots is T_spot, and the rest (60%) is at T_unspot.

So the total luminosity would be L = (0.6)*A_unspot * σ T_unspot^4 + (0.4)*A_spot * σ T_spot^2.

But since the radius is the same, A_unspot = 0.6 A_total, A_spot = 0.4 A_total.

So L = A_total * σ [0.6 T_unspot^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4].

The effective temperature when spots are present is 5500 K. So,

L = 4π R² σ (5500)^4.

But when there are no spots, L = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

So setting the two expressions for L equal when spots are present:

4π R² σ (5500)^4 = A_total σ [0.6 T_unspot^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ]

But A_total is 4π R², so 4π R² cancels out. So,

(5500)^4 = 0.6 T_unspot^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4.

But I don't know T_spot. Hmm, but maybe I can make an assumption that the spots are much cooler, so T_spot << T_unspot.

But wait, the problem doesn't give T_spot. So perhaps this approach isn't the right way. Maybe the question is simplifying and considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but that's not accurate because the star would have a mix of temperatures. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K, but the regions without spots are at 6000 K. So the effective temperature is lower, but the unspotted regions are at the original Teff.

Wait, that makes more sense. So let me rephrase.

When the star has no spots, the entire photosphere is at 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, but the spotted regions are cooler.

So the total luminosity would be:

L = (0.6) * (6000^4) + (0.4) * (T_spot^4).

But the overall effective temperature is 5500 K, so:

4π R² σ (5500)^4 = 4π R² σ [ (0.6)(6000^4) + (0.4)(T_spot^4) ]

Wait, wait. No, because the luminosity when spots are present is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions.

So,

L_with_spots = 0.6 * L_unspot + 0.4 * L_spot.

But L_unspot is the luminosity per unit area at 6000 K, so L_unspot = sigma * (6000)^4.

Similarly, L_spot = sigma * T_spot^4.

So,

L_with_spots = 0.6 sigma (6000^4) + 0.4 sigma T_spot^4.

But L_with_spots is also equal to sigma (5500)^4 * 4 pi R^2 / (4 pi R^2) )? Wait, no, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So,

4 pi R^2 sigma (5500)^4 = 0.6 sigma (6000^4) * 4 pi R^2 + 0.4 sigma T_spot^4 * 4 pi R^2

Divide both sides by 4 pi R^2 sigma:

(5500)^4 = 0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*T_spot^4.

So,

0.4*T_spot^4 = (5500)^4 - 0.6*(6000)^4.

Compute that.

First, compute each term.

Let me compute (5500)^4 and (6000)^4.

But maybe it's easier to compute in terms of 1e4:

5500 = 5.5e3, so (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e14.

Similarly, 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

So,

0.6*(6000^4) = 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

(5500)^4 = 9.150625e14.

So,

0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

So T_spot^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root:

T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Compute that.

First, let's compute 3.4365625e14.

Wait, 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4, because (1e3.5)^4 = (1e3.5)^2 squared = (1e7) squared = 1e14.

Wait, 10^3.5 is approx 3162.3, so 3162.3^4 is (3162.3^2)^2.

3162.3^2 is about 1e7, so 3162.3^4 is 1e14.

So, 3.43656e14 is 3.43656 times 1e14.

So the fourth root is (3.43656)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4) = (3.43656)^(1/4) * 1e3.5.

1e3.5 is about 3162.3 K.

What is 3.43656^(1/4)?

Let me compute ln(3.43656) = approx 1.234.

Divide by 4: 0.3085.

Exponentiate: e^0.3085 ≈ 1.36.

So T_spot ≈ 1.36 * 3162.3 ≈ 4312 K.

So the spots are about 4312 K.

But wait, is that correct? Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 0.6*(6000)^4 = 0.6*(1.296e15) = 7.776e14.

(5500)^4 = 5.5^4 *1e12. 5.5^4 is (5.5^2)^2 = (30.25)^2 = 915.0625. So 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So 0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

So T_spot^4 = 1.374625e14 /0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Fourth root: 3.4365625e14^(1/4) = (3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4).

(1e14)^(1/4) = (1e3.5)^4 → 1e3.5 is about 3162.3, so (1e3.5)^4 is 1e14.

So (3.4365625)^(1/4).

Let me compute 3.4365625^(0.25).

I know that 3^0.25 is about 1.316, 4^0.25 is 1.414.

3.4365625 is closer to 3.375, which is 27/8. 3.375^(0.25) = (3.375)^(1/4). Let me compute.

3.375 = 3.375.

Take square root: sqrt(3.375) ≈ 1.837. Then sqrt again: sqrt(1.837) ≈ 1.355.

Wait, but 3.4365625 is a bit higher. So let's compute ln(3.4365625) = approx 1.234.

Divide by 4: 0.3085.

e^0.3085 is about 1.36.

So T_spot ≈ 1.36 *3162.3 ≈ 4309 K.

So the spots are at about 4309 K.

But okay, so the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, the spotted at ~4300 K.

Now, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So the photosphere is a mix of regions at different temperatures.

But wait, the photosphere is in LTE, so each region's contribution to the line emission depends on its temperature and area. So when we observe the ratio, it's a combination of the two regions.

Wait, but the ratio is observed as a change—so when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the overall ratio is a combination of the two regions (unspotted and spotted), weighted by their contributions.

So the observed ratio N1/N2 is the sum of the contributions from each region, weighted by their surface area and the strength of the spectral line from each region.

Alternatively, perhaps the line is formed in the photosphere, which is a mix of regions at 6000 K and 4300 K. So the equivalent width of the line and the ratio would be a combination of the two.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again about what affects the ratio N1/N2.

The ratio is given by N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, E2 > E1, so the ratio depends exponentially on 1/T.

In the unspotted regions, T is 6000 K, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, leading to a larger ratio N1/N2.

In the spotted regions, T is lower (4300 K), so (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, leading to a smaller ratio N1/N2.

When the star has spots, the observed ratio is a combination of both regions. So the overall ratio is a weighted average of the two ratios from each region.

But wait, the transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet or far ultraviolet. Ti lines in this region are probably formed in the photosphere.

So when we observe the ratio N1/N2, it's influenced by both the hotter and cooler regions.

The observed ratio would be the sum of the contributions from each part, but how exactly?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average temperature of the photosphere when spots are present. But that seems unclear.

Wait, the problem says that when spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present.

But that doesn't make sense because the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K. However, maybe in the photosphere, the temperature varies, so the average is 5500 K.

But for the purpose of this problem, maybe we can consider that the temperature of the photosphere when spots are present is T = 5500 K, and when not, it's 6000 K.

But that would simplify the problem a lot. So perhaps that's the approach we're intended to take.

So, the ratio of N1/N2 when there are no spots is given by:

R_no_spots = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k * 6000) )

And when there are spots, it's:

R_with_spots = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k * 5500) )

Wait, but the problem says that when spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when there are spots, which can't be true—because part of the surface is hotter. But perhaps the problem is simplifying, and we take T =5500 K when spots are present.

But then the ratio would change based on T. Since 5500 < 6000, the exponent would be larger, so the exponential term would be smaller, leading to a smaller ratio. Which aligns with the problem statement that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

So, the factor by which the ratio changes is R_no_spots / R_with_spots.

So,

Factor = [ exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k * 5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp [ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me compute the exponents:

The numerator has exponent -(E2-E1)/(k * 6000), denominator has exponent -(E2-E1)/(k *5500).

So,

Factor = exp [ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) ]

Wait, no, because:

Factor = exp( A ) / exp( B ) = exp( A - B )

Where A = -(E2-E1)/(k * 6000)

B = -(E2-E1)/(k *5500)

So,

A - B = [ -(E2-E1)/(k *6000) ) ] - [ -(E2-E1)/(k *5500) ) ]

= (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Find a common denominator: 5500 *6000 = 33,000,000.

(6000 -5500) / (5500 *6000) ) = 500 /33e6 = 5e2 / 3.3e7 ≈ 1.515e-5.

So,

A - B = (E2-E1)/(k) * (1.515e-5 )

But what is (E2-E1)? The energy difference can be found from the wavelength of the transition. The transition corresponds to a wavelength λ=1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

The energy E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

So,

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator:1448e-10 m =1.448e-7 m.

So,

E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Convert J to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So ΔE = E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV.

Now, k is Boltzmann's constant: 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So,

(E2-E1)/(k) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 99433 K.

So,

A - B = 99433 K * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.505.

So,

Factor = exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505 ≈ 4.5.

Wait, e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.481.

Hmm, 1.505 is close to 1.5, so exp(1.505) ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it does not, we analyze the situation using the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(E_2 > E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **When no spots are present**: The effective temperature of the star is \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\).
2. **When 40% of the surface is covered by spots**: The overall effective temperature decreases to \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
3. The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\).

### Step 1: Energy Difference Between Levels
The energy difference \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) can be calculated using the wavelength of the transition:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant, \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Substituting:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Boltzmann Factor
The ratio of \(N_1/N_2\) depends on the exponential term:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). For \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\), the exponential terms are:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = \exp\left(-\frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(6000)}\right),
\]

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) = \exp\left(-\frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(5500)}\right).
\]

Simplify the exponents:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})T}.
\]

For \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(6000)} \approx 99433 \times \frac{1}{6000} \approx 16.57.
\]

For \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(5500)} \approx 99433 \times \frac{1}{5500} \approx 18.08.
\]

Thus, the exponential terms are:

\[
\exp(-16.57) \quad \text{and} \quad \exp(-18.08).
\]

### Step 3: Ratio of Ratios
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{\exp(-16.57)}{\exp(-18.08)} = \exp(18.08 - 16.57) = \exp(1.51).
\]

Using \(\exp(1.51) \approx 4.5\), the factor is approximately **4.5**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of \(N_1/N_2\) decreases when the star has spots, and the factor by which it changes is approximately **4.5**.

**ANSWER: C**
