Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that nitriles can undergo various reactions, like hydrolysis, maybe under certain conditions. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, what's happening? Oh wait, I think that's a nucleophilic addition. In ketones, the carbonyl group is attacked by the nucleophile. NaCN would provide CN- ions, so the cyanide would add to the carbonyl carbon.

But wait, adding cyanide to a ketone. Oh yeah, that forms a cyanohydrin. The product would have an alcohol group and a nitrile, which matches the product given. So the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to a ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. 

But I also remember that in such additions, sometimes you need an acid catalyst because the carbonyl isn't very reactive on its own. So the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which helps the cyanide attack. So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ or H2SO4 or something. Looking at the options, A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 is a source of H+ but weaker, maybe?

The second reaction is a bit trickier. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to give the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. That's a hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid, right?

What conditions are needed for that? I think nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions, but for carboxylic acid formation, I believe it's typically done in an acidic environment. Wait, or is it? Let me think. Oh no, wait, hydrolysis of nitriles can be done with strong acids or strong bases. Under acidic conditions, it's usually HCl, H2SO4, heat. Alternatively, in basic conditions, it's NaOH, H2O, heat. 

Wait, but the product here is a carboxylic acid, not a salt. So the hydrolysis must be in acidic conditions because if it's basic, you'd get the acid as its conjugate base (like sodium carboxylate) and you'd need an acid work-up. But in this problem, B is H2O, so maybe the reagent doesn't include the acid yet. Hmm, no, looking at the reaction, the reagent B is the one used in addition to H2O. So, for nitrile to acid, you'd need an acid catalyst. So reagent B is probably HCl or another strong acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, when B is H2O and the reagent is one of the options, the options for B are HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, in the question, B is H2O? No, no, wait the reaction is the nitrile compound + B (H2O) → the acid. So B is the reagent, but the reaction also includes H2O as a solvent or reactant. So the reagent is something else. Wait, maybe B is the acid catalyst. So for the second step, the nitrile hydrolysis requires an acid. So if B is HCl, that would provide H+ and Cl- ions. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, which is a weaker acid, would that work?

But wait, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually needs strong acidic conditions. So HCl is a strong acid. Alternatively, H2SO4 is often used. But looking at the options, the choices are between HCl and CH3COOH.

So mapping this out: first reaction, reagent A is acid, probably H3O+ (option A or B) or NaHSO3 (option C or D). Second reaction, reagent B is HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin via addition of NaCN to ketone. The mechanism would require acid catalysis, so A is H3O+ or maybe another acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ as A, and options C and D have NaHSO3 as A. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and HSO3^- ions, but it's a weaker acid than H3O+.

So which is more appropriate? From what I remember, the formation of cyanohydrin is typically done with an acid like HCl or H3O+ to protonate the carbonyl. So A is H3O+.

For the second reaction, converting nitrile to acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is hydrolyzed to -COOH. The reaction is usually done with strong acid, like HCl in aqueous conditions, heat. So B would be HCl. So looking at the options, which option has A as H3O+ and B as HCl?

Looking at the options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl --> this fits.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, H2SO4 is used as a catalyst. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, could B be HCl? Yes.

Wait, but wait another thing. For the second reaction, the reagent is B, and the reaction uses H2O. So perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis in acidic conditions. So if B is HCl, then the reaction is done in aqueous HCl. So which option has B as HCl? Option A and option C.

Wait, option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl. So that would fit.

But wait, another point: the first reaction uses NaCN. So, when NaCN is added to a ketone under acidic conditions, the cyanide ion is the nucleophile. So the reaction is acid-catalyzed, so H3O+ is correct.

Second reaction: nitrile to acid, so the reagent B is HCl. So the correct option would be A) A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Wait, so option A is a possibility.

But wait, another approach: sometimes, when you have a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol group, as in the first product, further reactions can happen. But in this case, the second step is a hydrolysis of nitrile, so perhaps the presence of the hydroxyl group isn't interfering.

Wait, but could the first reaction be using another reagent? For instance, maybe it's not an acid? No, I don't think so. NaCN and A must be the catalyst, which is acid.

Another angle: the reaction in the first step is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which requires an acid catalyst. So A must be an acid. The options have H3O+ and NaHSO3. Which is more suitable?

In some cases, like when using aqueous ammonia, you might use H2SO4 as a catalyst. But in this case, maybe H3O+ is sufficient.

So, with that, the first part is H3O+ and the second is HCl. Looking at the options, option A says A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that's the correct option.

Wait, but looking at the options again, the B in option A is HCl. So that's right.

Alternatively, another possibility: sometimes, for the hydrolysis of nitriles to acids, you can use a mixture like H2O with an acid catalyst. So yes, B is HCl. So option A seems correct.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin through the nucleophilic addition of cyanide (from NaCN) to the carbonyl group of butan-2-one. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and facilitating the attack by the cyanide ion. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a suitable acid catalyst, as it provides the necessary protons for the reaction. Thus, reagent A is H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This transformation typically requires strong acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl is a strong acid that can provide the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group. Therefore, reagent B is HCl.

Combining these observations, the correct option is the one where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This matches option A.

Answer: A
