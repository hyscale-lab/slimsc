Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting based on the given information. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, in this question, both planets are Earth-like, so their radii are probably similar, but the stars might have different sizes.

The question says both host stars have the same radii. So the key factors here are the orbital periods and the stars' masses. Hmm, but wait, how do those affect the transit probability?

I recall that the transit probability is given by the formula (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (a / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5)), but wait, since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero. So that simplifies things. Also, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)². But wait, no, the probability is also influenced by the distance of the planet from the star. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the main factor apart from the size ratio is how likely the orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability for a circular orbit is (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_planet / a)^2)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the probability P is approximately (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_planet / a)^2)), but since the planet's size is much smaller than the star and the distance, maybe R_planet is negligible compared to a. So maybe the probability is roughly R_star/(a), but wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The transit probability can be approximated as the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but squared. Let me think. Oh, I think the probability is (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (a / (R_star * sqrt(a² - R_star²))), but that's getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler way.

Wait, I've read that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_star / a), but that's for a planet with a circular orbit and random orientation. Let me see, if the distance of the planet from the star is a, then the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)² multiplied by something else. Wait, perhaps I should recall that the transit probability P is (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a/(R_star * sqrt(a² - R_star²))). But since the planet is Earth-like, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so maybe (R_planet / R_star)² is a small factor. But since both planets have the same R_planet (they're Earth-like), that factor is the same for both, so it cancels out when comparing their probabilities. So the only thing that matters is the a and R_star.

Wait, the host stars have the same radius. So R_star1 = R_star2. So if a is the orbital distance, then the probability is proportional to 1/(a^3) or something? Wait, no, that's Kepler's third law. Wait, the orbital period is related to a via Kepler's law: P² = (4π²/G(M)) a³, where M is the star's mass.

Wait, let me get back. The transit probability is higher when the orbital distance a is smaller. Because if a is smaller, the star is larger relative to a, so the planet is more likely to pass in front. So if a planet has a smaller a, it's more likely to transit.

So, let's compute the orbital distances a for both planets.

Kepler's third law says P² = (4π² a³)/(G M). So a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

But wait, for our purposes, since we're comparing the two planets, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of a1 and a2.

Planet_1 has a period P1, and Planet_2 has P2 = 3*P1. The mass of Planet_1's host is M1 = 2 M2 (since M1 is twice that of M2). Wait, wait, the question says that the host of Planet_1 has a mass twice that of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 * M2.

So for Planet_1: a1³ = (G M1 P1²)/(4π²)
For Planet_2: a2³ = (G M2 P2²)/(4π²) = (G M2 (9 P1²))/(4π²)

So the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 P1²) / (M2 * 9 P1²) ) = (2 M2 * P1²) / (M2 * 9 P1²) ) = 2/9.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = 2/9 → (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of that is approximately 0.6. Let me calculate it more accurately. 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. Since a is smaller, the star's radius is the same for both. So the ratio of (R_star/a) is higher for a1 (since a is smaller, R/a is larger). Because the transit probability is proportional to (R_star/a), so Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the transit probability is roughly proportional to (R_star/a) * something. Now, if a1 is smaller, then (R_star/a1) would be larger. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me try to get it right. The probability of a transit is given by:

P = (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_planet / R_star)^2)) ) = (R_star / a) * sqrt(1 - (R_p / R_s)^2 )

But since R_p is much smaller than R_s, sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2, so for small x, it's approximately (R_star/a) * (1 - (R_p^2)/(2 R_s^2)).

But since both planets have the same R_p and same R_s, the term (R_p^2)/(2 R_s^2) is the same for both. So when comparing P1 and P2, the main factor is (R_s / a) * (1 - same term). So the dominant term is (R_s / a), which is the same for both planets since R_s is same. So the main comparison is the inverse ratio of a.

So, if a1 is smaller than a2, then (R_s /a1) is larger than (R_s /a2), so P1 is higher than P2.

But wait, how much higher?

Because a1 is about 0.6 a2, so a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ 0.608.

So R_s/a1 is 1/(0.608) ≈ 1.645 times larger than R_s/a2.

So P1 is approximately 1.645 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the exact ratio.

a1^3 = (M1 P1²) / (M2 P2²) * a2^3

Wait, let me compute a1/a2.

a1^3 = (M1 * (P1)^2) / (M2 * (P2)^2) ) * a2^3.

Since P2 = 3 P1, and M1 = 2 M2.

So a1^3 = (2 M2 * P1^2) / (M2 * (3 P1)^2 ) ) * a2^3

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (2 * P1^2) / (9 P1^2) ) * a2^3

= (2/9) * a2^3.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3). Let's compute:

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222:

We know that 0.6^3 = 0.216, 0.608^3 ≈ (0.6)^3 + 3*(0.6)^2*(0.008) + ... ≈ 0.216 + 3*(0.36)(0.008) = 0.216 + 0.00864 = ~0.22464. Hmm, but 0.6^3 is 0.216, 0.608^3 is approximately 0.22464. So 0.2222 is between 0.6 and 0.608.

Let me compute (0.608)^3: 0.608 * 0.608 = 0.369664; 0.369664 * 0.608 ≈ 0.2246.

But 2/9 is approximately 0.2222, which is a bit less than 0.2246. So (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.605.

So a1/a2 ≈ 0.605 → a1 = 0.605 a2.

So R_s/a1 is 1/(0.605) ≈ 1.6529 times R_s/a2.

So the transit probability P is proportional to (R_s/a) → so P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

Wait, but let me double-check the math. Because the transit probability isn't just (R_s/a), but it's (R_s/a) multiplied by another term.

Wait, another way: the transit probability for a given planet is given by:

P = (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_planet / R_star)^2)).

But since R_planet is the same for both and R_star is the same, the sqrt term is the same for both. So the main factor is (R_star / a), so the ratio P1/P2 is (a2)/(a1).

Because P1 = (R/a1) * const, P2 = (R/a2) * const.

So P1/P2 = a2/a1.

Because a1 is smaller than a2, a2/a1 is larger than 1.

Wait, wait, let me clarify.

If a1 < a2, then (R/a1) > (R/a2).

So P1 = (R/a1) * const.

P2 = (R/a2) * const.

Thus, P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

We have a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.605.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.605 ≈ 1.652.

So P1 is about 1.65 times more probable than P2.

So Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher probability to transit than Planet_2.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability. That matches.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is much higher. So not that.

Option A and B are about Planet_2 being preferred, which would be the case if a2 was smaller, but a2 is larger, so P2 is lower.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given information:

1. **Transit Probability Formula**: The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital distance of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the key factor is the ratio of the orbital distances \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \).

2. **Kepler's Third Law**: The orbital distance \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M \) by:
   \[
   a^3 \propto M \cdot P^2
   \]
   For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
   - \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
   - \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

   Substituting these values:
   \[
   \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}P_2\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
   \]
   Taking the cube root:
   \[
   \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
   \]
   Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbital distance is smaller than Planet_2's.

3. **Transit Probability Ratio**: Since the transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), the ratio of the probabilities \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) is:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65
   \]
   Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

4. **Conclusion**: Planet_1 is preferred for observation due to its higher transit probability.

**Option Analysis**:
- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and its transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher.
- **D)** Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 2.7.
