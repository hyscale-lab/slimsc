Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and starspots. Hmm, I remember that starspots can make a star appear dimmer when they rotate into view, which can sometimes be mistaken for a planet transiting the star. The question is asking about the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

Let me read the details again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Only one hemisphere is spotty, so when it rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness changes.

Wait, but the question is about what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star. So without the spots, what planet would give the same dip in brightness.

I think the key here is to calculate the change in brightness (the dip) caused by the spots and then compare that to the dip caused by a planet transit.

First, let's think about the star's brightness. The total luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. Since the star's radius is same as the Sun's, Rstar = R_sun.

Now, the spots: They cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²/2) )? Wait, no. Wait, the entire surface is 4πR². So one hemisphere is 2πR². Spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

Each spot has a temperature of 6000K - 1000K = 5000K? Or is it 6000K minus 1000K, so the spot temp is 5000K? So the spots are cooler.

The star's total brightness without spots would be L_total = 4πR² σ (6000)^4. But with spots, the brightness is a bit less when the spots are facing us.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the spot area is facing us, the star's light is dimmer. The variation in brightness (delta L) would be the difference between the normal brightness and when the spots are visible.

But wait, the variation in brightness when the spots rotate into view is a dip. The amplitude of that dip depends on how much less light the spots emit compared to the rest of the star.

So the unspotted part of the star is at 6000K. The spots are at 5000K. So each spot emits less flux.

The flux from a spot is sigma * T_spot^4. The flux from the surrounding area is sigma * T_star^4.

So for each spot, the change in flux is (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) * area of the spot.

Wait, but since the spots are cooler, the flux from them is less, so when a spot comes into view, the total flux decreases.

But how much does it decrease? Let's model it.

The area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). So for one hemisphere, which is 2πR², 20% is 0.4πR². So the area blocked is 0.4π R².

But wait, does the spot get completely blocked (i.e., emits zero flux) or does it emit less? Oh, in reality, the spots emit less flux, so the change is the difference between the original flux and the spot's flux.

The total flux from the star without spots is F0 = sigma * T_star^4 * (4π R²) / (4π) )? Wait, no, the flux per unit area is sigma * T^4, so the total flux is sigma T^4 * 4π R² / (4π) )? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the flux from the star is F = sigma T^4 * (Area) / (4π), but wait, the star's total flux is L = 4π R² sigma T^4, so the flux we receive (from a distance) is L/(4π d²) = R² sigma T^4 / d². But since we're comparing relative changes, maybe the distance will cancel out.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the relative change in brightness when the spots are visible.

The star's normal flux is F_normal = sigma * T_star^4 * (Area of star) / (4π). But wait, the star emits a total flux F = sigma T^4 * 4π R² / (4π) )= sigma T^4 R². Wait, I'm not too clear on that, perhaps it's better to model the flux as the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions.

Alternatively, think in terms of the fraction of the star's area that is spots and the corresponding flux.

So the flux from the star when no spots are visible is F0 = sigma T_star^4 * A_star / (4π), where A_star is the area of the star, 4π R². Wait, but when considering the star as seen from Earth, the flux is the sum of all the surface elements. Each surface element emits flux according to its temperature.

So when part of the star is covered by spots, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the non-spotted area and the spotted area.

The non-spotted area is (1 - 0.2) * (hemisphere area) * 2? Wait, no. Because the spot is only on one hemisphere. So the star is a sphere, one hemisphere is 2π R². So the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

The non-spotted area (on that hemisphere) is 2π R² - 0.4π R² = 1.6 π R². The other hemisphere is entirely unspotted, 2π R².

So the total non-spotted area is 2π R² (other hemisphere) + 1.6π R² (unspotted part of the first hemisphere) = 3.6 π R².

Wait, but that's the area. So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is F = (3.6 π R² * sigma T_star^4) + (0.4 π R² * sigma T_spot^4) ) / (4 π R²) ?

Wait, no. The total flux is (sum of each area's contribution) / (4π) because the area is the surface area of the sphere, and the flux at a distance is each point's flux summed.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the fractional change in brightness.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma T^4 * 4 π R² / (4 π) )? That can't be right. Wait, no, the star's total luminosity is L = 4 π R² sigma Teff^4. So the flux received at Earth (assuming Earth is at distance d) is L/(4π d²) = (4 π R² sigma T^4) / (4 π d²) ) = (R² sigma T^4) / d².

But when part of the star is covered by cooler spots, the total flux is reduced by the area of the spots times the difference in their flux.

The fractional change in flux (delta F / F0) would be (delta F) = (Area_spots * (sigma T_spot^4 - sigma T_star^4)) ) / (4 pi R² sigma T_star^4) )

Because the total flux is F0 = sigma T_star^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi) )? Wait, no. Wait, the star's surface emits sigma T^4 per unit area. So each square meter emits sigma T^4. So the total flux is (4 pi R^2) * sigma T^4 / (4 pi d^2) ), which simplifies to (R^2 sigma T^4) / (d^2).

So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = [ (4 pi R^2 - Area_spots) * sigma T_star^4 + Area_spots * sigma T_spot^4 ] / (4 pi d^2 )

So the fractional change is (F - F0) / F0.

Which would be [ ( (4 pi R² - A) sigma T_star^4 + A sigma T_spot^4 ) - (4 pi R² sigma T_star^4 ) ] / (4 pi R² sigma T_star^4 )

Simplify numerator: (4 pi R² sigma T^4 - A sigma T^4 + A sigma T_spot^4 ) - 4 pi R² sigma T^4 = - A sigma T^4 (1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4 )) )

Denominator: 4 pi R² sigma T^4.

So delta F / F0 = [ - A sigma T^4 (1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4 )) ) ] / [4 pi R^2 sigma T^4 ]

The sigma and T^4 terms cancel out.

= [ - A (1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4 )) ] / (4 pi R^2 )

= [ - A ( (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ) ] / (4 pi R^2 T^4 )

But A is the area of the spots. A = 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

So substituting A:

delta F / F0 = [ - 0.4 pi R² (T^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 pi R² T^4 )

Simplify: 0.4 pi R² cancels with 4 pi R² in denominator.

So = [ - 0.4 (T^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 T^4 )

= [ -0.4 (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 T^4 )

= [ -0.1 (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / T^4

= -0.1 (1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4 )) 

So the fractional change is -0.1 (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Calculating (5000/6000)^4: 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. 0.8333^4 ≈ (approx) 0.8333^2 = 0.6944, then squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.05177.

So fractional change is approximately -0.05177, or a 5.177% dip.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the star's brightness variation due to the spots will have an amplitude corresponding to a planet transit. So the dip in brightness when the spots are visible would be the same as the dip caused by a planet.

The dip caused by a planet is when the planet transits in front of the star, blocking some of the light. The depth of that dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is a black disk and the star is uniform.

So the amplitude of the light curve (the dip) caused by the planet is (R_p / R_s)^2.

We need this to be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which is approximately 0.05177 (5.177%).

So set (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.05177.

Take square root: R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, so about 0.228.

Wait wait, but that would give a radius of about 0.228 R_s. But looking at the options, the closest is option D: ~0.32, but that's higher. Hmm, wait, did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, let's double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate (5000/6000)^4:

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(5/6)^2 = (25/36) ≈ 0.694444.

(5/6)^4 ≈ (25/36)^2 ≈ 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517747.

So the fractional dip is 0.05177, about 5.177%.

So (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.05177.

Take square root: sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, so R_p is about 22.75% of R_s. But looking at the options, the closest is option D: ~0.32 (32% R_s), or option C: ~0.11 (11% R_s). Hmm, but 0.2275 is between 0.11 and 0.32, but closer to 0.23.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match that. Wait, looking at the options again:

Options:
A) ~0.39
B) ~0.07
C) ~0.11
D) ~0.32

Hmm, so 0.2275 is closest to option C, 0.11? No, 0.22 is closer to 0.23, which isn't listed. Wait, did I miscalculate the fractional dip?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area. Let me re-examine.

The problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area covered is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere).

Hemisphere area is 2 pi R². So 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

So earlier calculation was correct.

Wait, but perhaps the star is only showing one hemisphere to us because of its rotation. So when the spots are on the approaching side, and then when they rotate away, etc. But the maximum dip occurs when the maximum area of spots is in front of us.

Wait, but in the calculation of the dip, when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 pi R² is in front. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2. Because when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light proportional to (R_p + R_s)^2 - R_s^2, but actually, the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2 assuming R_p << R_s. So that part is correct.

Hmm. So according to this, the planet's radius should be about 0.227 R_s. But none of the options are close to that. Wait, perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the brightness variation is not just the dip when the spots are visible but due to both the increase and decrease as the spots rotate into and out of view. But the amplitude is the maximum dip, which is what I calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional dip. Let me recompute the fractional dip.

So, (T_spot / T_star) = 5000/6000 = 5/6.

(T_spot^4 ) = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 )) = 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1 (from the 0.4 pi R² being 0.4/(4 pi R²) * pi R²? Wait, perhaps another mistake here.

Wait, earlier steps:

delta F / F0 = [ - A ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 pi R^2 T^4 )

Wait, A is 0.4 pi R².

So substituting, it's:

delta F / F0 = [ - 0.4 pi R² ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 pi R² T^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator: 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

So delta F / F0 = -0.1 ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) / T^4 = -0.1 (1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4 )).

Which is correct.

So that's 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) ) = 0.051775.

So the dip is about 5.18%.

So the planet's dip would need to be the same, 5.18%. So (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.051775.

So R_p = sqrt(0.051775) * R_s.

Hmm, 0.051775 is approximately 5.18%.

sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275. So 0.2275 R_s, which is about 22.75% of the star's radius.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is C) ~0.11, which is 11%, or D) ~0.32, which is 32%.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me think again.

Wait, when the star is not covered by spots, what would the planet's radius be to cause a 5.18% dip?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think of it differently.

The observed brightness variation is due to the spots. The amplitude is the maximum dip, which is 5.18%. So the planet would need to cause the same dip, so the planet's radius is sqrt(0.0518) * R_s ≈ 0.2275 R_s.

But looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Another possible approach: perhaps the star's brightness variation is not the dip but the variation as the spots rotate. So it's the change in brightness over time, not the maximum dip.

Wait, but the question says the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same. So the amplitude is the maximum dip, which is 5.18%.

So either I'm making a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is periodic because the spots are on a hemisphere, so when the star rotates, more or less spots come into view.

Wait, no. The maximum dip is when the maximum area of spots is blocking the star's light.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation isn't just a dip but also a rise when the spots come into view, but I don't think that's the case because the spots are cooler, so when they come into view, the brightness decreases. But when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is normal.

Wait, perhaps I confused the fractional dip with the planet's transit dip. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the area of the spots.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the spot's filling factor is 20% of the total star's surface, not the hemisphere. But the question says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

Hmm. So I think the calculation is correct. Then perhaps the answer isn't among the options. But wait, looking again, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm. 0.2275 is close to 0.23, which isn't an option. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the temperature difference, but the area is a factor of 0.2 over the entire star. But no, the question says one hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the fractional dip more precisely.

Let me compute (5000/6000)^4 more accurately.

5/6 = 0.8333333333.

(0.8333333333)^4 = ?

Let me compute:

(0.8333333333)^2 = 0.6944444444.

(0.6944444444)^2 = approximately 0.4822530864.

So 1 - 0.4822530864 = 0.5177469136.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.05177469136.

So the dip is approximately 5.1775%.

So (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.05177469136.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.05177469136) = approximately 0.227535.

So 0.2275 * R_s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of two somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the star emits from both hemispheres, but when one hemisphere is spotty, the other isn't. So the average brightness is slightly less than when the spotty hemisphere is not visible.

Wait, but the problem is about the maximum dip. And the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is the difference between when the spotty hemisphere is facing us and when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, that could change things. Oh, right, because when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower, and when the non-spotty is facing, it's higher.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The star's brightness is the sum of all the surface areas. So when the spotty hemisphere is on our side, the brightness is lower than when it's the non-spotty hemisphere. But the star is rotating, so the brightness varies as the spots come into view.

Wait, but for the purpose of the light curve amplitude, perhaps the variation is from when maximum spots are visible to when none are. So the amplitude is twice the dip I calculated earlier.

Wait, no. Let me think. The average brightness without any spots is F0. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is F0 - delta F. When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is F0 (since all the spots are on the far side). So the variation is from F0 to F0 - delta F, so the amplitude is delta F.

Wait, but that's not correct. The star's brightness is the sum of all the areas. So when the star is viewed such that a portion of the spotty hemisphere is visible, the brightness would be lower. The maximum dip occurs when the entire spotty hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum dip is the same as when the spotty area is fully in front.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum brightness occurs when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, but that's not correct because the other hemisphere also has spots. Wait, no: the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So the other hemisphere is spot-free. So the maximum brightness occurs when the spot-free hemisphere is facing us. Wait, but when the star is viewed from the side, the hemisphere with spots would be half visible. Hmm, perhaps this complicates the calculation.

Wait, this might be the mistake. Let me reevaluate.

The star has one hemisphere with spots (20% filled) and the other hemisphere without spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The maximum dip in brightness would occur when the spotty hemisphere is directly facing us, and the spot-free hemisphere is on the back side.

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4 pi R². The spotted area is 0.4 pi R². The non-spotted area is 4 pi R² - 0.4 pi R² = 3.6 pi R².

Wait, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area visible is 2 pi R², of which 0.4 pi R² is spots and 1.6 pi R² is non-spots. The other hemisphere is not visible.

Wait, no, the visible area when the star is viewed face-on is 2 pi R² (the front hemisphere), and the back is hidden. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 0.4 pi R² spots and 1.6 pi R² non-spots. The other hemisphere isn't visible.

When the star rotates 180 degrees, the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, so the visible area is 2 pi R², all non-spots. So the brightness in this case is higher.

So the brightness variation would be from when the spotty hemisphere is facing us (lower brightness) to when the non-spotty is (higher brightness). But the amplitude of the light curve is the difference between maximum and minimum brightness. So amplitude is (F_high - F_low) / 2.

Wait, no. The amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation, which would be (F_high - F_low). But sometimes it's considered as the semi-amplitude, which is (F_high - F_low)/2.

In transit photometry, the amplitude is usually the depth of the dip, which is F0 - F_dip. So perhaps the problem refers to the dip amplitude.

But let me reevaluate the brightness in both cases.

Case 1: Spotty hemisphere facing us. The visible area is 2 pi R², of which 0.4 pi R² is spots (T=5000K) and 1.6 pi R² is non-spots (T=6000K).

Case 2: Non-spotty hemisphere facing us. The visible area is 2 pi R², all non-spots (T=6000K).

So compute F_high and F_low.

Compute F_high: when non-spotty hemisphere is facing.

F_high = (2 pi R² * sigma T^4 ) / (4 pi d² )

F_high = (2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 ) / (4 pi d^2 )

Simplify: (2 R² sigma (6000^4) ) / (4 d² )

= (R² sigma (6000^4) ) / (2 d² )

F_low: when spotty hemisphere is facing.

F_low = (1.6 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4 ) / (4 pi d² )

= [ (1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 * 5000^4 ) * sigma R² ] / (4 d² )

So compute the numerator:

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 6.25e15.

1.6 * 1.296e16 = 2.0736e16.

0.4 * 6.25e15 = 2.5e15.

Sum: 2.0736e16 + 2.5e15 = 2.3236e16.

So F_low = (2.3236e16 sigma R² ) / (4 d² )

F_high = (1.296e16 sigma R² ) / (2 d² )

Wait, let me compute F_high and F_low in terms of F0.

F0 is the brightness when no spots are present. Wait, no, F0 isn't exactly that because the star has spots. Wait, no, F0 is the brightness when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, which is the maximum brightness. Because when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower. So F_high is F0, and F_low is when the spots are visible.

Wait, but no, in reality, F_high is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, which is a brighter state. So the maximum brightness is F_high, and the minimum is F_low.

So the amplitude of the light curve is F_high - F_low.

Compute F_high:

F_high = (2 pi R² sigma T^4 ) / (4 pi d² ) = (2 R² sigma T^4 ) / (4 d² ) = (R² sigma T^4 )/(2 d² )

F_low = [ (1.6 * T^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4 ) * pi R² sigma ] / (4 pi d² )

= [ (1.6 T^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) R² sigma ] / (4 d² )

= [ (1.6 T^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) R² sigma ] / (4 d² )

So F_high = [ T^4 R² sigma ]/(2 d² )

= [2 T^4 R² sigma ]/(4 d² )

So F_high - F_low = [2 T^4 - (1.6 T^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) ] R² sigma / (4 d² )

= [ (2 T^4 -1.6 T^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 ) ] R² sigma / (4 d² )

= [0.4 T^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 ] R² sigma / (4 d² )

= 0.4 ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) R² sigma / (4 d² )

= ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) R² sigma (0.4) / (4 d² )

= ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) R² sigma (0.1) / (d² )

But F_high = ( R² sigma T^4 )/(2 d² )

So the amplitude (F_high - F_low) is 0.1 ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) R² sigma / d².

So the relative amplitude is (F_high - F_low)/F_high.

= [ 0.1 ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) R² sigma / d² ) ] / [ ( R² sigma T^4 )/(2 d² ) ]

= [ 0.1 ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [ ( T^4 ) / 2 ]

= 0.2 ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) / T^4

= 0.2 ( 1 - ( T_spot^4 / T^4 ) )

As before, T_spot =5000, T=6000.

So (T_spot / T )^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.10355.

So relative amplitude is 0.10355, about 10.36% variation.

Wait, that's different from the previous calculation. Earlier I thought the dip was about 5.17%, but this way it's about 10.36% variation.

Wait, that's a big difference. So which approach is correct?

Hmm. The relative amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation divided by the mean brightness.

In the first approach, I considered the dip as a 5.17% decrease from F0. But in this approach, the amplitude is about 10.35% of F_high.

So the peak-to-peak variation is about 10.35% of F_high. But in the planet transit scenario, the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2, which is a fractional dip. So the amplitude as a dip would be (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.05177, as before. But the peak-to-peak variation is 2 * (R_p/R_s)^2 if the star returns to normal brightness after the planet transits.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.

The question states that the brightness variations due to the spots will have the same amplitude as a planet transit. So the amplitude refers to the depth of the dip, not the peak-to-peak variation.

Because in the case of a planet transit, the light curve's amplitude is the depth of the dip, not the change from maximum to minimum. So if the dip is 5%, that's the amplitude.

But in the earlier approach, considering the relative amplitude as (F_high - F_low)/F_high gives a peak-to-peak of about 10%, but the dip is 5%.

Hmm. So which approach is correct for the problem?

The problem says, "the amplitude of the brightness variation." In photometric terms, the amplitude is the depth of the dip, not the peak-to-peak. So the earlier calculation where the dip is ~5.18% is correct.

So the planet's dip should be approximately 5.18%, leading to R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, perhaps the area of the spots is 20% of the whole star? No, the problem says 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation isn't considering that when the star is viewed edge-on, only a portion of the spots is visible, leading to a smaller dip. But when the star is viewed face-on, all spots are visible.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness variation is due to rotational modulation. So the star is rotating, and the observer sees the spots rotate into and out of view, leading to a periodic change in brightness.

So the maximum dip is when the maximum area of spots is visible, which, for a star viewed face-on, is when the entire spotty hemisphere is visible, which is 0.4 pi R².

Wait, but if the star is viewed edge-on, the visible area is a circle with radius R, so the area is pi R². So the maximum area of spots visible would be the area of the spots that's in the visible hemisphere.

But the problem doesn't specify the viewing angle, so perhaps it's assumed to be viewed face-on, leading to maximum dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average effect over rotation, but that's unclear.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of the options again.

The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

If the correct R_p/R_s is approximately 0.2275, which is about 0.23, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I need to reevaluate the initial calculation.

Alternative approach: perhaps the star's brightness variation due to the spots is modelled as the same as the planet's transit. So the area blocked by the planet is R_p^2, and the area blocked by the spots is the fractional area times the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps another way to compute the brightness variation is to model the spots as a darkening on the star's surface. So the observed flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions.

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F = (1 - f) F_unspotted + f F_spotted.

Where f is the filling factor (20% = 0.2), and F_unspotted is the flux per unit area of the star's surface, F_spotted is the flux per unit area of the spots.

F_unspotted = sigma T^4.

F_spotted = sigma (T - delta T)^4 = sigma (5000)^4.

So the total flux is F = (1 - 0
