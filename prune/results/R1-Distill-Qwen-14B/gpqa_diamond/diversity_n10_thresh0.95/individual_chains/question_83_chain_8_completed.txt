Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a neutralization reaction. 

The problem says we start by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Wait, so first, I should figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. When you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? Because concentration is moles per volume, so if you double the volume, the concentration halves. So the original solution is 0.05 M acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration is 0.025 M. That makes sense.

Next, when titrating, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The moles of each will determine the equivalence point.

Wait, but the question mentions 25% titration and the equivalence point. So let me calculate the equivalence point first.

The initial moles of acetic acid: volume is 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters), concentration 0.05 M. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, wait. No, wait: wait, wait, the initial solution is 0.05 M in 20 cm³. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

When you add 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M as I thought.

For the equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed would be equal to moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So at equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to form acetate ions. The solution will be of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point: How much solution is present? We have the initial 40 cm³ (from 20+20), plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH added. So total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But wait, wait! Wait, at equivalence point, the solution is a buffer of acetate ions in water. The pH can be calculated using the Kb of acetate. Because CH3COO⁻ is the conjugate base of CH3COOH.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The pH at equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

The Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So using the approximation for weak base:

[OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) 

Let me compute that. 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root of that is sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.57? Wait, wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 1.081e-11 is 1.081 x 10^-11. Square root is sqrt(1.081)=1.04, and sqrt(10^-11)=10^-5.5. So 1.04e-5.5 → wait, 10^-5.5 is about 3.16e-6, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, 10^-5 is 1e-5, 10^-6 is 1e-6. 10^(-5.5) is 3.16e-6. So 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.29e-6.

So [OH-] = 3.29e-6 M. Then pOH is -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.48. So pH is 14 -5.48 = 8.52. Hmm, wait, but wait, looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second pH value. Option D has 6.92 as the second. Hmm, but I thought the equivalence point would be higher than 7, which is basic. So 8.52 sounds about right.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. The square root is sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081)*sqrt(1e-11) → sqrt(1.081)≈1.04, sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5=approximately 3.16e-6. So 1.04 *3.16e-6 ≈3.29e-6. So yes, [OH-] is 3.29e-6, which gives pOH of 5.48. pH is 8.52.

So equivalence pH is about 8.52. So looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value, and option D has 6.92 as the second (that's lower than 7, which would be acidic, which can't be right because equivalence point is basic). So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the concentration at equivalence point. Let me check.

At equivalence point, we have 0.001 mol of acetate in 0.05 L (50 cm³). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That part is correct.

Wait, maybe the Kb is miscalculated. Let me compute it again. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14/(1.85e-5) = (1 /1.85) * 1e-9 * 1e-14 /1e-5? Wait, no, 1e-14 /1.85e-5 is (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Right, that was correct.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the exact solution for Kb. The Kb is 5.405e-10, and the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So the hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO⁻] 

Assume x is [OH-], then:

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 -x) ≈ x² /0.02 → x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.5? Wait, but 1.04e-5.5 is 1.04 * 1e-5.5 → 1e-5 is 1e-5, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 5.5 is between. 1e-5.5 is approximately 3.16e-6.

So x ≈ 3.29e-6, as before. So pOH is log(3.29e-6) = log(3.29) + log(1e-6) → 0.517 + (-6) → pOH is 5.483. So pH=14-5.483=8.517, so approximately 8.52. So that's correct.

So equivalence point pH is about 8.52, which matches option A's second number, but let's look at the options.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D: 4.57; 6.92

Wait, but wait, when I started the problem, I thought I was looking for pH at 25% titration and equivalence. So the first value is the pH at 25% titration.

So what's the pH at 25% titration?

At 25% titration, how much NaOH has been added?

We have 0.001 mol of acetic acid. 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.00025 /0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

So the total solution volume at 25% titration is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ =0.0425 L.

Now, let's find the concentrations.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The reaction is 1:1, so moles of acid reacted = moles of NaOH added =0.00025 mol.

So remaining moles of acetic acid: initial 0.001 mol - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

So the concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's compute that: 0.00075 / 0.0425. 0.00075 is 7.5e-4. 7.5e-4 / 0.0425 → same as 7.5e-4 /4.25e-2 → 7.5/(4.25) * 1e-2 → 7.5/4.25 is approximately 1.7647 → 1.7647e-2 → 0.01765 M.

[CH3COO⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So this is a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(Ka) → Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.738.

So pH = 4.738 + log(0.005882 / 0.01765)

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.01765 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is approx -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.738 - 0.477 → 4.261. So around 4.26. That matches option A's first number.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the initial moles after adding 20 cm³ of water are 0.001 mol in 0.04 L, so 0.025 M.

At 25% titration, 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol NaOH added.

So the solution has:

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = (0.00075) / 0.0425 → 0.00075 is 7.5e-4. 7.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = (7.5 /4.25) * 1e-2 → 1.7647 * 0.01=0.017647 M.

[ A- ] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 → 0.005882 M.

Ratio is [A-]/[HA] = 0.005882 /0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

So pH= pKa + log(0.333) → pKa is about 4.738. log(0.333) is -0.477. So 4.738 -0.477 ≈4.26. So that's correct.

So the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and at equivalence point, 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D has 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the pH at 25% titration. Let me think again.

Wait, another way to approach the 25% titration:

Since 25% of the acid has been neutralized, the ratio is acetate to acid is 1:3. Because 0.00025 mol (acetate) and 0.00075 mol (acid). So the ratio is 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3. So in Henderson equation, that's log(1/3) = -0.477, so pH = pKa -0.477 → 4.738-0.477=4.261. So yes, same as before.

So the first part is pH 4.26, second part 8.52. Which is option A.

Wait, but wait, another thought: when you dilute the acetic acid, the initial concentration is 0.025 M. So when you add NaOH, the solution becomes a buffer. But in the second part, the equivalence point, the acetate is 0.02 M. So perhaps the calculations are correct.

So why is option D an option? Let me look at option D: 4.57; 6.92. Hmm, 6.92 is lower than 7, which would be acidic. That can't be correct at equivalence point because equivalence point for a weak acid and strong base should be above 7.

So option A is the only one with 8.52 as the second pH value. So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid with NaOH, focusing on the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Initial Setup and Dilution
- **Initial moles of acetic acid**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- After diluting with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The new concentration is:  
  \[
  \text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 2: Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to form acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻). The solution contains 0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻ in a total volume of 50 cm³ (40 cm³ original solution + 10 cm³ NaOH added). The concentration of acetate is:  
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]
The equilibrium constant \(K_b\) is calculated as:  
\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]
Using the approximation for weak bases:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.02)} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5}.
\]
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] \approx -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 5.48.
\]
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} \approx 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Step 3: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The moles of NaOH added are:  
\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]
This reacts with 0.00025 mol of CH₃COOH, leaving:  
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]
The moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed are:  
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]
The total volume is now:  
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentrations are:  
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]
where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.738 \). Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{pH} = 4.738 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.01765}\right) \approx 4.738 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.738 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
