Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. The setup is a bit tricky, but I'll try to visualize it.

So, the conductor is spherical with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r, and the center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Because r is less than R, the cavity is entirely within the conductor. Now, they place a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, which is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. But wait, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Oh right, in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. But wait, this is a conductor with a cavity. So I think the cavity is non-conductive, maybe? Or perhaps it's a hollow part with no charge initially.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged. So when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So the inner surface of the conductor would have a charge -q. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, that -q must be balanced by a +q on the outer surface.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the conductor as a whole was initially uncharged. So when you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge -q. Because the conductor itself must remain neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge +q. Right, because the total charge on the conductor is zero. So inner surface has -q, outer surface +q.

Wait no, wait. Oh, wait, the conductor was uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. So when the +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have a charge -q (induced by the +q). Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance it, so that the total is zero. So the conductor's net charge is zero.

But the point P is outside the conductor, so I need to find the electric field there. I think that when you're outside a conductor, the electric field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for a spherical conductor, the external electric field is the same as that due to a point charge located at the center.

But wait, in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field outside the conductor should be due to that +q. Because all the charges are on the surface and they distribute themselves spherically symmetrically. So regardless of where the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface of the conductor will have +q, and the inner surface -q.

Wait, but the point P is outside, so the field there depends only on the outer surface charge, which is +q. So the electric field at P would be the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So using Coulomb's law, the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). Because the conductor's outer surface has +q.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). But let me think again. Are there any other factors here? The position of the charge inside the cavity, does that affect the outer field? Oh, right, no. Because the charges on the inner and outer surfaces are induced in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero, and the field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed, which is +q.

Wait, but in this problem, the conductor's own induced charges would be such that the net charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, making the conductor's total charge zero. So when you're outside the conductor, the field is as if the +q is at the center. So the field at P depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor (L) and the charge q.

But wait, the problem states that the point P is at a distance l from the center of the cavity, and the angle between l and s is theta. Is that relevant? Because in the conductor's frame, the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center, regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed.

Wait, but in this setup, because the cavity's center is shifted by s from the conductor's center, placing the charge q inside the cavity might change the distribution. But wait, the conductor being a conductor, the charges on the inner surface will adjust to ensure that the conductor's interior (the material of the conductor) is field-free. So the inner surface's charge distribution will ensure that inside the conductor, the field is zero. But the outer surface's charge distribution is spherically symmetric because the conductor is a sphere. So the position of the charge inside the cavity (at a point the user chooses) doesn't affect the outer field because the outer charge is symmetric.

Wait, but in this problem, the conductor is a sphere, so even if the inner charge is shifted, the outer surface remains symmetric. So the field outside the conductor (at P) would be as if the +q is at the center of the conductor.

But wait, let's think about it more carefully. Suppose the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the cavity is not concentric. Then, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q because the charge inside the cavity is +q. But because the cavity is not concentric, the inner surface's charge distribution is not uniform. It would be such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But the outer surface, being a sphere, would have a uniform distribution because the conductor is spherical, regardless of where the inner charge is located.

Wait, but if the conductor is a sphere, then the outer surface must have a spherically symmetric charge distribution, regardless of the inner charge's position. So the field outside the conductor is the same as if all the charge were located at the center of the conductor.

So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Which is option B.

Wait, but the options have a choice with l and theta. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the situation is such that the field inside the conductor is zero, but the point P is outside. Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the correct reference point.

Wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but l is the distance from the center of the cavity. So the displacement from the conductor's center to the cavity's center is s. So the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, which is along a line that makes an angle theta with the s vector. So perhaps the point P is not along the same line as the conductor's center and the cavity's center. But since the outer charge is symmetrically distributed, the field at P would still only depend on L, the distance from the conductor's center, not on l or theta.

So the correct answer should be option B: (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Let me quickly check the other options. Option A uses (l - s cosθ)^2, which seems like the distance squared in a shifted scenario, perhaps considering the position of the charge inside the cavity. But since the outer field is based on the outer charge, which is spherically symmetric, this would not apply. Option C uses l + s cosθ, which might be considering vector addition but I don't think that's relevant. Option D uses l squared, but if the field depends on L, then D would only be correct if l and L are the same, which they are not necessarily.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$. It is given that $l, L > R$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain overall charge neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and the distance from the center of the conductor. This is a result of the spherical symmetry of the conductor, which ensures that the charge distribution on the outer surface is uniform.

3. **Relevance of $l$ and $\theta$**: The distance $l$ and the angle $\theta$ describe the position of point $P$ relative to the cavity's center. However, since the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, these parameters do not affect the field at $P$.

4. **Electric Field at $P$**: Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This matches the form of option **B**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which appears to consider the position of the charge inside the cavity. However, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the outer surface charge and $L$, not on $l$ or $\theta$.
- **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, which depends only on $L$ and $q$.
- **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is irrelevant for the same reason as option A.
- **Option D**: Uses $l^2$ instead of $L^2$. While $l$ is the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center, the field outside the conductor depends on $L$, the distance to the conductor's center.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**, as the electric field at $P$ depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.
