Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—maybe it's all about electric potential energy.

So the setup is a bit specific. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So I imagine point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm. Wait, what kind of energy? Since all the charges are fixed except the 13th, but the 12 are constrained at 2m, I think we're dealing with electric potential energy.

But wait, the system is isolated, so maybe it's about the potential energy of the configuration of these charges. The minimum energy—so I guess that refers to the potential energy when the system is arranged in the most stable way possible, which might be the configuration with the lowest potential energy. But since the charges are fixed except for the one at P, perhaps the minimum is when like charges are as close as possible or as far as possible? Hmm.

But wait, all the charges except the 13th are at 2m from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th has a charge of 2e, and the others are each 2e as well. So all are positive, I assume, since each is 2e. So positive charges repel each other. So the more they spread out, the higher the potential energy. Wait, no, actually, when like charges are closer together, the potential energy is higher because you have to do work against their repulsion. So the system's potential energy is higher when the charges are closer. So to minimize the energy, perhaps you want to arrange them as far apart as possible? But in this problem, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed at 2m from P. So the only thing that can move is the 13th charge, but wait, it's fixed at P. Oh, wait, no—no, all the 12 are at 2m from P. So the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are each 2m away from P. So their positions are fixed relative to P.

Wait, but the system is isolated. So perhaps the charges are not moving relative to each other because they are constrained. So the configuration is fixed. So the potential energy is a fixed value, and the question is asking for that value.

So the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But since the system is isolated, I think we're considering the electric potential energy stored in the configuration.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is a distance r = 2m from the charge at P. So the potential energy between each of those 12 and the 13th charge would be U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since q1 is 2e and q2 is 2e, each pair would have U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

But wait, there are 12 such pairs (each of the 12 charges at 2m from P interacting with the 13th at P). So total U from these interactions is 12 * [k*(2e)^2 / (2m)].

Wait, but also, the 12 charges at 2m from P are each at the same distance from each other? Or are they arranged in some way? Hmm, the problem says they are at 2m from point P, but how are they arranged around P? Like, are they all at the same point? That can't be, because then the potential energy would be very high. But perhaps they are arranged in a way where they are as far apart as possible, given the constraint of being 2m from P. Maybe in a sphere? So each of the 12 is on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, centered at P.

But wait, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges also contributes to the total potential energy. So in addition to the interactions between each of the 12 and the 13th, I also have to consider the potential energy between each pair among the 12.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps I'm supposed to arrange the 12 charges in a way that the total potential energy is minimized, given that they are all at 2m from P. Because if the 12 are arranged as far apart as possible, that would minimize the potential energy between them, as each pair would be as far apart as possible. But wait, potential energy for like charges is positive and increases as they get closer. So if the 12 charges are arranged as far apart as possible, the potential energy between each other would be minimized (as low as possible, but it's a positive value). Alternatively, if they are brought closer together, the potential energy increases.

Wait, but in this problem, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their distance from P is fixed. But their distance from each other could vary. So to minimize the total potential energy of the system, you'd want to arrange them such that the potential energy between each pair is minimized, which would be when they are as far apart as possible.

Wait, but how would that arrangement look? If all 12 are on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m, then the maximum distance between any two would be 4m (diametrically opposite). But arranging them so that all pairs are as far apart as possible is a complicated problem, probably the case where they form a regular icosahedron or something. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps the potential energy between the 12 charges can be approximated, or maybe the problem ignores it, considering only the energy between the 13th charge and the others. Hmm.

Let me read the problem again. It says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So their positions are fixed on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m. So the distance between any two of them could vary, but perhaps in the problem, their arrangement is such that their mutual potential energy is zero? Or maybe the problem is designed to consider only the energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not the energy among the 12 themselves. Because the problem is asking for the minimum energy, and perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which would minimize the total.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Like charges cannot have zero potential energy among themselves. Because if they are all positive, they repel each other. But if their positions are fixed, their potential energy is fixed, regardless of their arrangement. So perhaps the problem assumes
