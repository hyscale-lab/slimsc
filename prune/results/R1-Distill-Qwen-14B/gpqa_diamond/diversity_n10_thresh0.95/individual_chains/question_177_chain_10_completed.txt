Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, let's read the question again carefully.

Alright, so there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, same scaling for both radius and mass. But wait, does the mass even matter here? The question is about luminosity, which I think is related to temperature and radius. Oh right, because luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. So mass might not come into play unless we're considering other factors like gravitational effects or something else, but I think for black body radiation, it's about temperature and radius.

The next part says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, that means they have the same temperature. So T1 = T2. That's an important point because it affects the luminosity calculation.

Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. So if Star_1's radial velocity is zero, it's not moving much along our line of sight, but Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But how does radial velocity affect the observed luminosity? Hmm. Maybe it's about the Doppler effect affecting the observed wavelength, but since the peak wavelengths are already determined to be the same, perhaps that's accounted for. Or does it affect the observed brightness due to motion? Maybe it's about Doppler shifting the spectrum, but the question says they found the same wavelength for the peak brightness, implying that any Doppler shifts are considered.

Wait, but the question says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on the black body radiation. So maybe the Doppler effect is not directly affecting the black body calculation. Because, if a star is moving towards us, the light would be blueshifted, but since we're told the peak wavelengths are the same, perhaps the Doppler effect is already accounted for in determining their temperatures. Alternatively, maybe the radial velocity affects the observed temperature via Doppler broadening, but I'm not sure. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so their luminosity is calculated using the black body formula, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So the luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. Since we already established that T1 = T2 because the peak wavelengths are the same, then the luminosity ratio would be (R1²)/(R2²).

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, R1² = (1.5)^2 (R2)^2 = 2.25 R2². So L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) = (2.25 R2²)/(R2²) )= 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

Wait, but the options are A) ~2.25, D) ~2.23, etc. So option A is 2.25, which is exactly what we got. But wait, let me think again. Did I miss something? Because the problem also gives the radial velocities. Oh, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed luminosity due to the Doppler effect? Or the flux?

Wait, the radial velocity would cause a Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelength. But the problem says that the peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So that must mean that after any Doppler shifting, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the stars' rest frame temperatures are the same, or their observed temperatures are the same. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the radial velocity doesn't affect the calculation because the observed flux is being used, which accounts for both the intrinsic luminosity and the Doppler effect.

Wait, no. The luminosity is an intrinsic property; observed flux depends on luminosity and distance, but in this problem, the question is about the computed luminosity, assuming black body radiation. So maybe the radial velocity doesn't directly impact the calculation of luminosity, which is based on radius and temperature.

Wait, but considering that the stars have different velocities, perhaps their temperatures are not the same. Because if they are moving towards us, their light would be blueshifted, which would affect the observed peak wavelength. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler effect is considered in the calculation of their temperatures. So Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, would have its light Doppler shifted. To have the same observed peak wavelength as Star_1, which has zero velocity, the intrinsic temperatures must differ.

Wait, that's more complicated. Let me think again. If a star is moving towards us at velocity v, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted) by a factor of (1 + v/c), where v is positive for moving towards us. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_rest / (1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving towards us at v=700 km/s, then its observed lambda would be shorter than its rest frame lambda.

But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs. And for each star, lambda_obs = b / T_obs, where T_obs is the observed temperature. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the formula for the Doppler effect for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but that's for relativistic speeds. Or maybe the non-relativistic approximation: lambda_obs ≈ lambda_rest (1 - v/c).

Wait, perhaps I should model it. Let's denote:

For Star_1: v1 = 0 km/s, so no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is lambda1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving towards us, so v is positive. The Doppler effect for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) but wait, that's for relativistic Doppler shift. Alternatively, the approximation for non-relativistic speeds is lambda_obs ≈ lambda_rest (1 - v/c).

Wait, but if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, so lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 - v/c). Alternatively, the observed frequency is higher, which would imply higher temperature.

Wait, it's getting a bit messy. Let's try to model it properly.

The Doppler effect for light can be approximated as:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

But wait, that's for the transverse Doppler effect, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a source moving directly towards the observer, the Doppler shift formula is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 - v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ), but that's more for relativistic speeds. Hmm, perhaps I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength. So:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) ) ), where beta = v/c.

Wait, no, I think that's for the frequency. Let me check.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for frequency is f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ), where beta is v/c, and v is the approach speed. So if a star is moving towards us at speed v, the observed frequency is higher.

Since frequency and wavelength are inversely related (c = lambda * f), the Doppler shift for wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ).

So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter than its rest wavelength.

But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs = lambda.

Star_1 has v=0, so lambda1_obs = lambda_rest1 = b / T1.

Star_2 has v=700 km/s, which is 700,000 m/s. Let's compute beta = v/c. c is approx 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s.

Wait, v=700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. So beta = 700000 / (3e8) ≈ 0.002333.

So beta is about 0.002333, which is small, so maybe we can approximate.

So lambda2_obs = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

But lambda1_obs = lambda_rest1 = lambda.

And lambda2_obs = lambda.

So,

lambda = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

But lambda_rest2 = b / T2.

Similarly, lambda_rest1 = b / T1.

But we also know that lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Wait, wait. Let's think.

Wait, from the problem statement, the observed peak wavelengths are the same, so lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs = lambda.

But Star_1's lambda1_obs is its rest frame lambda (since v1=0), so lambda_rest1 = lambda.

Star_2's lambda_rest2 is different. Because when it moves, its observed lambda is due to Doppler shift.

So, lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ) = lambda.

So lambda_rest2 = lambda * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Because we can rearrange that equation to solve for lambda_rest2.

So lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Similarly, lambda_rest1 = lambda.

So since lambda_rest = b / T_rest, we can relate the temperatures.

For Star_1:

lambda_rest1 = b / T1.

For Star_2:

lambda_rest2 = b / T2.

But lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Wait, because lambda_rest2 is lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), and lambda_obs is the same as lambda_rest1. So,

lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

But lambda_rest1 = b / T1.

So,

lambda_rest2 = (b / T1) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But lambda_rest2 is also equal to (b / T2).

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T2 = (1/T1) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Hmm, that's the relation between the temperatures.

Now, beta is 700,000 m/s divided by speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s.

So beta = 700e3 / 3e8 = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333.

So beta is approximately 0.002333.

Compute (1 + beta) ≈ 1.002333, (1 - beta) ≈ 0.997667.

So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ approximately 1.0047.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

(1 + beta) = 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

(1 - beta) = 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667.

Divide them: 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ let me compute that.

1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ approximately 1.0047 (since 0.997667 is approx 0.9977, and 1.002333 / 0.9977 ≈ 1.0047).

So sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = sqrt(1.0047) ≈ 1.00235.

Because sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 for small x. 1.0047 is about 0.47% above 1, so x is about 0.0047. So sqrt(1.0047) ≈ 1 + 0.0047/2 = 1.00235.

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ) = T1 * (1/sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )) ) = T1 * (1/1.00235) ≈ T1 * 0.99765.

So T2 ≈ 0.99765 * T1.

So the temperature of Star_2 is slightly lower than that of Star_1. But since the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, this implies that the rest frame temperatures are different.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that T1 = T2 because their observed peak wavelengths are the same. But now, I'm considering that the Doppler shift affects the observed lambda, so their rest frame lambdas are different. So, the temperatures of the two stars are different.

So, the initial assumption that T1 equals T2 was incorrect. Because the observed lambda_max is the same, so the rest frame lambda_max of Star_2 is higher, meaning T2 is lower.

So now, the luminosity calculation is more complicated. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴.

So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

So, the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

T2 ≈ 0.99765 T1.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )² * T1^4 ) / ( R2² * (0.99765 T1 )^4 )

= (2.25 R2² * T1^4 ) / ( R2² * (0.99765)^4 T1^4 )

The R2² and T1^4 terms cancel out.

So,

= 2.25 / (0.99765)^4.

Compute (0.99765)^4:

Hmm, 0.99765 is approximately 0.99765.

Compute (0.99765)^2 first.

0.99765 * 0.99765 ≈ let's compute as (1 - 0.00235)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 * 0.00235 + (0.00235)^2 ≈ approximately 1 - 0.0047 + 0.0000055 ≈ 0.995305.

Then, square that again: (0.995305)^2 ≈ [1 - 0.004695]^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004695 + (0.004695)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00939 + 0.000022 ≈ 0.99063.

So (0.99765)^4 ≈ approximately 0.9906.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 0.9906 ≈ 2.272.

Wait, but that's approximately 2.27. Looking at the options, option B is ~2.32, option C is ~2.35, D is ~2.23, A is 2.25.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the approximation is not precise enough. Let me compute (0.99765)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute step by step.

Compute 0.99765^2:

0.99765 * 0.99765 =

Let me compute 0.99765 * 0.99765.

Let me write it as (1 - 0.00235)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00235 + (0.00235)^2.

2*0.00235 = 0.0047.

(0.00235)^2 = 0.0000055225.

So 1 - 0.0047 = 0.9953; plus 0.0000055225 gives 0.9953055225.

So 0.99765^2 ≈ 0.9953055225.

Now compute (0.9953055225)^2.

Which is (1 - 0.0046944775)^2.

Which is 1 - 2*(0.0046944775) + (0.0046944775)^2.

2 * 0.0046944775 ≈ 0.009388955.

(0.0046944775)^2 ≈ approx 0.000021995.

So 1 - 0.009388955 = 0.990611045. Plus 0.000021995 gives 0.99063304.

So (0.99765)^4 ≈ ~0.990633.

So 2.25 / 0.990633 ≈ ?

2.25 divided by 0.990633.

Let me compute this division. 2.25 / 0.990633.

Alternatively, 0.990633 is approximately 0.99063. So 2.25 ÷ 0.99063 ≈ ?

Well, 2.25 / 0.99 = approximately 2.2727. But since 0.99063 is a bit more than 0.99, the denominator is a bit larger, so the result is a bit less than 2.2727.

Wait, 0.99063 is 0.99 plus 0.00063. So 0.99063 is about 0.99 * (1 + 0.00637) ≈ 0.99 * 1.00637.

So 1/0.99063 ≈ (1/0.99) * (1/(1 + 0.00637)) ≈ (1.010101) * (1 - 0.00637) ≈ approximately 1.010101 - 0.006437 = 1.003664.

So 2.25 * 1.003664 ≈ 2.25 * 1.003664 ≈ 2.25 + 2.25 * 0.003664 ≈ 2.25 + 0.00825 ≈ 2.25825.

So approximately 2.258, which is about 2.26.

Wait, but the options are A)2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

So 2.258 is approximately 2.26, which is closest to option A)2.25 or D)2.23. Hmm, but wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let's compute 2.25 / 0.990633.

Let me perform the division.

Let me write 2.25 ÷ 0.990633.

Compute 0.990633 * 2.27 = ?

0.990633 * 2 = 1.981266.

0.990633 * 0.27 = ?

0.990633 * 0.2 = 0.1981266.

0.990633 * 0.07 = 0.06934431.

So 0.1981266 + 0.06934431 = 0.26747091.

So total 1.981266 + 0.26747091 = 2.2487369.

Which is very close to 2.25. So 0.990633 * 2.27 ≈ 2.2487, which is just under 2.25.

So the value 2.27 would give us 2.2487. How much more do we need to reach 2.25?

The difference is 2.25 - 2.2487 = 0.0013.

Each additional 0.001 in the multiplier gives 0.990633 * 0.001 = 0.000990633.

So 0.0013 / 0.000990633 ≈ 1.312.

So to cover the remaining 0.0013, we need about 0.001312.

So the multiplier is approximately 2.27 + 0.001312 = 2.2713.

So 2.2713 is approximately the value of 2.25 / 0.990633.

So approximately 2.271.

Which is around 2.27.

Wait, but wait, earlier step might have been a bit approximate. Let me try another approach. Let me compute 2.25 / 0.990633 precisely using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, compute 0.990633 * x = 2.25, find x.

We can write x = 2.25 / 0.990633.

Compute 2.25 ÷ 0.990633.

Let me compute as 2.25 ÷ 0.990633 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 ÷ 0.990633.

I can approximate this as follows:

Let me compute 0.990633 * 2.27 = ?

As above, 2.2487. So 2.27 gives 2.2487, which is 0.0013 less than 2.25.

So to find the exact value, the delta is 0.0013.

Each 0.001 in x adds 0.000990633 to the product.

So, 0.0013 / 0.000990633 ≈ 1.312.

So x is approximately 2.27 + 0.001312 ≈ 2.2713.

So 2.2713 is the value of x.

So 2.2713 ≈ 2.27.

So L1/L2 is approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options, option B is ~2.32, option D is ~2.23, which are the closest. 2.27 is closer to 2.27, which is between A (2.25) and D (2.23), but perhaps none are exactly that. Alternatively, perhaps my approximation is wrong, or maybe I should consider a more precise calculation of (0.99765)^4.

Wait, maybe I should compute (0.99765)^4 more accurately.

Compute 0.99765^4:

We already have 0.99765^2=0.9953055225.

So, 0.9953055225^2.

Compute this as (0.9953055225)^2.

Let me compute this step by step.

0.9953055225 * 0.9953055225.

Break it down:

= (1 - 0.0046944775)^2.

= 1^2 - 2 * 1 * 0.0046944775 + (0.0046944775)^2.

= 1 - 0.009388955 + (0.0046944775)^2.

Compute (0.0046944775)^2:

= (approx) 0.0046944775 * 0.0046944775.

= 0.000021996.

So,

1 - 0.009388955 = 0.990611045.

Add 0.000021996: 0.990611045 + 0.000021996 ≈ 0.990633041.

So, (0.99765)^4 ≈ 0.990633041.

So, 2.25 ÷ 0.990633041 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 ÷ 0.990633041.

Let me compute 0.990633041 * 2.27 = ?

0.990633041 * 2 = 1.981266082.

0.990633041 * 0.27:

Let me compute 0.990633041 * 0.2 = 0.198126608.

0.990633041 * 0.07 = 0.069344313.

So 0.198126608 + 0.069344313 = 0.267470921.

Add to 1.981266082: 1.981266082 + 0.267470921 = 2.24873699.

So 0.990633041 * 2.27 = 2.24873699.

But we need 2.25, so the difference is 2.25 - 2.24873699 = 0.00126301.

So, how much more x beyond 2.27 gives us an additional 0.00126301.

Since 0.990633041 * delta_x = 0.00126301.

delta_x ≈ 0.00126301 / 0.990633041 ≈ approximately 0.001275.

So x ≈ 2.27 + 0.001275 ≈ 2.271275.

So x ≈ 2.2713.

Which is approximately 2.271.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.271.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B) ~2.32, but that's higher than 2.27. None of the options are exactly 2.27. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Star_1's velocity is zero, and Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away from us, the Doppler effect would cause a redshift, making its observed wavelength longer. But the problem says that both observed wavelengths are the same. So Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter to compensate for the redshift.

Wait, no, if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, which is stationary, Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter. Because if it's moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, so to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, Star_2 must emit at a shorter wavelength.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

If a star is moving away at velocity v (positive v), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted).

If both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, then Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter than Star_1's.

Because when Star_2's light is redshifted, its observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's.

So, lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v/c), approximately, for small v.

Wait, no. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving away at v=700 km/s, then lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v/c).

But in the problem, lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1 = lambda.

lambda_obs1 is the rest wavelength of Star_1, so lambda_rest1 = lambda.

lambda_rest2 is the rest wavelength of Star_2.

So lambda = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v/c).

So,

lambda_rest2 = lambda / (1 + v/c).

Which implies that lambda_rest2 < lambda_rest1, since (1 + v/c) >1.

So,

lambda_rest1 = b / T1.

lambda_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 * (1 + v/c)^{-1}.

So,

lambda_rest2 = (b/T1) * 1/(1 + v/c) = (b/(T2)).

Wait, perhaps I should write the relationship between T1 and T2.

From lambda_rest = b / T,

lambda_rest2 = b / T2.

lambda_rest1 = b / T1.

But lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 * (1 + v/c)^{-1}.

So,

b/T2 = (b/T1) * 1/(1 + v/c).

Cancel b:

1/T2 = (1/(T1 (1 + v/c))).

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the rest wavelength must be shorter, which would imply a higher temperature. Because lambda_rest is shorter, since T is higher (because lambda = b/T).

Wait, let me think again.

If Star_2 is moving away at speed v, then its observed wavelength is longer. So,

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c).

We have lambda_obs = lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest of Star_1.

Wait, no, Star_1's lambda_rest is lambda_rest1, which is observed as lambda because it's not moving.

Star_2's lambda_rest is lambda_rest2, which is observed as lambda_obs2 = lambda.

So,

lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v/c) = lambda.

But lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1 = lambda.

So,

lambda_rest2 = lambda / (1 + v/c).

Similarly,

lambda_rest1 = lambda.

So,

lambda_rest1 = b / T1.

lambda_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v/c).

Cancel b,

1/T2 = (1/T1) / (1 + v/c).

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

Wait, that would mean T2 is larger than T1.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, it's observed wavelength is longer, so it must emit at a shorter wavelength to have the same observed lambda as Star_1. So, its rest frame has a shorter wavelength, implying higher temperature.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

Wait, but v is 700 km/s, which is positive when moving away.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting the signs wrong. Because if the star is moving away, v is positive in the denominator, but in the Doppler formula, for recession, v is positive and the observed wavelength is longer.

So in the formula,

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c).

v is positive for recession.

So, if Star_2 is moving away, then its lambda_rest must be smaller to have the same observed lambda as Star_1, which isn't moving.

So,

lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 / (1 + v/c).

Which implies that T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

So T2 is larger than T1.

So, earlier conclusion that T2 is lower than T1 was incorrect. Now, T2 is higher.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me re-express.

Star_1: v1 = 0. So lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s (moving away). So lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 → lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

So, lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 / (1 + v2/c).

But lambda_rest is inversely proportional to temperature: lambda_rest = b / T.

So,

lambda_rest1 = b / T1.

lambda_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 / (1 + v2/c).

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b,

1 / T2 = 1/( T1 (1 + v2/c) ).

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T2 is greater than T1.

So, T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, that makes more sense now. Because Star_2 is moving away, so to have the same observed lambda, its rest lambda must be shorter, which means higher temperature.

So the temperatures are T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

But wait, v is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So v/c = 7e5/(3e8) ≈ 0.002333.

So (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 is approximately 0.2333% higher than T1.

So now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (T1 * 1.002333)^4 )

= (2.25 R2² T1^4) / ( R2² T1^4 (1.002333)^4 )

= 2.25 / (1.002333)^4.

Compute (1.002333)^4.

Again, using the approximation for small x: (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2)x² + ... .

x = 0.002333.

n=4.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)*(0.002333)^2 + (4*3*2/6)*(0.002333)^3 + (4*3*2*1/24)*(0.002333)^4.

Compute each term:

Term 1: 1.

Term 2: 4 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.009332.

Term 3: 6 * (0.002333)^2 ≈ 6 * (0.000005442) ≈ 0.00003265.

Term 4: 4 * (0.002333)^3 ≈ 4 * (0.0000000125) ≈ 0.00000005.

Term 5: 1 * (0.002333)^4 ≈ 0.000000000029.

So summing:

1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332.

Plus 0.00003265 → 1.00936465.

Plus 0.00000005 → 1.0093647.

Plus 0.000000000029 → ~1.0093647.

So, (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So, 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 ÷ 1.009365.

Let me compute:

1.009365 * 2.23 = ?

1.009365 * 2 = 2.01873.

1.009365 * 0.23 = 0.232154.

So total ≈ 2.01873 + 0.232154 ≈ 2.25088.

Which is very close to 2.25.

So, 1.009365 * 2.23 ≈ 2.25088.

So 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ approximately 2.23.

Wait, that's interesting. Because 2.23 is one of the options, option D.

So, the L1/L2 ratio is approximately 2.23.

Wait, but according to our earlier expansion, (1.002333)^4 is about 1.009365, and 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ 2.23.

So, the answer would be approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the star moving towards us, I got a different result, but I think I made a mistake in the direction. Because when Star_2 is moving away, we have to adjust the temperature accordingly.

So, the correct approach is that because Star_2 is moving away, its rest frame temperature is higher than Star_1's. Therefore, the luminosity calculation ends up with L1/L2 ≈ 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(L\) is luminosity, \(R\) is radius, \(T\) is temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
From the problem, the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:
\[
R_1 = 1.5 R_2
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]
where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant, the observed peak wavelength depends on the star's temperature and its velocity due to the Doppler effect. For Star_2, moving away at \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is redshifted. The relationship between the rest-frame and observed wavelengths is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars:
\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

From Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\), so:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

Substituting \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):
\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{700 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.002333
\]
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + 0.002333) \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity formula:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1^2)(T_1^4)}{(R_2^2)(T_2^4)} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 (T_1^4)}{(R_2^2) \cdot (T_1 \cdot 1.002333)^4}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \((1.002333)^4\)
Using the binomial approximation for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.002333\):
\[
(1 + x)^n \approx 1 + nx + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^2 + \dots
\]
For \(n = 4\):
\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.002333) + \frac{4(3)}{2}(0.002333)^2
\]
\[
\approx 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003265 \approx 1.009365
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009365} \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2.
