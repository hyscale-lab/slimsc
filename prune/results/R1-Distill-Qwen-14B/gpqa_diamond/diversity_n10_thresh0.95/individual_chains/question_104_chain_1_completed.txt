Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth as the planet orbits it, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, equal to the Sun's. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. So, the planets are probably in the same mass category, but the question is about their orbital periods based on the RV measurements.

Wait, the RV method's signal depends on the planet's mass and its orbital period. Oh, right, the RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital parameters. The formula for K is something like K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) ) ... wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * [ (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )^(1/3)

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Since the planets have masses much smaller than the stars (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, the simplified formula when M_p << M_* is:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * (1/( (1 AU)^(1/3) )) )? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the equation for K.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate K (the semi-amplitude of the velocity) to the orbital period and the mass of the planet.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, it's approximately K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) c) )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the ratio of the two K values since the stars are the same mass and the planets are similar.

So, for planet 1 and planet 2, K1 = 5 mA, K2 =7 mA. Since the stars are the same, M_* is same for both. The masses of the planets are similar, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So, the ratio K1/K2 = [ (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) ) ] * [ ( (M_* + M_p2)^(2/3) ) / ( (M_* + M_p1)^(2/3) ) ) ]

But since M_* is same and M_p1 ≈ M_p2, the second ratio is approximately 1. So, K1/K2 ≈ (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

Wait, that's because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), but wait, wait. Let me think again. The formula for K is proportional to (M_p)/ ( (M_*) )^(1/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) ). So if K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 sin i1) / (M_*^(1/3) P1^(1/3)) ] / [ (M_p2 sin i2) / (M_*^(1/3) P2^(1/3)) ) ]

Assuming both have similar M_p and same inclination (sin i ≈ 1 for both), then K1/K2 = sqrt( (P2)/(P1) )^(1/3) )? Wait, no, because it's (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) ). So,

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But wait, in the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, K ∝ M_p / ( M_*^(1/3) P^(1/3) )

But M_p is same for both planets, M_* same for both stars, so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, that can't be right. Because if P is larger, the star's velocity would be smaller, so K would be smaller. So yes, K and P are inversely related. So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

So, K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * C, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * C, same C for both since M_p and M_* are same.

So, K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, that is because K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But wait, in the problem, K1 is 5 mA, K2 is7 mA. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1. So, we need P2 / P1.

Which is (5/7)^3. Let me compute that.

5^3=125, 7^3=343. So 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. That would mean that it's shorter, meaning planet #2 has a shorter period. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then the ratio P2/P1 is approximately 0.36, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long as P1. So planet #2's period is shorter.

Wait, but wait. The RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So when K is larger, the semi-amplitude is larger, which implies a shorter period. Because if K is larger, then 1/P^(1/3) is larger, so P is smaller.

So planet #2 has a larger K (7 mA vs 5 mA), so it must have a shorter period. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is shorter, then the factor is less than 1. So the options include 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure I set up the ratio correctly.

Suppose K1 = 5, K2=7.

From K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = (125/343) P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So P2 is about 0.364 × P1. So P2 is 0.364 times as long as P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, which is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is ~0.36.

So the question asks, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So the answer is approximately 0.36 times. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the correct option is A, ~0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), assuming the planet's mass \( M_p \) and the star's mass \( M_* \) are similar for both systems. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that planet #1 has a semi-amplitude \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{mA} \) and planet #2 has \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{mA} \), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is related to the ratio of the orbital periods as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1.
