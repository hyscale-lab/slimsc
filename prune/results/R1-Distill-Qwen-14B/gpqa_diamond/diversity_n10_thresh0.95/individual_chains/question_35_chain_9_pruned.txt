Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me break it down.

The problem statement says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator given by c·S. Oh, right, c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, let's write down the matrix S first. S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And since Ay = c·S, substituting c = h/(4π), so Ay is:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, the matrix becomes:

Ay = [[0, -(i h)/(4π)],
      [(i h)/(4π), 0]]

Eigenvalues of Ay are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

The matrix Ay - λI would be:

[-λ, -(i h)/(4π)],
[(i h)/(4π), -λ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Which is λ² - [ (i * -i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, i times -i is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (h²)/(16 π²).

So the equation becomes λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Solving for λ: λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/1) ?

Wait, h/(4π) is c, right? So eigenvalues are ± c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right? Because the equation gives λ² = (h²)/(16 π²), so taking square roots gives real values.

Wait, but wait a second. The matrix Ay is a 2x2, so it should have two eigenvalues. Are they real or complex? Because the matrix isn't symmetric. Wait, but the eigenvalues could be real if the matrix is Hermitian.

Wait, is Ay a Hermitian matrix? Let me check.

The Hermitian conjugate of Ay is (Ay)†. Ay has elements a_ij where a_11 is 0, a_12 is -(i h)/(4π), a_21 is (i h)/(4π), a_22 is 0. So the conjugate transpose would swap off-diagonal terms and take complex conjugates.

a_12† is (i h/(4π))*, so that's (-i h/(4π)). Similarly, a_21† is (i h/(4π))*, which is (-i h/(4π)).

So the (Ay)† matrix is:

[0, (i h)/(4π)],
[-(i h)/(4π), 0]

Which is the same as the original Ay matrix because the original Ay has a_12 as -(i h)/(4π) and a_21 as (i h)/(4π). So yes, Ay is Hermitian because Ay† = Ay. Therefore, the eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts must be incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, that can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So this option is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's also wrong because the eigenvalues are real. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Hmm. Let's think. The operator A² is the square of the angular momentum, which in quantum mechanics, for spin-1/2 particles, A² should have eigenvalues (ħ²)(s(s+1)), where s=1/2 for a muon. So A² is a scalar (same for any direction) and commutes with all components. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of A² are the same for any component, like Ay. So if a function is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². But what about Az? Well, since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigen
