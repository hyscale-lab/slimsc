Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when you're dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

So the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u' - v) / (1 - (u'v)/(c²)). But wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. The correct formula for the relative speed u between two objects moving at speeds v and u' (as seen from different frames) is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/(c²)). Or is it (v - u')/(1 - (v u')/(c²))? Hmm, I think I might have it backwards. Oh wait, I think the formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/(c²)), but since both are moving in the same direction, u' is the speed of one astronaut, and v is the speed of the other. Wait no, let me think again. If astronaut A is moving at speed v and astronaut B is moving at speed u' in the same direction as A, then the relative speed of B as seen from A's frame is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/(c²)). 

Wait, but in this case, the problem is asking for the relative speed of each as seen from the other's frame, or maybe one as seen from the other. Or perhaps, what is the speed of one as measured from the other's frame. Let's clarify. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 2? Or vice versa.

Wait, given that both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.5 - 0.6 is -0.1. But since speed is a magnitude, perhaps we take the absolute value. So (0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/c²). Because 0.5 * 0.6 is 0.3, and c squared is c². So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So (0.1c)/0.7 = 0.1428... approximately 0.14c. Oh wait, but wait, that's the speed of astronaut 2 relative to astronaut 1. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy. So the total energy E is the sum of their energies. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c: 

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = Gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut, mass 3m and speed 0.5c:

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = Gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = approx 5.964 m c². So the total energy is about 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B says E=4.96 mc², which doesn't match. Option D says E=5 mc², which is a bit off. So the correct option for energy is 5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u' - v}{1 - \frac{u'v}{c^2}}
\]
Here, \(u' = 0.5c\) (speed of astronaut 2) and \(v = 0.6c\) (speed of astronaut 1). Substituting these values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = 0.14c
\]
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

1. **For astronaut 1** (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **For astronaut 2** (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

Adding the two energies:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
