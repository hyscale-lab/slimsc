--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a cage-like molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure.

The first reaction is heating this with excess KOH at 240°C to form product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are given. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone. The NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Let me think about possible products from dibromoadamantane and KOH.

Wait, when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with KOH, they typically undergo elimination to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. But this is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation but not elimination because the bromines are on 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction? But with KOH, which is a strong base, and heating, substitution would lead to some product. Oh, wait, if it's a dihalide, maybe it's a double elimination? Or perhaps it's an epoxide formation?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. When two bromines are on adjacent carbons, you get elimination. But here, it's 1 and 3. So perhaps each Br is in a position that allows for elimination when treated with a base. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would lead to diol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which wouldn't be the case for a diol. So maybe it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a double elimination, leading to an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on opposite ends of the adamantane structure. So if each Br is abstracted by KOH, perhaps the adjacent carbons lose H and form a double bond. But I'm not sure if that's feasible in this structure. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination where each Br leaves, and adjacent Hs are abstracted, forming a more substituted double bond. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromo), you get elimination forming an alkene. But in a 1,3-dibromide, maybe each Br is in a position that allows for a double elimination, forming a diene? Or maybe a ring-opening.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where both Br atoms are replaced by hydroxide groups. But if that were the case, the product would be 1,3-diol adamantane. But then the IR would show O-H stretches, which I don't think are mentioned here. The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester or ketone. So substitution to diol doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann elimination or something similar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for cyclic esters.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ could be a ketone. So perhaps the product is an ketone. How would that happen? If each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that doesn't directly lead to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: look at the NMR data. The product 1 has an NMR with a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a region typical for CH₂ groups attached to electronegative atoms, like oxygen. Maybe an -O-CH₂-O- group? Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent group.

Wait, 4.79 ppm is around where you'd expect a CH₂ next to an oxygen, like in an ether or an ester. But let's think about the structure. If the product has a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Epoxides typically show signals around 3-4 ppm, but sometimes higher if the ring is strained. Wait, but in the product 1 NMR, 4.79 is for 2H. Maybe it's a CH₂ group next to two carbonyls, like a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how?

Hold on, another thought: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes two elimination reactions, each producing a double bond. But the positions are such that it forms an allene (conjugated diene) or a substituted cyclopropane? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxide, but that would form a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H (like broad peaks around 3000 cm⁻¹). Instead, it's a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a gem-diol, but that's not possible with two Brs on the same carbon, which isn't the case here.

Wait another angle: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide. Wait, how would that happen? Epoxides are usually formed via peracid epoxidation of alkenes.

Wait, but maybe the product is a cyclopropane? No, I don't think so. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, then the diol loses water via elimination to form a ketone. But that seems a stretch.

Wait, another thought: perhaps each Br is replaced by a ketone. But that doesn't make sense because substitution would replace Br with hydroxide, not a carbonyl.

Wait, could it be that the KOH is acting as a base, leading to elimination to form a carbonyl? Like through a keto-enol tautomerism. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but then in the next step, something else happens. Wait, the first product is treated with excess Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Then product 2 is ozonized to form product 3, and we're looking at the NMR of product 3.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the reactions and see what they might produce.

So, product 1 is made from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. The IR suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But that's not possible in a substitution reaction. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated with the formation of a double bond, but then how does that lead to a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, each Br forming a double bond, leading to a diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a ketone via some elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-dioxygenated adamantane, but that doesn't directly clarify.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a diepoxide. No, but then the IR would show epoxide C-O-C stretching around 1200 cm⁻¹, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: maybe the product is a glycol, but that would have OH groups, which would show in IR as broad peaks. The IR given doesn't mention that, so maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again. The product 1's 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a CH₂ group next to two oxygen atoms, like an ester or an ether. If it's an ester, then maybe it's an O-CO-O group. Alternatively, it could be a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, 4.79 ppm for 2H. Suppose it's a CH₂ connected to two carbonyl groups, maybe as part of an acetal or something else. Or perhaps it's a CH₂ group attached to an oxygen which is attached to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but then the IR would show O-H. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the epoxide forming between carbons 1 and 3. But would that make sense? The IR of an epoxide typically shows a strong peak around 1250 cm⁻¹, which is the C-O-C stretching. The given IR is at 1720, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the product is a diketone. So each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. Can that happen? But substitution of Br with carbonyl would require some kind of oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an hydroxide, which then is oxidized to a ketone. But how would that happen under KOH conditions?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, each Br leaving as Br⁻, and the adjacent Hs abstracted by OH⁻, leading to the formation of a double bond. But if both Brs are eliminated, perhaps forming a diene. But the NMR data doesn't immediately suggest that.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is perhaps a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, perhaps the product is a glycol, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol. Wait, but again, that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via some kind of elimination. For example, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, perhaps eliminating HBr and forming a double bond, but that would require the two Brs to be vicinal, which they are not. So maybe each Br is eliminated individually, forming two double bonds. But that seems unlikely in adamantane's structure.

Wait, perhaps each Br is involved in a substitution reaction, leading to a secondary alcohol. But again, that would need two OH groups, which doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm, I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to think of what product 1 might be. Maybe it's a diepoxide? No, because that doesn't match the IR. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. How?

Wait, another approach: the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, probably an ester or ketone. The NMR peaks: 4.79 (2H) could be a CH₂ next to a carbonyl. Then the 2.41-2.23 (10H) and 1.94 (2H) could be the adamantane carbons. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone substituted on the adamantane. But how?

Wait, maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, which then is oxidized. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces elimination, forming a carbonyl group. But that would require some mechanism I'm not remembering.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, each Br leaving and forming a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure how that works. If each Br is on a tertiary carbon, perhaps elimination leads to a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, not carbonyls. Unless it's a keto-enol type situation.

Wait, wait. If each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another carbon that can form a double bond, perhaps the elimination forms a double bond and a ketone. For example, in a vicinal dihalide, elimination leads to an alkene, but if the structure allows for conjugation, maybe a carbonyl is formed. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, and then some rearrangement happens. I think I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should move on to the next steps and see if that helps.

So product 1 is then heated with excess Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Al isopropoxide is often used in the formation of epoxides or in certain eliminations. Alternatively, it's a Lewis acid catalyst. Maybe it's used for dehydration or for forming rings.

Then, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds. The conditions of -78°C suggest controlled conditions to prevent further reactions, like reductive workup. So product 3 would be the result of ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Looking at the NMR of product 3, we're to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange (like OH or NH, but in this case, DMS is added so maybe not).

So, to find the coupling pattern, I need to figure out the structure of product 3, which comes after ozonolysis of product 2.

Wait, let me recap:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl, NMR shows 4.79 for 2H) → product 2 (heated with Al isopropoxide) → product 3 (ozonolysed).

So, product 3 is after ozonolysis of product 2. So product 2 must have a double bond that, when ozonolyzed, breaks into carbonyl groups.

Assuming that, product 2 must have a double bond somewhere in the structure. So perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide, but that might not fit.

Wait, alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when heated with Al isopropoxide, it forms an epoxide (though I'm not certain about the conditions for that). Then, ozonolysis of the epoxide's double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups.

But let me think in steps again.

Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1. IR shows carbonyl, so perhaps product 1 is a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, each Br is removed, and each adjacent H is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by a ketone. But substitution would require something like SN2, but with two Brs on opposite positions. Unlikely.

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, and then the diol loses two water molecules to form a triple bond, but that would require an elimination. But that would typically form a double bond, not a triple.

Wait, maybe it's a more complex elimination. Let me think about the mechanism. KOH is a strong base. Each Br is a good leaving group.

In 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Bridgehead eliminations are tricky due to Bredt's rule, which says that bridgehead double bonds are unstable in small rings. But adamantane's structure is rigid, so perhaps the bridgehead can undergo some elimination.

Wait, if each Br leaves, and adjacent Hs are abstracted, forming double bonds. But if each Br is on a bridgehead, elimination would form a diene, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated, and the resulting structure has a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't show C=C peaks (like around 1650 cm⁻¹). It shows a carbonyl, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is an epoxide. But I don't think so because the IR doesn't show the typical C-O-C stretch.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the product 2 and product 3.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a solid, maybe a ketone. So perhaps product 2 is an acetylation product, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide formed via some reaction with Al isopropoxide. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol, heating with Al isopropoxide might dehydrate it to form an alkene, via elimination. Then, product 2 would have a double bond, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

Wait, if product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, considering the NMR of product 3, we're to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H. So the most deshielded H would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

But the question is, what's the coupling pattern?

For example, if the H is adjacent to a carbonyl (like in a ketone), and perhaps is next to a CH₂ group with coupling, it would have a certain pattern.

But perhaps I should think about the structure after ozonolysis.

If product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would break it into fragments with carbonyl groups. The coupling in the NMR would depend on the neighboring Hs.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure of product 3.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene in the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two new carbonyls, and the hydrogen environment around them would determine their coupling.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, the workup (like with dimethyl sulfide) would give aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substitution of the double bond.

For example, if the double bond was in a symmetric position, the ozonolysis would give two identical carbonyl compounds. But if it's asymmetric, it would give different products.

Assuming product 2 is a trans-alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups with certain H environments.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure.

Wait, let me think again about the reactions.

Product 1 is made from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Product 1 has a carbonyl group. So perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide? No, because that wouldn't explain the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a geminal diol, but that's not possible with two Brs on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via a double elimination. For example, each Br is eliminated with the abstraction of Hs from adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about this mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but then the diol is oxidized to a ketone. But under KOH conditions, I don't think that would happen.

Wait, maybe the product 1 is a peroxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to look for similar reactions. 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH might undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an ene structure. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be CH₂ groups in the adamantane structure, and 1.94 (2H) maybe another CH₂.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, the 4.79 would be for the OH-bearing CH₂ groups. But without O-H signals in IR, perhaps it's not a diol.

Wait, perhaps it's an acetal. If product 1 is an acetal, the 4.79 ppm would be for the CH₂-O groups. But then the IR would show a C-O-C stretch, which isn't mentioned.

Hmm. Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be a CH₂ connected to two carbonyls, making it deshielded.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a diketone. So each Br is replaced by a ketone group. But substitution would require each Br to be replaced with a ketone, which isn't straightforward with KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a ketone via some elimination.

Wait, maybe the product 1 is a monoketone. But how? If only one Br is replaced, but the other isn't, that would give a mono-substituted product, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so both would react.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ring, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide.

Then, ozonolysis of the epoxide would not make sense because epoxides don't have double bonds. Wait, but if product 2 is an alkene (from dehydration of product 1, the diol), then ozonolysis would break the double bond.

So let me outline:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (diol) with KOH.

But then, product 1's IR doesn't show O-H peaks. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a mesylate or something else. No, that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, let's think about the reactions again. If product 1 is a diol, and then product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination (with Al isopropoxide as a catalyst), then product 3 would be the ozonolysis product of that alkene.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Assuming the alkene is in a symmetric position, the ozonolysis would yield two carbonyl groups attached to similar structures.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

So, for example, if the structure is something like O=C-(CH₂)n-CH₂-C=O, the Hs on the CH₂ next to carbonyl would be deshielded.

The coupling pattern would depend on neighboring Hs. If each CH₂ is next to another CH₂ with two Hs, the coupling would be a quartet or something else.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded H. The most deshielded would be closest to the electronegative group, like the carbonyl.

So, perhaps this H is a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. If each CH₂ has two Hs and is adjacent to another CH₂ group with two Hs, the coupling would be a quartet (each H couples with two Hs on adjacent CH₂).

Wait, but let me think about the splitting. Each H on the CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, no. Wait, each CH₂ has two Hs. Each H on CH₂ A couples with the two Hs on CH₂ B. So each H would split into a triplet. Because each CH₂ has two Hs, each H on A would see two Hs on B, so the splitting would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, if there are more than one coupling partners, the splitting can become more complex. For example, if a CH₂ is between two other CH₂ groups, each with two Hs, then each H on the central CH₂ would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH₂. That would lead to a septet (for each coupling, but I'm not sure).

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH₂ group that is adjacent to two other CH₂ groups, each with two Hs. So each H on the central CH₂ would couple with four Hs in total: two from each adjacent CH₂. The number of peaks would be n+1, where n is the number of neighboring Hs. So four neighboring Hs (two on each side) would lead to quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks). But wait, would they be equivalent?

Alternatively, if the Hs are coupled to two sets of two Hs each, the multiplicity would be a doublet of doublets, but that's if each coupling is to a different group. Alternatively, if both couplings are similar, it might be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me think. If a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with a different coupling constant, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets. For example, if each H on CH₂ A is coupled to two Hs on CH₂ B (J1) and two Hs on CH₂ C (J2), then each peak would split into four, resulting in a quartet. But if J1 and J2 are different, it might be a doublet of doublets.

But if the two adjacent CH₂ groups are identical, then the coupling constants would be the same, so the splitting would be a triplet: each H would couple with four Hs (two on each side), but wait, that's not possible because each H can only couple with adjacent Hs. Wait, no, each H on CH₂ is adjacent to two Hs on each of the neighboring CH₂ groups. So each H on the central CH₂ would have four neighboring Hs (two from each side). But since they're all equivalent, perhaps the splitting would be a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks).

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Hmm, another approach: perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diol with two carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded H is in a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl.

If the structure is something like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, each CH₂ group would have Hs that are next to a carbonyl.

In this case, each CH₂ group's Hs would couple with the adjacent CH₂ group's Hs. So each H on the CH₂ would see two Hs on the next CH₂, leading to a triplet.

Wait, so each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. So option A is triplet.

But wait, let's say the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. The middle CH₂'s Hs would be next to two Hs on each side. Wait, no, each CH₂ is between two carbonyls. So each CH₂ in the center would have two neighboring CH₂ groups. Wait, no, in this case, the structure would be O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. So each CH₂ is between two carbonyls. Wait, but that would make each CH₂ have two Hs on each side? Hmm, no, the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. So each CH₂ is connected to a carbonyl on each end. So each CH₂ group is in the center, between two carbonyls.

In that case, each CH₂ group would have two Hs, and each H would be next to two Hs on either side. Wait, no, each CH₂ is attached to the carbonyl, so the next group is the other CH₂.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. So each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂. Each H on the left CH₂ would couple with two Hs on the right CH₂. So each H on the left would split into a triplet. Similarly, each H on the right would split into a triplet.

So in the NMR, the Hs on the CH₂ groups would appear as triplets.

So the most deshielded H (those next to carbonyl) would be triplet.

So the answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the final answer:

### Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH
- **Starting material**: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, a diamondoid structure with bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3.
- **Reaction conditions**: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C.
- **Product 1**: The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative group, likely oxygen. The remaining peaks (2.41-2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm) correspond to the adamantane framework.
- **Conclusion**: Product 1 is likely a diketone, where each bromine atom is replaced by a carbonyl group. This is consistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with Al Isopropoxide
- **Reaction conditions**: Heating with excess aluminum isopropoxide.
- **Product 2**: Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in dehydration reactions. Given that product 1 is a diketone, product 2 is likely an alkene formed by dehydration of the diketone. The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined but is inferred to contain a double bond.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2
- **Reaction conditions**: Ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide.
- **Product 3**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. If product 2 is an alkene, product 3 will contain carbonyl groups at the sites of the former double bond.

### Step 4: NMR Analysis of Product 3
- **Objective**: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, excluding those that exchange with the deuterated solvent.
- **Key consideration**: The most deshielded hydrogen will be adjacent to a carbonyl group. In the ozonolysis product, the carbonyl groups will influence the splitting pattern of nearby hydrogens.
- **Structure of product 3**: Assuming the alkene in product 2 was symmetric, product 3 will likely contain two carbonyl groups. The hydrogens adjacent to these carbonyls will be deshielded and exhibit coupling with neighboring hydrogens.
- **Coupling pattern**: Each hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group will couple with two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This results in a splitting pattern of a **triplet**.

### Final Answer
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a **triplet**.

ANSWER: A
