Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

Okay, the question says the unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's go through each piece of data one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the problem says "very broad," which might make me think of an alcohol since acids might have a broader, more like a strong, maybe even a very broad peak, but also, maybe it's an O-H from something else. Hmm.

Then, two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are key. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 is a bit lower, which might suggest something else. Wait, I remember that conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl could cause a shift. Oh, right, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Because the 1650 could be a C=C stretching, but wait, no, that's usually around 1600-1680. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl in a conjugated system. Wait, but the 1700 is a strong peak, perhaps the main carbonyl, and the 1650 could be an adjacent group, like an aromatic ring or another functional group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. It mentions several peaks, including vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond. That makes sense because FTIR showed a peak around 1650, which could be the C=C stretch. So combining that, maybe the compound has an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester with a double bond nearby.

Moving on to the Mass Spectrometry data. The fragment peak is at m/z 45. What fragments give m/z 45? I'm thinking of common fragments. For example, a methyl group (15) wouldn't be it. Maybe an ethylene fragment (28) or something else. Wait, another possibility is a fragment with a carbonyl group, like an acetyl (43?), but 45 isn't that. Oh, wait, another common fragment is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's more for aromatic structures. Alternatively, maybe a ketene ion or something else.

Alternatively, m/z 45 could correspond to the molecular ion of a smaller compound. Let me think about the possible formulas. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Wait, the molecular ion would be the mass of the compound. Let's calculate the molecular weights:

C6H12O2: (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) =72+12+32=116 g/mol.

C6H10O: (72)+(10)+(16)=98.

C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

C6H12O:72+12+16=100.

Hmm, so the molecular ion would be one of these. But the MS shows a fragment at 45. So what fragments would give 45?

Wait, wait. The molecular formula could split in certain ways. Let's think about possible fragments.

What about a CH3CO+ group? That would be 43 (12 + 16 + 12 + 16 + 1?), no, wait: CH3CO+ would be (12*2) + (1*3) + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43. Not 45. But maybe something else.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a (CH2)2O group? No, that's 12*2 + 2*2*1 + 16 =24+4+16=44. Not 45.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is one of the four options. Let's think about what their possible fragments would look like.

Take option A) C6H12O2. Possible fragments: maybe losing a water molecule (18), giving C6H11O (72+11 +16=99?), but I don't know. Or perhaps breaking into a smaller fragment. Alternatively, if it's an ester, maybe losing the R group and leaving a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, for option C) C6H10O2, which has more oxygen. Maybe it's an ester or a ketone with an ester group.

Wait, perhaps the fragment at 45 is a CH3COO group? No, that would be 60 (for CH3COO-). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the mass 45 is a common fragment. Let me think of other possibilities. For example, the methyl group in an acetate ester. Wait, the acetate ion is CH3COO- which would be m/z 60. So that's not 45.

Wait, maybe a propyl group? No, that's 42. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2 group attached to something. Or maybe the fragment is a ketene, which has a molecular formula of O=C=O. No, that's 44. Wait, 45 is 45. Let me think of the possible atoms in 45.

45 is the mass. So, possible combinations:

Carbon: 3 carbons (3*12=36) plus other atoms. 36 + 9=45. 9 could be 9 H (if it's H9, but that's unlikely) or 9 as O (but O is 16, which is too big). Alternatively, maybe 2 carbons. 2*12=24. 45-24=21. 21 could be 3 Nitrogens (but the formula doesn't have N), or maybe 21 as 1 O (16) and 5 H (5). But that seems tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is C3H9O. Let's see: 3*12=36, 9*1=9, 16=16. 36+9+16=61. No, that's too big.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about what the mass 45 could correspond to. Maybe a fragment like (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. The molecular weight of acetone is 58 (12*3 + 6 = 36 +6=42? No, wait: 12*3 is 36, each H is 1: (CH3)2CO is C3H6O. So 3*12=36, 6=6, 16=16. 36+6+16=58. So that's not 45.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is a ketone group, like a CH2=O. No, that's formaldehyde, which is 30. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of a larger group. For instance, if the compound is an ester, maybe the ester group (RCOOR') could break into RCOO- and R'. If R is CH3 and R' is something else, then the RCOO- would have a molecular weight of 60 (CH3COO is 44?), wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is either C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Looking at the options, let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For each option:

A) C6H12O2:

DoU = (2*6
