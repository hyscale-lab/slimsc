Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me take a deep breath and try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about an electron state and some measurements involving spin operators. Hmm.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, right, the z-projection eigenstates are |up> and |down>. First, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, but probabilities depend on normalization.

So, the normalization process. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's compute the norm. The inner product of |alpha> with itself is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i), because for orthogonal states, the cross terms drop out. Wait, no, actually when you take the inner product, it's the sum of the squares of the magnitudes. Oh right, because |a|^2 + |b|^2 is the norm for a two-component state.

Calculating each term: |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> divided by sqrt(7). Got it.

Now, the first part of the question is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator whose matrix Aij is given. The matrix elements are Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the dimension here? The state is two-dimensional, so the matrix is 2x2. So A is:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the operator in question is (hbar/2) times σ_x. Now, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the operator A has eigenvalues (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the same as the eigenstates of A, right? Because A is a scalar multiple of σ_x. So to find the eigenstates, I can recall that the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, what's the exact form? The eigenstate for σ_x with eigenvalue +1 is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the one with eigenvalue -1 is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). No, wait, no. Let me think. The Pauli X matrix acts on the spin states. Let me double-check: σ_x |up> = |down>, σ_x |down> = |up>. So, the eigenstates are the states that are symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange.

So for eigenvalue +1: |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). For eigenvalue -1: |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or was it (|up> + i |down>)/sqrt(2) and similar? No, wait, no. Wait, σ_x is real, so the eigenstates are real combinations. Right, so |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Hmm, but wait, I think actually the coefficients are 1 and 1. Or maybe I should compute them.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the eigenvectors. Let me think: for the matrix A, which is [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]], the eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λ I) =0.

So the characteristic equation is (0-λ)(0-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 =0 → λ^2 - (hbar^2/4) =0 → λ= ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, for the eigenvectors. For λ= hbar/2, the matrix becomes:

[ [-hbar/2, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, -hbar/2] ]

Setting up (A - λ I)|v> =0 → equations:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 =v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1), which when normalized is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, for λ= -hbar/2, the matrix is:

[ [hbar/2, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, hbar/2] ]

So the equations are (hbar/2)(v1 + v2 )=0 → v1 = -v2. So eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized to (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Got it.

Now, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate when the system is in |alpha>.

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all over sqrt(7). We can write this as (a|up> + b|down>), where a= (1+i)/sqrt(7), and b= (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

We need to find the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate |+x> and |-x>.

The probability for each eigenstate is |<eigenstate | alpha>|^2.

So first, compute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so < +x | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

So this becomes [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Simplify numerator: 1 +i +2 -i =3. So (3)/(sqrt(14)).

So the inner product is 3/sqrt(14). The probability is the square of the absolute value. So (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14 ≈0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities. 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 14-9=5, so 5/14 is about 0.3571, which is about 0.36. So that matches option A.

But wait, let me check the other eigenvector. Let's compute < -x | alpha >.

|-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so < -x | is ( <up| - <down| )/sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha > = [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Multiply them out: (1+i) - (2 -i) all over sqrt(2)*sqrt(7).

Compute numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i ) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The absolute value squared is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 /14.

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) =1 +4=5. So 5/14 ≈0.3571, which is about 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A. So the first two parts of the answer are 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the third part asks for the average value of that operator. The average value is <alpha| A | alpha>.

Wait, A is the operator whose matrix is Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So in matrix form, A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Alternatively, since A = (hbar/2) σ_x, and the average value of σ_x is <alpha | sigma_x | alpha>.

So, <A> = (hbar/2) * <sigma_x>.

Alternatively, compute <alpha| A |alpha> directly.

Let me compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed in the |up>, |down> basis, |alpha> is (1+i, 2 -i)^T / sqrt(7). So the bra vector is (1 -i, 2 +i)/sqrt(7).

A is the matrix [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]].

So compute <alpha| A |alpha> = (1 -i)(2 -i) * (hbar/2)/7 + (2 +i)(1 +i) * (hbar/2)/7.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it as a matrix product.

Wait, |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So A |alpha> is:

[ 0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)(2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7)
[ (hbar/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

So A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) in the first component, and [ (hbar/2)(1 + i) ] / sqrt(7) in the second component.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate of the first component times the first component of A|alpha>, plus the conjugate of the second component times the second component of A|alpha>.

So:

= [ (1 -i) / sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) ) ] + [ (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(1 +i) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Multiply hbar/2 and 1/(7) outside.

So,

= (hbar/2)(1/7) [ (1 -i)(2 - i) + (2 +i)(1 + i) ]

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i *2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 =-1)
=1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 +2i +i +i^2
= 2 +3i -1
=1 +3i.

Adding the two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the average value is (hbar/2)(1/7)*2 = (hbar/2)*(2/7) = hbar/7.

Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, option A gives hbar/7 as the average. So option A's average is hbar/7.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Did I compute the terms correctly?

Let me re-calculate:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i +i^2
= 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2
= 2 +2i +i + (-1)
= (2-1) +3i →1 +3i.

Sum: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2. So the sum is 2.

So the average is (hbar/2)(2)/7 = hbar/(7). So yes, that's correct.

So the average is hbar/7, which matches option A.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: since the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x, and the average value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in |alpha> state.

The expectation value of σ_x is <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which in computational basis is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, <sigma_x> = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7 + (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Wait, that's the same calculation as before.

Wait, compute (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 → 2-3i -1 =1-3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1)+i^2 → 2+2i +i -1 =1+3i.

Sum: 1-3i +1+3i =2.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Therefore, <A> = (hbar/2)(2/7) = hbar/7.

Yes, that's correct. So the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's the correct option.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if the probabilities add up. 0.64 + 0.36 =1. That's correct.

So I think the answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in the state |α>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A is to be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α>
The given state is |α> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize, compute the norm:
\[
\| |α> \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A is given by:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, \( \sigma_x \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up> + |down> \right), \quad |-x> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up> - |down> \right).
\]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring each eigenstate
The probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is:
\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x | α \rangle|^2.
\]
Substituting \( |+x> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up> + |down> \right) \) and \( |α> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> \right) \):
\[
\langle +x | α \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
Thus:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

Similarly, the probability of measuring |-x> is:
\[
P(-x) = |\langle -x | α \rangle|^2.
\]
Substituting \( |-x> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up> - |down> \right) \):
\[
\langle -x | α \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
Thus:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of the operator A
The average value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α | A | α \rangle.
\]
Substituting \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \) and \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in the state |α> is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) \right).
\]
Compute:
\[
(1-i)(2+i) = 2 + i - 2i - i^2 = 2 - i + 1 = 3 - i,
\]
\[
(2+i)(1-i) = 2 - 2i + i - i^2 = 2 - i + 1 = 3 - i.
\]
Adding these:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( (3 - i) + (3 - i) \right) = \frac{6}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
