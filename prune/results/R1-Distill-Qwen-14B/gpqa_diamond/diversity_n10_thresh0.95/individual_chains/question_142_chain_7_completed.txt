Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are A through D, each with a different vector r.

Wait, what do I know about density matrices? A density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, which can be a mixed state. For a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. I remember that for a pure state |psi><psi|, the density matrix is a pure state, but here rho is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with a 1/2 coefficient. So this must be a maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

But the question is about the geometrical position. Oh right, I think when you represent a qubit state in the Bloch sphere, the density matrix corresponds to a point on the sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (rx, ry, rz). When rho is a pure state, r would be a vector of length 1, pointing from the origin to the surface. For a mixed state, the length of r is less than 1.

So let's write rho in terms of the Pauli matrices. The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term.

|0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Wait, but that's multiplied by 1/2, so rho becomes I/2.

Wait, so rho = I/2. Now, the identity matrix can be written as (I + 0·σ)/2. Because if r is (0,0,0), then r·σ (which is rx σx + ry σy + rz σz) would be zero. So rho = (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

So in terms of the Bloch vector, r is (0,0,0). That would place the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because it's a completely mixed state—there's no preferred direction, so it's the maximally uncertain state.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). Let me make sure. The other options: A is (1,1,0), which would be a vector of length sqrt(2), so the state would be on the Bloch sphere but somewhere in the x-y plane. B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole, corresponding to the state |0>. D is (1,1,1), which would be a longer vector. But our rho is I/2, so r must be zero.

So the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit density matrix, it can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), we compute:

\[
\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Adding these matrices gives the identity matrix \( I \), and multiplying by \( \frac{1}{2} \) results in \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \). Comparing this with the general form \( \rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} \), we see that \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \):** This corresponds to a vector of length \( \sqrt{2} \), placing the state on the Bloch sphere in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. This is incorrect.
- **B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \):** This corresponds to the north pole of the Bloch sphere, representing the pure state \( \left|0\right\rangle \). This is incorrect.
- **C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \):** This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state. This is correct.
- **D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \):** This corresponds to a vector of length \( \sqrt{3} \), placing the state on the Bloch sphere. This is incorrect.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
