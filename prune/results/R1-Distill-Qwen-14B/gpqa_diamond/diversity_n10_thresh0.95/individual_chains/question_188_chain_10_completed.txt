--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles the same. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and each angle alpha, beta, gamma is 30 degrees. The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is related to the lattice parameters. Oh wait, the general formula for d is given by d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + ... something with the angles... I'm a bit fuzzy on that part.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case of a hexagonal or something else? No, wait, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. Oh right, it's a cubic system with all edges equal and all angles equal. So a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma.

So the unit cell is a rhombohedron. In such a case, the formula for the interplanar distance might be simplified because a, b, c are all the same and the angles are the same.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is d_hkl = [ (a^2 (b c l - a d sin gamma term...)) ] Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 hk cos beta + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos alpha ) )

Wait, but no, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for a rhombohedral system, since all the edges are equal and the angles are same, there's a simplified formula.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance d in a cubic system is a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2), but that's when all angles are 90 degrees. But when the angles aren't 90, it's more complex.

Ah, right! The correct formula when the angles are not 90 degrees is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma) + 2(hl \cos \beta) + 2(kl \cos \alpha) ) }}

Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral system, all a, b, c are equal, so a = b = c. And all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees in this case.

So substituting into the formula, since a = b = c, and all angles equal, the equation simplifies.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) + 2*(1*1 * cos(30°)) + 2*(1*1 * cos(30°)) + 2*(1*1 * cos(30°)) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

The denominator becomes:

h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha

Since all three angles are 30 degrees, and a=b=c, so it becomes:

Denominator = 3 + 2[ cos(30) + cos(30) + cos(30) ]

Because hk is 1*1, same for all terms. So 3 terms of 2*cos(30), each multiplied by 1.

Wait, 2hk cos gamma is 2*1*1*cos(30), same for the others.

So 3 terms, each 2 * cos(30), so total denominator is 3 + 6 * cos(30).

Wait, no, wait:

Denominator = [1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2] + 2*(1*1 cos gamma) + 2*(1*1 cos beta) + 2*(1*1 cos alpha )

So that's 3 + 2cos(30) + 2cos(30) + 2cos(30) = 3 + 6 cos(30).

So yes, 3 + 6 * cos(30 degrees).

So let's compute that.

cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So denominator becomes 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So the square root of 8.196 is approximately sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

Wait, let me calculate more precisely.

Wait, 8.196. Let's see: 2.8 squared is 7.84. 2.85 squared is (2.85)^2 = 8.1225. 2.86^2 = 8.1796. 2.863^2 = let's see, 2.86^2 is 8.1796, 0.003^2 is small, but 2.863^2 is about 8.196. So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d = a / 2.863.

Wait, a is the interatomic distance, given as 10 Angstroms. So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ ?

Calculating 10 / 2.863: 2.863 * 3 is about 8.589, which is less than 10. 3.5 would be 2.863 *3.5=10.0205, which is just over 10.

Wait, perhaps exact calculation: 10 / 2.863.

Let me compute this:

2.863 * 3 = 8.589.

10 -8.589 = 1.411.

So 1.411 / 2.863 ≈ 0.4925.

So total is approx 3.4925 Angstroms.

Wait wait wait, that can't be right. Because the options are all around 9, 8, 9.5, 10. So 3.49 is way too small. Hmm, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait wait, hold on, I think I messed up the formula. Because I thought a is the interatomic distance, but in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameter is the edge length of the unit cell, but the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms. Wait, no, wait, no, in a crystal, the unit cell edge length a is related to the interatomic distance. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, but in a more complex structure it can be different.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corner, so interatomic distance is a√1, but for say, a face-centered cubic, the distance is a√2 / 2.

Wait, but in this question, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter a is different from the interatomic distance. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Oh no, because in the formula, a is the lattice parameter, not the interatomic distance. So perhaps I confused the two.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Let me think again.

In the question, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So the distance between atoms is 10 Angstrom. But the lattice parameter a for the unit cell is not necessarily the same as the interatomic distance. For example, in a simple cubic structure, a would be equal to the interatomic distance. But in a more complex structure, like BCC or FCC, the interatomic distance is a multiple of a.

Wait, so I'm not sure what the interatomic distance is in a rhombohedral structure. Hmm. Because in a rhombohedral system, each atom is at the corners of the rhombohedron. I think the interatomic distance would be the distance between two adjacent atoms, which in this case would be along the edge of the rhombohedron. So the interatomic distance is a, the lattice parameter.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because rhombohedral structures can have different coordination. Wait, but in the case of a simple rhombohedral structure, like a non-close-packed structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length. Because each atom is at each corner. So the distance between adjacent atoms is a.

But wait, the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So if that's the case, then a = 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. Because each atom is at the corner, and the edges are the same. So if a is 10 Angstrom, then the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me clarify.

In a simple cubic structure: each atom is at the corner. The interatomic distance (distance between nearest neighbors) is a√1, because each edge is a, and the diagonal is along the edge. Wait, no, in simple cubic, the nearest neighbors are along the cube edges, so the interatomic distance is a. So in that case, a is the interatomic distance.

Similarly, in a face-centered cubic structure, the nearest neighbors are along the face diagonals. So the interatomic distance is a√2 / 2 = a /√2. So a is larger than the interatomic distance.

Wait, so for the rhombohedral case, the interatomic distance is along the edge of the unit cell, so it's equal to a. So a is 10 Angstrom. Thus, in the formula I should use a=10.

Wait, but wait, that's what I thought earlier, but that led to d=3.49, which is not matching any of the options. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but something else. Let me think: in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corner of the rhombohedron. So the nearest neighbors are along the edges, so the interatomic distance is the same as a.

Wait, but maybe in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are not just at the corners. Hmm, no, the question describes a rhombohedral crystal, which implies a simple structure where each atom is at each corner. So the interatomic distance is a.

But then, if I proceed with a=10, I get d=3.49, which is nowhere near the options. So clearly, I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar spacing formula for a cubic system, but with angles. The general formula for a cubic system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

But for a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and α=β=γ=θ (let's say 30 degrees).

So substituting, we get:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos θ + 2hl cos θ + 2kl cos θ )

Which can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h + k + l)^2 - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) ? No, wait, that's not right.

Wait, expanding the denominator:

h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos θ + 2hl cos θ + 2kl cos θ.

Let me factor this expression.

Take h² + k² + l² as the first part, and the rest as 2 cos θ (hk + hl + kl).

So denominator = (h² + k² + l²) + 2 cos θ (hk + hl + kl)

So for h=k=l=1, denominator is 3 + 2 cos θ (3), since each term hk, hl, kl is 1.

Wait, because hk = 1*1=1, same for hl and kl. So 3 terms, each 1, so 3*(1) multiplied by 2 cos θ.

So denominator = 3 + 6 cos θ.

So with θ=30 degrees, cos θ=√3/2≈0.866.

So denominator is 3 + 6*(0.866) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is approx 2.863.

Thus, d = a / 2.863.

But wait, I thought a was 10 Angstrom, but that gives d≈3.49 Angstrom, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that a is the interatomic distance.

Alternatively, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, a is not the interatomic distance. Maybe the interatomic distance is a multiplied by something.

Hmm, wait another approach: perhaps the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure is given by a * sqrt( something ).

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, as each atom is at the corner. But in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms might be arranged in a way that the interatomic distance is related to a in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the edge, so a is the interatomic distance. So a=10, as given.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula from crystallography:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the edges.

So for (111), h=k=l=1, so denominator is 3 + 2*(3) * cos(30)

Which is 3 +6*(√3/2) =3 +3√3 ≈3+5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d= a / 2.863.

If a=10, d≈3.49. But the options are in 8-10 Angstrom. So that can't be. So perhaps I'm using the wrong a.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but the distance between the atoms along the edge of the unit cell, but perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell has a different a.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the structure, which is the same as a for a simple cubic, but for rhombohedral, perhaps each unit cell edge is longer.

Wait, maybe the interatomic distance is the same as the unit cell edge length, a. So a=10.

But that gives d=3.49, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but with all angles being 30 degrees, so alpha is 30.

Wait, that's what I used earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the interatomic distance.

Wait, no. Another thought: perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal lattice vector. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and it's actually the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Miller indices, but I think I'm correct with the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is instead:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, for rhombohedral, all angles are 30 degrees, so gamma=beta=alpha=30.

So denominator is 3 + 2[ (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) ) ] = 3 + 2*(3 * cos30) ) = 3 +6*(√3/2) =3 +3√3 ≈ 8.196.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the formula uses the unit cell edge length, which is not the same as the interatomic distance. For example, in a face-centered cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√2/2. So perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is a multiplied by some factor.

But without knowing the exact structure of the rhombohedral crystal, it's hard to say. The question says it's a rhombohedral crystal, so perhaps it's a simple rhombohedral structure, like a non-close-packed structure, so the interatomic distance is a. So a=10.

But that leads to d=3.49, which is not in the options. So perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the interplanar distance is the same as the interatomic distance. That can't be because the interplanar distance is for the (111) plane, which is a different spacing.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is inverted. Maybe it's a / d = ... ?

Wait, the formula is d = a / denominator.

So if the denominator is 2.863, and a is 10, then d=3.49.

But the options are all around 9, which is about 3 times larger.

Wait, wait a minute, perhaps the formula is actually d = (a) * sqrt(...). No, no, the formula is a divided by sqrt(...).

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal. Wait, maybe the formula is 1/d = sqrt( ... ) / a.

No, the formula is correct as d = a / sqrt( ... )

Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the angles. Wait, angles in a rhombohedral structure can be either acute or obtuse. Alpha is 30 degrees, which is acute. So the formula should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a but something else. For example, in a rhombohedral structure, with each atom at the corners, the interatomic distance is along the edge of the unit cell, which is a. So a=10.

Wait, but the options are 8.95, 9.08, 9.54, etc. So 3.49 is not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + ... something else.

Wait, another approach. The general formula for the interplanar distance in any crystal system is:

1/d² = (h²/l² + k²/m² + l²/n²) + ... something with the angles.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the different formulas. Alternatively, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because the metric tensor is symmetric.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice can be described using a single parameter, often the angle alpha.

The volume of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha ), but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which is what I used earlier.

So with a=10, and the denominator as sqrt(8.196)=2.863, d≈3.49.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the problem is not that a is the interatomic distance, but that the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure isn't the same as a.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell. Because in that case, a=10, but then d=3.49 as before, which still doesn't match.

Alternative approach: perhaps the question is using a different formula, such as the one for hexagonal systems, but no, rhombohedral is a cubic system.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula and it's 1/d = sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 ) / a² + ... )

No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Which is what I used. So that part seems correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe the interatomic distance given is not along the edge but along a diagonal. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance could be along a face or space diagonal.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, so the interatomic distance is a. But perhaps in this rhombohedral structure, the atoms are arranged such that the nearest neighbor distance is not along the edge but along a different direction, like a face or space diagonal.

Wait, but rhombohedral structures are generally close to cubic. For example, in a hexagonal close-packed structure, the nearest neighbors are along the face diagonals, but that's a hexagonal system.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a * something.

Wait, if the interatomic distance is along the edge, then a is 10. If it's along a face diagonal, then the distance would be a * sqrt(2) * cos(theta/2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length divided by the square root of 3, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's think of the interplanar distance formula in terms of the reciprocal basis vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the reciprocal lattice vectors and find the magnitude.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think about this.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors a, b, c are all equal in length (a = b = c), and the angles between them are all equal (alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees).

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a^2) (a1 + a2 cos α + a3 cos β)
Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula for reciprocal vectors.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the interplanar distance using the formula I have, assuming a is the edge length.

Wait, but according to the options, the interplanar distance is around 9. So perhaps a is not 10, but another value.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between the atoms, which is a√(3) or something else, and a is different.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the problem assumes that a is the interatomic distance. But if that leads to a d of about 3.49, which is not in the options, then perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the lattice parameter a as being different from the interatomic distance.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a.

In a face-centered cubic, the interatomic distance is a√2/2.

In a body-centered cubic, it's a√3/3.

But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance could be a multiplied by some factor. But I'm not sure what that factor is, because rhombohedral structures can have different types, like primitive or centered.

Wait, perhaps this is a simple rhombohedral (primitive) structure, so the interatomic distance is a. So a=10.

But that leads to d=3.49, which is not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is not along the edges but along the face diagonals or something else.

Wait, if the interatomic distance is along the face diagonal, then the edge length a would be 10 / sqrt(2) ≈7.07 Angstroms.

Wait, but then let's plug that into the formula.

So a=7.07.

Denominator is sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=7.07 / 2.863 ≈ 2.467 Angstroms. Still doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the space diagonal.

Space diagonal in a cube is a*sqrt(3). So if interatomic distance is a*sqrt(3), then a=10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.7735.

So a≈5.7735.

d=5.7735 / 2.863 ≈2.016 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for a rhombohedral interplanar distance.

Upon checking notes, the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Where α is the angle between the lattice vectors (30 degrees in this case).

So for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

Denominator: 3 + 2*(1+1+1) cos(30) =3 +6*(√3/2)=3 +3√3≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d= a / 2.863.

But a is the lattice parameter, which is the edge length of the unit cell.

But in the question, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. So what is a in terms of the interatomic distance?

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. So a=10.

But in a rhombohedral structure, if the structure is simple, then the interatomic distance is a. So a=10.

Which gives d=3.49, not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a multiplied by sin(alpha), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the bond length, which in a rhombohedral structure is a multiplied by the factor.

Hmm, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance can be calculated as a * sqrt( (sin α)^2 + (sin α)^2 + (sin α)^2 ), but that's getting into vector analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a * sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1 ) ) ?

No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should model the rhombohedral structure as a cube with each edge a, and each angle alpha between edges.

The vectors a, b, c are each of length a, and the angles between any two vectors is alpha=30 degrees.

So the distance between two adjacent atoms (i.e., along the edge) is a.

But if the interatomic distance is given as 10, then a=10.

Wait, but in that case, the interplanar distance d is 3.49 Angstrom, which doesn't match any option. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm missing a key point.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me think about the structure again.

In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, with a = b = c, and α = β = γ.

The (111) plane is one of the planes in the crystal.

The formula for the interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

So for (111), it's 3 + 6 cos(30°) in the denominator.

But perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute it again.

3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

Compute 3*sqrt(3)=5.19615. So 3+5.19615=8.19615.

sqrt(8.19615)= approx 2.863.

Thus, d= a/2.863.

If a=10, d=3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are all around 9, 8.95 etc.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the interplanar distance of the (100) plane, which would be a.

But the question is about (111), not (100).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses a different approach, such as the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/d) = sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) / a.

Wait, no, that can't be because then d would be smaller than a, but for (100), d=a, so that would require 1/d = 1/a, which would mean the equation would be correct, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the inverse, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm calculating the reciprocal. Let me think: if I have d=3.49, and the options are about 9, then 10/3.49≈2.867. Hmm, 2.867 is approximately sqrt(8.196).

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + ... )

Wait, but that would make d larger than a, which is not possible because in cubic systems, the interplanar distance is less than a for higher order planes.

Wait, no. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the (100) plane has d=a. The (111) plane has d=a/sqrt(3)= approx 5.77, which is less than a=10.

Wait, but in this question, the options are higher than a=10, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm back to square one.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interatomic distance is not a, but a multiplied by some factor.

Wait, in a body-centered cubic structure, a is the edge length, and the interatomic distance is a√3/4 * 4 = a√3/(something). Wait, perhaps it's a√3/√8, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a multiplied by sin(theta), where theta is 30 degrees.

Wait, if theta is 30 degrees, sin(30)=0.5, so a=20 would make the interatomic distance 10.

Wait, wait, wait, this might be the key.

Because if the angle alpha is 30 degrees, then perhaps the interatomic distance is a * sin(alpha).

So if the interatomic distance is 10, then a = 10 / sin(30) =10 / 0.5=20.

So a=20 Angstrom.

Then, d= a / sqrt(8.196) =20/2.863 ≈7.00 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a * sin(theta/2), but that would be even smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the vectors. The interatomic distance is between two adjacent atoms, which are at the ends of the vectors a and b. So the distance is |a - b|.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the vectors a and b have a length of a, and the angle between them is alpha=30 degrees.

So the distance between the atoms is the magnitude of (a - b).

Wait, that would be sqrt( a² + b² - 2ab cos alpha )

Because the distance between two vectors a and b is |a - b|=sqrt( |a|² + |b|² - 2 |a||b| cos theta )

Since a = b = a, this becomes sqrt( a² + a² - 2 a² cos 30 ) = a * sqrt(2 - 2 cos 30 )

So interatomic distance = a * sqrt( 2 (1 - cos 30) )

Given that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms.

So,

10 = a * sqrt( 2 (1 - cos 30) )

Compute 1 - cos30: cos30=√3/2≈0.8660. So 1 - 0.8660=0.13397.

So 2*(0.13397)=0.26794.

sqrt(0.26794)=0.5176.

So,

a = 10 / 0.5176 ≈19.33 Angstrom.

So a≈19.33 Angstroms.

Now, let's compute the interplanar distance d for (111):

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

Which is 19.33 / sqrt(8.196) ≈19.33 / 2.863 ≈6.758 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should try this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the length of the vector from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) in the unit cell. But that's the diagonal of the rhombohedron.

Wait, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes, which is not the same as the interatomic distance.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is given as the distance between nearest atoms, which could be along a different direction than the edge.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me proceed.

So, using the approach where the interatomic distance is the magnitude of (a - b), which is 10 = a * sqrt(2 - 2 cos30).

Compute a:

a = 10 / sqrt(2*(1 - cos30)) 

Compute denominator:

2*(1 - cos30) = 2*(1 - sqrt(3)/2)= 2 - sqrt(3) ≈ 2 - 1.732=0.268.

sqrt(0.268)=≈0.5176.

So a=10 /0.5176 ≈19.33 Angstrom.

Then, d= a / sqrt(8.196)=19.33/2.863 ≈6.758 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell, a=10.

Then, interplanar distance d=3.49 Ang.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula, such as for hexagonal systems. But no, the question is about rhombohedral, which is a cubic system.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in the formula is (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + ... ). But that would depend on the specific angles.

Wait, perhaps the formula has a negative sign for the cos terms.

Wait, no, the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

But if the angles are greater than 90 degrees, the cos would be negative, but in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute using a=10 directly and see which option it's closest to.

Wait, 3.49 is not matching any options. So perhaps the correct formula is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, but this would be different if the angles are <90 degrees.

Wait, let me try that.

So denominator =3 - 6*(0.866)=3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so sqrt can't be taken. So that can't be right.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²) (1/a²) (1 + 2 cos alpha + ... ).

Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Miller indices and the unit cell parameters to compute the interplanar distance.

Wait, the general formula for the interplanar distance for any crystal system is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/l_1²) + (k^2/l_2²) + (l^2/l_3²) + ... cross terms ... )

Wait, perhaps using the metric tensor. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

[ 1  cosα cosα cosα ]
[ cosα 1 cosα cosα ]
[ cosα cosα 1 ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's a matrix where the off-diagonal terms are cos alpha.

So the reciprocal of the metric tensor gives the interplanar distances.

Wait, the metric tensor (g) for a rhombohedral system is:

g = a² [ 1       cosα      cosα
          cosα    1         cosα
          cosα    cosα      1     ]

Then, the reciprocal metric tensor (g^-1) will have elements that can be used to compute d.

The interplanar distance d for (hkl) is given by:

d = (1/√(h² +k² + l² + 2hk cosα + 2hl cosα + 2kl cosα )) * a

Which brings us back to the same formula as before.

So for (111), it's a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30) ≈a/2.863.

But if a=10, d≈3.49.

But the options are around 9, so perhaps the correct a is 27.75, which when divided by 3 gives about 9.25, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a multiplied by sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + ... )

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach: the interplanar distance can be calculated as:

d = (a) * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα ) / (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα )

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) (1 + 2 cos alpha - ... ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's say the interatomic distance is a, so a=10.

Then, d=3.49, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I have to choose the closest.

Wait, the options are:

A) 9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05.

Hmm, maybe I've made a miscalculation in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Which in this case is:

d =10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(0.866))=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49.

But if I made a mistake in the formula and the denominator is (h² +k² + l²) minus 2*(hk cos gamma + ... ), that would give a negative denominator, which can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses a different sign convention for the angles.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2*(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Then denominator would be 3 -6*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So impossible.

Thus, perhaps I have to conclude that the correct answer is d≈3.49 Angstrom, but since it's not an option, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a for the (100) plane, but the (111) plane's interplanar distance is different.

But the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interatomic distance is not along the edges but along another direction. For example, if the interatomic distance is the distance between (000) and (111), which is a√(3 + 6 cos30).

Wait, that's a possibility, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the distance from (000) to (111) would be |a + b + c|.

Since a, b, c are vectors with length a and angles of 30 degrees between them.

So the distance is sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2ab cos(theta) + 2ac cos(theta) + 2bc cos(theta) )

Which is sqrt(3 a² + 6 a² cos30 )

= a sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)) 

= a sqrt(3 +3 sqrt(3) )

= a * sqrt(3 + 5.196) =a * sqrt(8.196)=a *2.863.

If the interatomic distance is 10, then:

10 = a *2.863 → a=10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But then, interplanar distance d for (111) is a / sqrt(8.196)=3.49 /2.863≈1.219 Angstrom, which is even smaller.

Hmm, that doesn't help either.

I think I'm stuck and have to go with the initial calculation, but since it's not matching, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ) )^{-1}.

Which is the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 9.08 Angstrom.

Wait, how? Let me compute 10 / (sqrt(8.196))=3.49, but perhaps I made a mistake and the formula uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, no, that would make d larger than a, which isn't possible for (111) plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is reciprocal. Let me compute 10 * sqrt(8.196) =10 *2.863≈28.63. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But that gives a negative denominator if alpha is 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

So denominator=3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so d would be imaginary. Not possible.

Thus, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on the formula I used is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about a.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between the atoms, which is along the edge, so a=10.

But then, perhaps the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the formula, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the square of the denominator.

Wait, d= a * sqrt( denominator )

Which would make d=10 *2.863≈28.63 Angstroms. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( denominator )^(-1).

Which would be d= a / sqrt(denominator ), which is what I did earlier.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is not present. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt(8.196) more accurately.

8.196 → let's compute it precisely.

2.86²=8.1796.

2.863²= (2.86 +0.003)^2=2.86² + 2*2.86*0.003 +0.003²=8.1796 +0.01716+0.000009=8.196769.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So 10 /2.863≈3.49.

But the options are around 9, which is approximately 3 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interatomic distance is the distance between (000) and (222), which would be 2a * sqrt(3 +6 cos30).

But if the interatomic distance is 10, then 2a * sqrt(8.196)=10 → a=10/(2*2.863)=10/5.726≈1.746.

Then, d= a / sqrt(8.196)=1.746/2.863≈0.61, which is even smaller.

This isn't helping. I think I'm going in circles.

Perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08, but I can't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

In that case, denominator=3 +6*(1 -0.866)=3 +6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)≈1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.129. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2 cos alpha instead of cos alpha.

Wait, let me think. Another possibility: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

Which would change the denominator.

So denominator =3 +6*(1 -0.866)=3 +6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.13. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, I think I must have made a mistake in my approach. Perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08, but I can't see how to reach it.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is d= a * sin(alpha) / sqrt( ... )

Wait, that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * cos(alpha) / sqrt( ... )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is 10, which is the lattice parameter a. So a=10.

But as before, d=3.49.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to use a different formula, such as:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) / (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which would give d=10 * sqrt(3) /8.196≈17.32/8.196≈2.113. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a * sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 )) / (sqrt( ... )) .

But I'm not making progress.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer based on the formula I used is approximately 3.49, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95, but I can't see how to get there.

Wait, maybe I should compute the reciprocal of 3.49, which is approx 0.286. But that's also not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula and the correct denominator is 3 - 6 cos30.

But that would be 3-5.196=-2.196, which is invalid. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + ... )) / (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 )

But that's not making sense.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches. I'll have to go with my initial calculation, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A)9.08, but I can't see how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)10.05, but that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the denominator is actually 3 -6 * cos(30) which is negative, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95, which is close to 10 * 0.895.

But without a clear path, I'm stuck.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}
\]

### Key Information:
- The crystal is rhombohedral, so \( a = b = c \) and \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \).
- The interatomic distance is given as \( 10 \, \text{Å} \).
- For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \).

### Step 1: Simplify the Denominator
The denominator becomes:
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)
\]
Substituting \( h = k = l = 1 \) and \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \):
\[
3 + 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866) = 3 + 6 \cdot 0.866 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( d \)
The interplanar distance is:
\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{8.196}}
\]
Here, \( a \) is the lattice parameter. Assuming \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) (since the interatomic distance is given as \( 10 \, \text{Å} \) and \( a \) is the edge length of the rhombohedron):
\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{8.196}} \approx \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with Options
The calculated \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options (\( 9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)). This discrepancy suggests either:
1. The interatomic distance is not equal to \( a \), and \( a \) must be recalculated based on the interatomic distance.
2. The formula or assumptions about the structure may need reevaluation.

### Recalculating \( a \) Based on Interatomic Distance
If the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors along the edge of the rhombohedron, then \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \). However, if the interatomic distance is along a different direction (e.g., a face or space diagonal), \( a \) would be larger. For example, if the interatomic distance is along the space diagonal, \( a \) would need to be recalculated using vector analysis.

### Final Consideration
Given the mismatch between the calculated \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) and the provided options, it is unclear how to reconcile the result with the given choices. However, based on the options and the assumption that \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \), the closest plausible answer is **A) 9.08 Å**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.

Answer: A
