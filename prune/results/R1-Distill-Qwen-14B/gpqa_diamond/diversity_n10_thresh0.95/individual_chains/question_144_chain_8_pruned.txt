Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's a really tiny distance.

Wait, I remember that for particles like this, the mean lifetime (which relates to the decay distance) is given by something involving their width. Oh right! The mean lifetime τ is related to the particle's width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. But I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Oh wait, the decay width Γ is related to the inverse of the lifetime. So Γ is the total decay rate, and τ is the mean lifetime, which is ħ divided by Γ.

Wait, but in what units? Because ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, right? So ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because GeV is a unit of energy, so when you have ħ in GeV·s, you can handle the units properly.

So first, let's get Γ in GeV. The given Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

Then, the mean lifetime τ is ħ / Γ_X. Plugging in the numbers, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is roughly about 20.56875. So τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, is that right? To double-check, 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 is 320 MeV. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is indeed around 20.57. So yes.

Now, the decay distance is the particle's speed multiplied by the lifetime. Because the distance d = v * τ.

But wait, what's the velocity v of the meson X? We have its energy E_X and mass m_X. We can use relativistic equations to find the velocity.

The energy E is related to mass and momentum. The relativistic energy formula is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So we can solve for momentum p.

E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. Let's plug these into the equation.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So (8 GeV)^2 = (p c)^2 + (1.2 GeV c²)^2 / c^2. Wait, no, wait, let's see. The units might be a bit tricky, but perhaps I can express everything in terms of GeV and c=1 units for simplicity? Because in particle physics, they often set c=1 to simplify equations.

So if c=1, then E² = p² + m². So E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², but when c=1, m is in GeV (since m c² is energy, so m in GeV/c² multiplied by c² (m²/s²) gives GeV).

Wait, maybe I should think of E in GeV, m in GeV/c², but then when c=1, E² = p² c² + m² c^4. Hmm, maybe it's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the velocity beta, which is v/c.

The formula for beta is sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2)). Since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v, so beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)). But when E is much larger than m, beta approaches 1. Let's plug in the numbers.

E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So m_X c² is 1.2 GeV, but E is 8 GeV, so E is larger than m. So we can compute beta as sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)). Let's compute that.

m^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV^2)
E^2 = 8^2 = 64 (GeV^2)
So 1 - (1.44/64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775
So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute this more accurately. The exact value:

1.44 / 64 = 0.0225. So 1-0.0225=0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887 as before.

So beta is about 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 * c. Since c is approximately 3e8 meters per second, then v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay distance d is v * τ. So let's compute that.

We have τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

d = v * τ ≈ (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = ?

Let me calculate the exponent first: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's compute that.

2.966 * 2 is 5.932, 2.966 * 0.056875 is about 0.168. So total is approximately 6.1. So 6.1e-16 meters?

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 2.966 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375. 0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's see:

2.056875 * 0.966. Let's compute 2 * 0.966 =1.932. 0.056875 *0.966≈0.0549. So total is approximately 1.932 +0.0549 =1.9869.

So 2.056875 *2.966 = (2 + 0.966) *2.056875 = 2*2.056875 + 0.966*2.056875 ≈4.11375 +1.9869 ≈6.10065.

So 6.10065e-16 meters. Wait, but none of the options are close to that. The options are 5e-15, 4e-15, etc. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the velocity? Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the mean decay length formula. I think the formula is d = c * τ * beta gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but wait, another formula I remember is d = (v * gamma) * tau. Or is it d = beta gamma c tau? Hmm. Let me think. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²) in natural units. Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

So then, beta gamma is (0.9887) * (6.6667) ≈ 6.571.

So d = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, but tau is ħ/(Gamma), which we computed as about 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So using tau = ħ / Γ, which is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ~2.056e-24 s, as before.

Then,
