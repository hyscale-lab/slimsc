Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let's read it carefully. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's lithium-6, right? Because lithium typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6.

Wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So the atomic number Z is 3, and the mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is ^6Li.

The task is to find the energy of RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The options are given in GeV, so I need to calculate the relativistic energy of this nucleus.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 divided by sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). 

So first, I need to compute gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me calculate that. 

v = 0.96c, so (v^2)/(c^2) = (0.96)^2. Let's compute that: 0.96 * 0.96. Hmm, 96 times 96 is 9216, so 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784). Let me see, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7. 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, 25/7 is exactly 3.57142857... So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the lithium-6 nucleus. Since it's a nucleus, I should consider its atomic mass. The mass of a nucleus is approximately A times the mass of a nucleon. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². But wait, for precise calculations, I might need the exact mass of ^6Li.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the energy to four decimal places, so I need to use accurate values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the atomic mass. The mass of ^6Li can be found in tables. Let me think; I don't remember the exact number. Alternatively, the problem might expect me to approximate the mass as 6 times the mass of a proton, but that's an approximation. But for accurate calculation, I think I need the exact mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to consider X as a nucleus, so its mass is the sum of the masses of its nucleons minus binding energy. But without exact data, maybe the problem expects a simpler approach.

Wait, another approach: The rest mass energy of the nucleus can be calculated using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of ^6Li is about 6.0139 g/mol (I remember that from some tables, but I'm not 100% sure). Wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So if the mass of ^6Li is, say, M u, then E_rest = M * 931.5 MeV.

Let me look up the mass of ^6Li. From memory, the atomic mass of ^6Li is about 6.0139 atomic mass units. Wait, wait. Actually, the exact value is approximately 6.0139 u. So M = 6.0139 u.

Wait, but no, that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons. Wait, but when considering a nucleus, you have to account for electrons. Hmm, but the nucleus itself is charge +3, so in its neutral state, it has 3 electrons. So the mass of the ^6Li atom is 6.0139 u, and the mass of the nucleus would be approximately 6.0139 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Each electron's mass is about 0.00054858 u. So three electrons would be 0.0016457 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.0139 - 0.0016457 = approximately 6.01225 u.

Wait, but wait: Alternatively, the mass of the nucleus can be found using the mass of the atom minus the electrons. So perhaps I should be precise here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to ignore the electrons, considering the nucleus as being composed of protons and neutrons only. Because for heavy ions, sometimes the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleus. But in this case, since it's a light nucleus, maybe it's better to compute it accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the nucleus's mass as simply 6 nucleons, each with a mass of about 938 MeV/c². But this would be an approximation, as the actual mass is less due to binding energy. However, for the purpose of this problem, maybe it's sufficient.

Wait, but no, because the actual rest mass is different. Let me think again. Let me see: the exact mass of ^6Li is needed.

I think I can compute it using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.0139 u. Then, the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. Each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. For ^6Li, which has 3 electrons, so 3 * 0.00054858 = 0.0016457 u.

So the nucleus mass is 6.0139 - 0.0016457 = 6.0122543 u.

So M = 6.0122543 u.

Now, converting u to kg: 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So M = 6.0122543 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Let me compute that:

6.0122543 * 1.6605390666e-27 kg = ?

Let me compute 6 * 1.660539e-27 = approx 9.963234e-27 kg.

0.0122543 * 1.660539e-27 = 0.0122543 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ 2.035e-29 kg.

So total M ≈ 9.963234e-27 + 2.035e-29 = approx 9.98358e-27 kg.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the mass in kilograms as 6.0122543 * 1.6605390666e-27.

So 6 * 1.6605390666e-27 = 9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.0122543 * 1.6605390666e-27 = ?

Compute 0.01 * 1.660539e-27 = 1.660539e-29 kg.

0.0022543 * 1.660539e-27 = ?

Let me compute 0.002 * 1.660539e-27 = 3.321078e-29 kg.

0.0002543 * 1.660539e-27 = approx 4.215e-30 kg.

So adding: 1.660539e-29 + 3.321078e-29 = 4.981617e-29 kg.

Plus 4.215e-30 kg: approx 5.4031e-29 kg.

So total M = 9.963234e-27 + 5.4031e-29 = 9.963234e-27 + 0.054031e-27 = approx 9.963234 + 0.054031 = 10.017265e-27 kg? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 5.4031e-29 is equal to 0.054031e-27. So 9.963234e-27 + 0.054031e-27 = 9.963234 + 0.054031 = 10.017265e-27 kg? Wait, that can't be right because 6.0122543 u is about 6 u, and 6 u is roughly 9.96e-27 kg. So adding about 0.05e-27 kg makes it around 9.9637e-27 kg. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should just compute 6.0122543 * 1.6605390666e-27.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the rest energy in MeV directly. Because the mass in u can be converted to MeV/c² by multiplying by 931.5 MeV/u.

So M = 6.0122543 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.0122543 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute that.

0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315 MeV.

0.0022543 * 931.5 ≈ approx 2.096 MeV.

So total is 5589 +9.315 +2.096 ≈ 5589 + 11.411= 5600.411 MeV.

Wait, but wait, 6.0122543 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.0122543 * 931.5 ≈ let me compute that more accurately.

Compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.0122543 * 931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.002 *931.5=1.863, 0.0002543 *931.5 ≈ 0.237. So adding 9.315 +1.863=11.178, plus 0.237=11.415.

So total M = 5589 + 11.415 = 5600.415 MeV. So about 5600.415 MeV, which is 5.600415 GeV.

Wait, because 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 5600.415 MeV is 5.600415 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should use a more precise value for the atomic mass of ^6Li. Let me think. Another approach: perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass) minus binding energy. But that's more complicated, and without exact values, it's hard. But since the problem gives options in GeV, perhaps the calculation expects me to use the approximate mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the mass as 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

But wait, when you have a nucleus, the actual rest mass is less than the sum of the individual nucleon masses because of binding energy. So the actual rest mass would be about 5.6 GeV, as I calculated earlier with the atomic mass.

So, E = gamma * m c².

Gamma is 3.5714, m c² is 5.6004 GeV.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.6004 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 * 5.6004.

First, 3 *5.6004=16.8012.

0.5714 *5.6004: 0.5 *5.6004=2.8002, 0.0714 *5.6004 ≈ 0.4015. So total for 0.5714 is 2.8002 +0.4015=3.2017.

So total E ≈16.8012 +3.2017=20.0029 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Compute 3.5714 *5.6004.

Let me do it step by step.

3.5714 *5.6004 = ?

Let me think of 3.5 *5.6 = 19.6.

But wait, 3.5714 is approximately 3.5714 and 5.6004 is 5.6004.

Alternatively, perhaps compute it as:

3.5714 *5.6004 = (3 + 0.5714) *5.6004 =3*5.6004 +0.5714*5.6004.

3 *5.6004 =16.8012.

0.5714 *5.6004: Let me compute this.

0.5 *5.6004 =2.8002.

0.0714 *5.6004: Let's compute 0.07 *5.6004 =0.392028; 0.0014 *5.6004=0.00784056. So 0.392028 +0.00784056≈0.39986856.

So 0.5714 *5.6004 ≈ 2.8002 +0.39986856=3.20006856.

So total E ≈16.8012 +3.20006856 =20.00126856 GeV.

Wait, but according to the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, but my approximate calculation is around 20 GeV. So why am I getting approximately 20 GeV, but none of the options exactly match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the mass of the ^6Li nucleus.

Wait, let me recheck.

Earlier, I used the atomic mass of ^6Li as 6.0139 u, and then subtracted the mass of 3 electrons, which is about 0.0016457 u, giving 6.0122543 u.

But perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the nucleus is ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is a nucleon, each neutron is a nucleon. So the mass can be approximated as 6 * 938 MeV/c², but that would ignore binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps the actual mass is less.

Wait, but earlier I computed the rest energy as approximately 5.6 GeV. So perhaps using that, and gamma as 3.5714, the energy comes to about 20 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close to the 20.001 GeV I calculated. Hmm, but that's about 0.13 GeV higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more accurate value for the mass of ^6Li.

Looking up, the exact atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.013913 u (I think I've seen this value before). So M = 6.013913 u (atomic mass) minus 3*(electron mass).

Electron mass is about 0.0005485799 u each.

3 * 0.0005485799 = 0.0016457397 u.

So the nucleus mass is 6.013913 - 0.0016457397 = 6.01226726 u.

So M =6.01226726 u.

Now, converting to MeV: 6.01226726 u * 931.494 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute that accurately.

6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.01226726 *931.494 = ?

Compute 0.01*931.494=9.31494.

0.002*931.494=1.862988.

0.00026726 *931.494 ≈ let's compute:

0.0002 *931.494 = 0.1862988.

0.00006726 *931.494 ≈ let's compute 0.00006 *931.494=55.88964e-3=0.05588964. 0.00000726*931.494≈6.77 GeV? Wait no, 0.00000726 *931.494= approx 0.00678. So total for 0.00006726 is 0.05588964 +0.00678≈0.06267.

So 0.0002 *931.494 =0.1862988.

0.00006726 *931.494≈0.06267.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 0.00026726 *931.494:

0.0002 *931.494=0.1862988.

0.00006 *931.494=0.05588964.

0.00000726 *931.494≈0.006778.

So summing: 0.1862988 +0.05588964=0.24218844 +0.006778=0.24896644.

So 0.00026726 *931.494 ≈0.248966 MeV.

So adding everything:

9.31494 (from 0.01) +1.862988 (from 0.002) +0.248966 (from 0.00026726) = 11.426904 MeV.

So total M =5588.964 +11.426904=5600.3909 MeV.

Which is 5.6003909 GeV.

Ok, so the rest energy is approximately 5.6003909 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.6003909 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6003909.

Compute 3 *5.6003909=16.8011727.

0.57142857 *5.6003909.

Compute 0.5 *5.6003909=2.80019545.

0.07142857 *5.6003909.

Let me compute 0.07 *5.6003909=0.392027363.

0.00142857 *5.6003909≈0.007999999.

So summing 0.392027363 +0.007999999≈0.400027362.

So 0.57142857 *5.6003909 ≈2.80019545 +0.400027362=3.20022281.

So total E=16.8011727 +3.20022281=20.00139551 GeV.

So approximately 20.0014 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of gamma?

Wait, let me recheck gamma. v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 ≈3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

So why is my calculation leading me to approximately 20.0014 GeV, but the options don't have exactly that. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.13 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider the nucleus as moving with kinetic energy, but no, the question says the energy is the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma value.

Wait, because 0.96 is 24/25. So v=24c/25.

Then v² = (24/25)^2 c^2 = (576/625)c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 576/625 = (625 -576)/625 =49/625.

So sqrt(49/625) =7/25=0.28, as before.

So gamma is 25/7=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should recheck the mass calculation again.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the ^6Li nucleus is calculated differently. Maybe I should use the exact atomic mass including electrons, but that's the mass of the atom. But the nucleus is moving, so its rest mass is the mass of the atom minus the electrons' mass. Alternatively, perhaps I should not subtract the electrons' mass because the nucleus is a charged particle, but that's not right. The nucleus has a charge, but the mass includes the electrons when considering the neutral atom.

Wait, perhaps I should use the mass of the nucleus as the atomic mass minus the electrons, but maybe I should use the exact value. Let me look up the exact mass of ^6Li.

I think the exact atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.01391363 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.01391363 u minus 3 * 0.0005485799 u (each electron's mass).

3 *0.0005485799=0.0016457397 u.

So nucleus mass =6.01391363 -0.0016457397=6.01226789 u.

Now, converting that to GeV:

6.01226789 u * 931.494 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01226789 *931.494 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.002 *931.494=1.862988.

0.00026789 *931.494 = let's compute:

0.0002 *931.494=0.1862988.

0.00006789 *931.494 ≈ (0.06789e-4) *931.494 ≈ approx 0.06789 *931.494 * 1e-4.

Wait, 0.00006789 *931.494.

Compute 0.00006 *931.494=55.88964e-3=0.05588964.

0.00000789 *931.494 ≈ approx 7.89e-6 *931.494=approx 0.007
