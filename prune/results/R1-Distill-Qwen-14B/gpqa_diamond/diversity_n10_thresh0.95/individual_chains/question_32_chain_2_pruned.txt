Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit rusty on the specifics. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light. Oh wait, nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. So, the isotope must be Lithium-6, right? Because Li normally has 3 protons, and adding 3 neutrons makes the mass number 6 (3+3=6). So, X is ^6Li.

I need to find the energy of the collider. I think this involves relativistic mechanics because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c is pretty fast). So, I should probably use the relativistic energy equations.

First, I recall that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, because v is 0.96c, so plugging that in.

But wait, the nucleus is a heavy ion. So it's not a single proton; it's a collection of nucleons. The mass of the ion would be the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons. But wait, in reality, the mass of a nucleus isn't just the sum of its nucleons due to binding energy. But maybe for this problem, since we're dealing with a heavy ion, we can approximate the mass using the rest mass of the ion.

So I think I should calculate the relativistic gamma factor for v=0.96c, then multiply by the rest mass energy of the ^6Li nucleus to get the total energy. Since the collider accelerates ions to a certain energy, that's probably the total energy each ion has.

But wait, wait. The problem is about the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high energies. The energy per ion would be the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy, but in particle physics, sometimes people refer to the kinetic energy alone as the beam energy. Hmm, no, wait. In particle physics, the total energy includes rest mass. So when they say the energy of the collider, it's the total relativistic energy.

Oh, but wait, the problem says the speed is 0.96c. So we can calculate gamma, then multiply by the rest mass energy to get the total energy.

So the steps would be:

1. Find the rest mass of ^6Li.
2. Calculate gamma for v=0.96c.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy.

But wait, how do I find the rest mass of ^6Li? I think I can approximate it based on the number of protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Let me double-check: protons are about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutrons are 939.565 MeV/c². Approximately, both are around 938.5 MeV/c². So for ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be (3 + 3) * average mass per nucleon.

Wait, but wait a minute. The actual mass of ^6Li is less than the sum because of the binding energy. Because when nucleons come together, they form a nucleus with a mass slightly less due to the mass defect. So I can't just sum the individual masses. But in that case, how do I get the rest mass of ^6Li?

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass number A as an approximation for the mass in terms of nucleons. Wait, but to get the actual rest mass of ^6Li, I need to look it up. Hmm, but since this is a problem, perhaps they provide the mass or assume a certain value.

Wait, the problem didn't provide the mass of the nucleus, so perhaps I'm supposed to look it up or use an approximate value. Alternatively, maybe the mass is given in some standard table.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the mass using the average mass per nucleon and then subtract the binding energy. But I don't think I have the binding energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton plus the mass of a neutron multiplied by the appropriate numbers, regardless of the actual binding energy. Or maybe it's just a rough approximation.

Wait, but let me think: the rest mass of ^6Li is approximately 6 * m_nucleon, but slightly less because of the binding energy. But without knowing the exact value, perhaps the problem assumes that we can use the sum of the individual masses? Or perhaps they give a way to calculate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact mass. Let me try to remember: The mass of a ^6Li nucleus is approximately 6 * 1.0087 (since each nucleon is about 1.0087 atomic mass units). Wait, no, each nucleon is about 1.007276 (proton) and 1.008665 (neutron) in atomic mass units (amu). So for ^6Li, 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 amu. But the actual mass of ^6Li is less because of binding energy. The exact mass is about 6.0160 amu.

Wait, I think the exact mass of ^6Li is about 6.0160 amu. Let me check: yes, that's correct. The atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.0160 amu.

So, the rest mass energy of ^6Li is 6.0160 amu multiplied by 931.5 MeV/amu, since 1 amu is about 931.5 MeV/c².

Calculating that: 6.0160 * 931.5 = let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.0160 * 931.5 = approx 14.904.

So total is 5589 + 14.904 = 5603.904 MeV. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 6.0160 is about 6, but 6 * 931.5 is 5589, but 6.0160 is 6 + 0.0160, so 0.0160 * 931.5 is indeed about 14.9.

So 5589 + 14.9 ≈ 5603.9 MeV. So about 5603.9 MeV, which is 5.6039 GeV.

Wait, but that's a lot of GeV for a nucleus. Wait, no. Wait, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 5603.9 MeV is 5.6039 GeV. So the rest mass energy is about 5.604 GeV.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up units. Let me make sure: 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², so multiplying 6.0160 amu by 931.5 MeV/amu gives the rest energy in MeV.

So 6.0160 * 931.5 ≈ let me calculate exactly:

6.0160 * 900 = 5,414.4 MeV.

6.0160 * 31.5 = 6.0160 *30 is 180.48, 6.0160 *1.5 =9.024. So total 180.48 +9.024 = 189.504.

So total is 5,414.4 + 189.504 = 5,603.904 MeV, which is 5.6039 GeV.

So the rest mass energy of the ^6Li nucleus is approximately 5.6039 GeV.

Now, the speed is 0.96c. So we need to compute gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(784e-4) = 0.28. Because 0.28² is 0.0784.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/0.28 is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

Total energy E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.6039 GeV.

Calculating that:

Let me compute 3 * 5.6039 = 16.8117.

0.5714 *5.6039 ≈ ?

0.5 *5.6039 = 2.80195.

0.0714 *5.6039 ≈ 0.4023.

So approximate 2.80195 + 0.4023 ≈ 3.20425.

So total E ≈ 16.8117 + 3.20425 = 20.01595 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.016 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and D is 21.419. Hmm. My calculation is about 20.016, which is close to option C but a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma. Let me recheck.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = 0.9216.

1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, yes. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But let me compute it more precisely. 0.28 is exactly 7/25. So 25/7 is about 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857.

Now, 3.57142857 * 5.6039 GeV.

Let me compute 5.6039 * 3.5714.

Breaking it down:

5 * 3.5714 = 17.857.

0.6039 * 3.5714 ≈ let's see:

0.6 *3.5714 = 2.14284.

0.0039 *3.5714 ≈ approx 0.01393.

So 2.14284 + 0.01393 ≈ 2.15677.

Total E ≈ 17.857 + 2.15677 = 19.  17.857 + 2.15677 is 20.
