Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with optics and relativity. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm. Let me read it again. So, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, so the light is moving through the glass, and the glass is itself moving with velocity v. The light's direction is the same as the glass's motion. So, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. I'm a bit confused about the setup.

I remember that when dealing with velocities in different frames, especially involving light, relativity comes into play. But wait, this is about the speed of light in a medium, which is a bit different. Oh, right, the speed of light in a medium isn't exactly c; it's c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, the speed of light in the glass is c/n. But here, the glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So, the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. How does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, let me think. When you're in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But the lab frame sees the glass moving. So, perhaps we need to use the velocity addition formula from relativity. Oh, right, because the glass is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame might be different according to the velocity addition formula.

But wait, the velocity addition formula applies when moving from one inertial frame to another. So, let's say the glass's frame is moving at velocity u (which is v) relative to the lab frame. In the glass's frame, the speed of light is c/n. So, how do we transform that speed into the lab frame?

The velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity in the glass frame, and u' is the velocity in the lab frame. Wait, but wait, u is the speed of the light in the glass's frame. So, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. But wait, hold on, the direction matters. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, no, the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at velocity u = c/n (since it's moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity). So when the glass is moving at v relative to the lab, what is the lab's measurement of the light's speed?

Wait, but I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving in the +x direction, and the light in the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light's velocity is u = c/n towards the same direction as v. Then, using the velocity addition formula, the lab's frame would see the light's speed as u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Wait, but that would be if the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab, and the light's speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n (same direction). So substituting u = c/n.

Wait, but c is the speed of light in vacuum. Hold on a second, because the glass's refractive index is n, so the speed of light in the glass is c/n. So u is c/n. So, substituting into the velocity addition formula, we get u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + ( (c v)/(n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So the denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c )

So u' becomes: ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( (n c + v )/(n c) )

Wait, let's compute this. The numerator is (c + n v)/n. The denominator is [ (n c + v ) ] / (n c ) )

So dividing the two, it's [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel: (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but let's factor numerator and denominator. Let me write it as:

u' = [c (c + n v)] / [n c + v ]

Hmm, can we factor this further? Let's see:

Wait, the denominator is n c + v. The numerator is c (c + n v) = c^2 + c n v.

Wait, maybe factor out c from the denominator: c (n) + v = c n + v.

Is there a way to factor this? Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the sign. Let me think again. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So both v and u are in the same direction. So when we use the velocity addition formula, adding velocities, the signs are positive.

Wait, let me get back. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the lab frame. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving at velocity v. So the relative speed between the light and the glass is c/n, but in the same direction.

Wait, but that's the same as the earlier approach. So using the velocity addition formula correctly.

Wait, wait, let me try to compute the actual expression again.

u' = [ (u + v) ] / [ 1 + (u v) / c² ]

Where u is c/n as measured in the glass (the rest frame of the glass), and v is the velocity of the glass relative to lab.

So u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

1 + ( (c v) / (n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, denominator is (n c + v)/(n c) ?

Wait, let me compute denominator: 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v ) / (n c )

So denominator is (n c + v ) / (n c )

So u' is [ (c + n v)/n ] ÷ [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is the same as [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel: (c + n v ) * c / (n c + v )

So that becomes [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, can I factor the denominator as (n c + v) = n (c) + v. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator differently. Let me see.

Wait, numerator: c (c + n v) = c^2 + c n v

Denominator: n c + v.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out c from the denominator. Let me write denominator as c (n) + v. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps express numerator in terms of denominator. Let's see: numerator is c^2 + c n v = c (c + n v )

Wait, but maybe I can factor c in the denominator: denominator is c (n) + v = c (n) + v. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps factor n out from denominator: n c + v = n (c) + v. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe it's better to see the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Option B is 1,

Option C is (1 + n v )/(n - v )

Option D is (1 -n v )/(n +v )

Wait, but the speed I'm computing is [c (c +n v)] / [n c +v ].

But wait, c is the speed of light, but in the formula above, the speed comes out to be in terms of (c (c +n v )) over (n c + v).

But in the options, the expressions are in terms of 1 instead of c. Because the problem states "Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1." So c=1 here.

Ah, right, so c=1. So, substituting c=1:

u' = (1 * (1 + n v)) / (n *1 + v )

So u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second, I thought in the lab frame the speed of light should always be c, but that's only in vacuum. In a medium, it's different, but according to the problem, the glass is moving. Oh wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in vacuum is c regardless of the frame. But in this problem, the light is in glass, so it's not in a vacuum. So, the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab frame is not c, but depends on the velocity of the glass.

Wait, but I thought the speed of light in a medium is always c/n regardless of the medium's motion. But that's the Galilean view, which doesn't hold in relativity. So in reality, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the lab frame would be as calculated, which is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), when c=1.

So according to the options, option A is (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which matches our calculation.

But wait, let me think again. Is there any other approach?

Another approach: The speed of light in glass is v_light = c/n. But when the glass is moving at velocity v, the observed speed in the lab would be the vector sum, adjusted for relativity.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of light in the glass, but considering the direction. But wait, no, because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly.

Wait, but earlier I did use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which gave me option A.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we consider the following:

1. **Speed of Light in Glass**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is given by \( v_{\text{light, glass}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass, and \( c = 1 \) (as specified in the problem).

2. **Relative Motion of the Glass**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame.

3. **Substitute \( c = 1 \)**: Since \( c = 1 \), the formula simplifies to:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

4. **Simplify the Expression**: Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:
   \[
   u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

5. **Match with Options**: The derived expression \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches **Option A**.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

Answer: A
