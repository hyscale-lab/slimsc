Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with something labeled A, and the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step. I think I need to figure out what each reaction involves.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so it's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile source, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition? Or perhaps a substitution?

Wait, but ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. The nucleophile (CN-) would attack the carbonyl carbon. The mechanism would involve the formation of an enol or enolate, but wait, maybe it's more straightforward. Alternatively, since NaCN is a source of CN-, in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe it's undergoing a condensation reaction?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the addition of cyanide to the ketone. So the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. The product is a cyanohydrin. Right, a cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with a nitrile under acidic conditions. So the product would have the structure where the CN group is added to the carbonyl, and an -OH group is added as well. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN and OH groups would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me check the product name: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The formula would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, wait. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure.

Butane is four carbons. The nitrile is at the end. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but for 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, the structure would be: the nitrile is on carbon 1, then carbon 2 has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So:

CH2-C(CN)(OH)(CH3). Wait, no, maybe it's more like (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Or maybe I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2CH-C(OH)-CN? Hmm, not quite. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be: the nitrile is on the first carbon. The second carbon has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So the structure is CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN. Wait, that might be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile, but the product is 2-hydroxy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2CN with a hydroxyl and methyl on the same carbon. Wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile on the fourth, I think. Wait, no, butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So the nitrile is on the fourth carbon. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, so the nitrile is on carbon 4, the OH and methyl are on carbon 2.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction. The reaction is between a ketone (butan-2-one) and NaCN. So the ketone is (CH3)2CO. When you add NaCN, which is a source of CN-, in the presence of an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A and B for reagent A), the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. The oxygen becomes O- and then picks up a proton, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

The product of the cyanohydrin formation would have the structure where the ketone's carbonyl group is replaced by a hydroxyl and a cyanide group attached to the same carbon. So for butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but how many carbons is that? Let me see: (CH3)2C(OH)CN is 3 carbons from the ketone plus the nitrile group—so perhaps it's 3-pentanenitr... Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile at the end. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure: CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? Wait, but that would be four carbons, but the nitrile is on carbon 4, so the numbering would be:

1: CH2-

2: C(OH)(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: CN.

Wait, but that would make the structure CH2-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN. Hmm, but then the formula would be C5H9NO2? Wait, but the original ketone is (CH3)2CO (C3H6O), and NaCN is adding a CN group (C1N1). So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is C4H7NO2. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be C5H9NO2, I think. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed by adding the CN to the ketone's carbonyl, so replacing the O with CN and OH. So the product would have the same number of carbons as the ketone. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That's four carbons: the central C connected to two CH3, an OH, and a CN. So the formula would be C4H7NO2. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is butanenitrile (four carbons) with substituents at the second carbon. So perhaps the product is (CH2CH2) where the second carbon has OH and methyl, and the fourth is CN. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but I think the key is that the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin.

So the first reaction uses NaCN and an acid catalyst. So reagent A is an acid catalyst, like H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which is sodium bisulfate. Hmm, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, the first reaction would require an acid catalyst. So NaHSO3 could act as an acid catalyst because HSO3^- is a weak acid. So perhaps both H3O+ (which is strong acid) and NaHSO3 (which can provide H+) could act as catalysts.

But for the formation of the cyanohydrin, the typical conditions are using an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a nitrile group that's been converted to a carboxylic acid group.

How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? One common method is hydrolysis. Under acidic or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, the nitrile can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid by using H2O and an acid catalyst.

Wait, but what reagents are involved here? The second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. So perhaps the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of an acid (like H3O+ or another acid) to form the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but looking at the problem, the second reaction's reagent B is H2O. So if B is H2O, then what's the catalyst? Because usually, nitrile hydrolysis requires an acid or base catalyst. For example, in acidic conditions, H2O with H3O+ or H2SO4, or in basic conditions with NaOH and H2O.

So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. The starting material is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's a hydrolysis.

So, under what conditions does nitrile hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid? Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, you can use H2O with H3O+ or another acid. Alternatively, in basic conditions, you might need a strong base, but then you might get a sodium carboxylate, which would need to be acidified to get the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the product here is the carboxylic acid. So if the reaction is using H2O as B and another reagent, perhaps the other reagent is an acid.

Looking at the second part, the reagent B is H2O, and the other reagent is part of the options. So for the second reaction, the nitrile is in a molecule that also has a hydroxyl group (2-hydroxy), so perhaps the nitrile is at the end and can hydrolyze under certain conditions.

Wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is: the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to a phenyl group (4-benzylphenyl), a hydroxyl group, and another carbon chain ending in a nitrile.

Wait, but more accurately, it's butanenitrile with substituents. So the carbon chain is four carbons, with the nitrile on the fourth carbon. The second carbon has the hydroxyl and the phenyl group.

So the reaction is converting the nitrile group (CN) to a carboxylic acid (COOH). How is that done? One way is hydrolysis under acidic conditions. For example, using H3O+ as a catalyst, or H2SO4.

Alternatively, in the presence of a base, like aqueous NaOH, but that would form a carboxylate, not the acid, so you'd need to acidify afterward.

Looking at the options for reagent B, which is the reagent used in the second reaction. The options give B as HCl (option A) or B as H2O with another reagent (like in option D, B is CH3COOH). Wait, no, the options are for reagents A and B. Let me clarify.

The options give four options, each assigning A and B. For example, option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Hmm, perhaps B is an acid, because in the second reaction, H2O is used with an acid to hydrolyze the nitrile.

Wait, the second reaction is:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So B is H2O, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the problem states that the second reaction uses B, which is H2O. Wait, looking back: the second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So B is H2O, but wait, that can't be right because H2O alone wouldn't cause hydrolysis. So perhaps reagent B is an acid or a base. Wait, perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, the question says: '2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...' So reagent B is H2O, but that's not enough. Because nitrile hydrolysis requires more than just water—it needs a catalyst. So perhaps the reagent is H2O with an acid, like H3O+.

But in the options, each option assigns A and B. So for the first reaction, we have reagent A, and for the second, reagent B. So for the second reaction, reagent B is H2O, but perhaps the reaction is done in the presence of an acid or another catalyst.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

For the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which suggests that it's formed by the addition of CN- to the ketone under acidic conditions. So reagent A must be an acid (like H3O+ or H2SO4 or NaHSO3, which can donate H+).

For the second reaction, the nitrile group is being converted to a carboxylic acid. That usually requires hydrolysis with either strong acid or strong base. But the product is a carboxylic acid, so likely it's done under acidic conditions. So the reagent for the second reaction would be H2O with an acid catalyst.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl. But wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is H2O and B. So perhaps the setup is that in the second reaction, H2O is used in the presence of B (HCl or another acid). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is the acid.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again.

The second reaction is written as:

[compound] + B (H2O) → [compound]

Wait, perhaps the reagent is H2O, and B is something else. Wait, that can't be right. The way it's written, B is H2O. Wait, no, perhaps the way the question is written, the reagent B is H2O. So the second reaction uses H2O as the reagent, and perhaps another reagent. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent B is the acid or base that facilitates the hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is treated with H2O in the presence of an acid. So reagent B is H2O, and the other component is an acid.

Looking at the options, for the second reaction, the options assign B as either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written that the second reaction uses B as H2O. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, no, the problem says:

"2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid."

So B is H2O. So the second reaction uses H2O as the reagent B. That seems odd because H2O alone wouldn't cause the hydrolysis. But perhaps in the context of the options, reagent B is H2O, and another reagent (like an acid) is present. Wait, but the options are only assigning A and B, which are reagents for the two reactions.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction uses reagent A, and the second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. But that wouldn't make sense because H2O alone isn't enough for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. So perhaps the reaction is done in an acidic aqueous solution, where B is H2O and perhaps HCl (as an acid catalyst) is used.

So, putting it together:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. A is the catalyst, probably an acid like H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Second reaction: nitrile compound + B (H2O) → carboxylic acid. So B is H2O, but the reaction also needs an acid catalyst, so perhaps B is H2O and another reagent is added, like an acid. But looking at the options, the second reaction's reagent is B, which is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, no, in the options, the second reaction uses B, which is H2O, as the reagent. So perhaps the reagent B is H2O and the acid is provided by another component.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction uses H2O as the solvent and the acid is the other component. So the reagent is the acid—so reagent B in the options is the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is using H2O and an acid. But in the problem statement, the reagent for the second reaction is B, which is H2O. So perhaps the problem is that the second reaction uses H2O as the solvent, and another reagent is present (like an acid) which is part of reagent B. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is done under basic conditions. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under strong acidic or basic conditions. Let's think: if the nitrile is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions, you get the carboxylic acid. If under basic, you get the carboxylate, which then needs to be acidified.

In the options, the second reaction's B is either HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid, which is weak acid) or HCl (strong acid). Alternatively, if B is HCl, the reaction would proceed under acidic conditions, producing the carboxylic acid. But wait, if B is HCl, then perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis in HCl.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about each option.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

So first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. That makes sense.

Second reaction uses HCl as B. So the nitrile is hydrolyzed in the presence of HCl. But wait, if B is HCl, then the reagent is HCl, not H2O. Hmm, but the question says that the second reaction uses B as H2O. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, the second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. So perhaps the options are assigning B as H2O. Wait, but the options don't have B as H2O. Let me recheck the options.

Options:

A) A = H3O+; B = HCl.

B) A = H3O+; B = CH3COOH.

C) A = NaHSO3; B = HCl.

D) A = NaHSO3; B = CH3COOH.

Wait, the problem says that in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm reading it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses B as H2O, but the options are giving B as HCl or CH3COOH, which would be the acid for the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction uses H2O and the acid. So reagent B is the acid, and the solvent is H2O.

Wait, but the problem says that in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So perhaps H2O is the solvent, and the acid is part of the reagent B. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is not just using H2O but is using H2O along with an acid. So in the options, reagent B is the acid.

But if the second reaction uses H2O as the reagent, and the acid is part of B, then the options may not match. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should focus on the reaction types.

The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which requires an acid catalyst. So options A and B have A as H3O+, which is a strong acid. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid (since HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+). So H3O+ would be a stronger acid catalyst, which may be better for the reaction.

The second reaction is converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. For that, in acidic conditions, you can use H2O (as the solvent) with an acid catalyst, like HCl or H3O+.

Looking at the options, if the first reaction uses H3O+ (A is H3O+), which is a strong acid, that would facilitate the cyanohydrin formation. For the second reaction, if B is HCl (option A), then the nitrile would hydrolyze in HCl (acidic conditions) to form the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if B is acetic acid (CH3COOH), that's a weak acid. Would that be sufficient for the hydrolysis?

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid under acidic conditions usually requires a strong acid, like HCl. Using a weak acid like acetic acid might not be strong enough to hydrolyze the nitrile efficiently. So perhaps reagent B is HCl.

Looking back at the options, option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl. That would fit both reactions.

So first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → forms the cyanohydrin.

Second reaction: nitrile + HCl (as reagent B) + H2O → hydrolyzes to carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is HCl, and the solvent is H2O. So the conditions would be acidic hydrolysis.

But wait, in the problem statement, the second reaction is written as the compound plus B (H2O) → product. So perhaps the problem is that B is H2O, but the acid is part of the reaction conditions. I'm a bit confused about that part.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction uses H2O and another reagent, like an acid. So in the options, B is the acid (HCl or CH3COOH), and H2O is the solvent.

So if B is HCl, then the reaction is hydrolysis in HCl, which is acidic conditions, leading to the carboxylic acid.

Therefore, the correct reagents would be:

First reaction: A is H3O+ (acid catalyst).

Second reaction: B is HCl (acid catalyst for hydrolysis).

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So the answer would be option A.


The question involves determining the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **First Reaction**:  
   The reaction involves butan-2-one (a ketone) reacting with NaCN (a source of CN⁻) in the presence of reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where CN⁻ attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction to proceed, an acid catalyst is required. Among the options, reagent A as H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) or NaHSO₃ (a weaker acid) can act as the catalyst. However, H₃O⁺ is more effective for this type of reaction.

2. **Second Reaction**:  
   The reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (a nitrile compound) reacting with reagent B (H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst is typically required. Among the options, reagent B as HCl (a strong acid) or CH₃COOH (a weak acid) can facilitate the reaction. However, HCl is more effective for hydrolyzing nitriles to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is a strong acid catalyst for the first reaction, facilitating cyanohydrin formation.  
  - HCl is a strong acid catalyst for the second reaction, facilitating nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.  
  - This option is consistent with both reactions.

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction.  
  - CH₃COOH (a weak acid) may not be strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid in the second reaction.  
  - This option is less favorable.

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ (a weaker acid) is less effective than H₃O⁺ for the first reaction.  
  - HCl is suitable for the second reaction.  
  - This option is less favorable.

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is less effective than H₃O⁺ for the first reaction.  
  - CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is less effective than HCl for the second reaction.  
  - This option is the least favorable.

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents for the given reactions are **A = H₃O⁺** for the first reaction and **B = HCl** for the second reaction. These reagents ensure efficient catalysis for both reactions.

**Answer: A**
