Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and depending on the point, the pH changes. Let me think through this step by step.

So, first, the problem: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the right one.

Let me start by understanding what the initial solution looks like after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, CH3COOH. When we mix it with water, we're effectively diluting it. So the initial concentration will change.

The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. The initial concentration of acetic acid before dilution is 0.05 M. After adding equal volumes, the concentration halves because concentration is moles/volume. So the new concentration is 0.025 M. Let me check that: moles before = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 0.02 L more water, the volume is 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Next, when we titrate with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. At 25% titration, we've neutralized a quarter of the acetic acid. Wait, how much is that?

The moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So 25% titration means 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have reacted. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react completely with the acetic acid.

Wait, but the stoichiometry is 1:1, so the moles of NaOH added is 0.00025. The total volume at this point would be the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH used. Wait, but how much NaOH was added? Let me calculate the volume.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. Moles = concentration × volume, so volume = moles / concentration. So volume of NaOH = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. So the total solution volume at 25% is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

But wait, maybe I should approach this using the initial moles and see what's left after 25% titration. Let me think. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol reacts with NaOH. So the moles of CH3COOH left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

This sounds like a buffer solution, because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, but I need to find the concentrations of A^- and HA. The total volume is 40 cm³ plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³. Let me compute [A^-] and [HA].

Molarity of HA (CH3COOH) is 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M. Molarity of A^- (CH3COO^-) is 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, the pKa. The given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa ≈ 4.733.

Henderson equation: pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, and option D has 4.57, which is higher.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the ratio. 0.00025 / 0.0425 is 0.005882 M. 0.00075 / 0.0425 is 0.017647 M. So the ratio is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So the ratio is 1/3. Log(1/3) is -0.477, so yes, pH is about 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So the first part is 4.26. Looking at the options, A is 4.26 and 8.52. D has 4.57 which doesn't fit. So the first part is 4.26.

Now, the second part is the pH at equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base. Hence, the solution will be basic.

The moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: same as moles of acetic acid. Initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. So, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So total solution volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L.

The concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb can be found using Kw/Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. Right.

The hydrolysis reaction of acetate ions: the concentration is 0.02 M. Let me set up the expression.

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Let's denote [OH^-] = x. So,

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So,

x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. Therefore, pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recompute Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405. So 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider the exact equation without approximation. Let's write:

5.405e-10 = x^2 / (0.02 - x). But since x is small, maybe the approximation holds. Let me plug in x = 1.04e-5 into 0.02 - x. 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 - 1.04e-5 is approximately 0.0199896, which is 0.02. So the approximation holds.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98, so pH is about 9.02. Hmm, but the options don't have 9.02. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 4.26; 8.52
B) 3.17; 6.73  
C) 4.73; 7.00
D) 4.57; 6.92  

Wait, none of the options have a pH near 9.02. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the concentration of acetate. Let me recheck.

The initial acetic acid was 0.025 M in 40 cm³. Equivalence point: all 0.001 moles are neutralized. So the solution is 0.001 mol in a total volume of 50 cm³ (40 + 10 cm³ of NaOH). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb expression. Let me recheck. The Kb is correct, and the setup seems right. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the correct formula.

Another approach: For acetate ion, the hydrolysis reaction produces OH^-.

The formula for pH at equivalence point when a weak acid is titrated with a strong base is given by:

pH = pKa2 + log(s) + ½ log([HA]/s)

Wait, no, that's for polyprotic acids. Alternatively, the pH can be calculated using the formula for the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

Another way: The concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The formula is:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) 

Assuming that x is much smaller than C, so x ≈ sqrt(Kb * C).

So:

sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, which gives [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5. So pOH ≈ 4.98, pH = 9.02.

But none of the options have this. Hmm. That suggests I may have made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then 20 cm³ of water is added, making total 40 cm³. So the diluted concentration is 0.025 M.

Then, the moles of acetic acid are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. That's correct.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol are neutralized. The volume of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So total solution is 40 +10 = 50 cm³, 0.05 L. So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, so why don't any options have pH around 9.02? Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the Kb or pKa.

Wait, the given Ka is 1.85e-5. Let me recheck that. Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact approach without the approximation. Let's see.

The equation is:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98, pH is 14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm. So the pH at equivalence is around 9.02, but the options don't have that. Let's see what the options say. Option A says 8.52, D says 6.92. Hmm, none near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is converted into acetate. But wait, acetate is a weak base, and it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions. So the solution should be basic, pH >7. The options only have A with 8.52, which is less than 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for buffer solution, but that's only applicable before equivalence.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the volume of NaOH. Let me recheck. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001. When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, to reach equivalence, the volume is 10 cm³. So total volume is 40+10=50 cm³.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution after equivalence is not properly considered. Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acid is converted to the acetate ion.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact Kb without approximation.

Let me set up the equation without approximation:

x^2 / (0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Let me denote x as [OH^-] = y.

So, y² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 - y).

Assuming y is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - y ≈ 0.02. But let's see if the approximation holds.

From the earlier estimate, y ≈ 1.04e-5. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 1.04e-5 is much smaller than 2e-2, so the approximation holds. So the earlier calculation is correct. So I must have made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is incorrect. Let me recheck that.

Initial volume: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Adding 20 cm³ of water: total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me calculate it again.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

The formula OH^- concentration is sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH = 14 -4.98=9.02.

But none of the options have that. Let me look at the options again to see if perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the pH at 25% of the way to the equivalence point, not 25% of the initial solution. Wait, the question says 25% titration. So 25% of the way to the equivalence point.

Wait, that's what I did. So the first part should be correct.

But the equivalence point pH is not matching any of the options. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: maybe the solution after equivalence is not just acetate, but perhaps some excess OH from NaOH. But no, NaOH is a strong base, so at equivalence, all the NaOH has reacted. So the solution is only acetate and its conjugate acid.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I calculated the Kb. Let me recheck that.

Ka = 1.85e-5. Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the solution is 50 cm³. Let me recheck the volume calculation. 20 cm³ + 20 cm³ =40 cm³. Adding 10 cm³ NaOH gives 50 cm³. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH by considering the hydrolysis without the approximation.

So,

y² = Kb * (0.02 - y).

Assuming y is small, but let's see:

y² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 - y).

Let me rearrange:

y² +5.405e-10 * y - (5.405e-10 *0.02) =0.

This is a quadratic equation: y² + (5.405e-10) y - (1.081e-11) =0.

Using quadratic formula:

y = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)] / 2a.

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 *1.081e-11.

(5.405e-10)^2 = approx 2.92e-19.

4ac =4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) → but in the equation, it's -c, so 4 *1 *1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

So D = 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible).

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So y = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Taking the positive root (since concentration can't be negative):

y ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, that's different from the earlier approximation. So [OH^-] ≈3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈5.487 → pH=14-5.487=8.513.

Oh, wait! That's around 8.51, which is close to option A's second value of 8.52. So that changes things. So at equivalence, pH is about 8.51.

Wait, so earlier I thought the pH was 9.02, but that was due to a miscalculation when I didn't use the quadratic properly. So the correct pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51.

So now, looking back at the first part, I thought the pH at 25% titration was 4.26, which is option A's first value. So the two values would be 4.26 and 8.52, which matches option A.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the pH at 25% without considering the quadratic, I got 4.26, which is correct. But at equivalence, using the quadratic gives me 8.51, which is option A's second value.

So the two values are 4.26 and 8.52, which matches option A. So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, followed by titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution**
The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{\text{moles of acetic acid}}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

---

### **Step 2: pH at 25% titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has reacted with NaOH, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### **Step 3: pH at the equivalence point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate ion is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak base hydrolysis:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] \approx \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.0200)} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, using the quadratic equation for a more precise calculation gives:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}, \quad \text{pOH} \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
