Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to move a bit. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets.

The key data given is the shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but I think the shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

I remember the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) ) * (P)^( -1/3 )

Wait, but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I think the formula relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P. Oh wait, another approach: the RV method gives us the velocity of the star, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Alternatively, I think the relation for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think differently. The RV method measures the star's velocity. The formula for velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * 2π ) )

But I might be mixing up the formula. Another way I remember is that when the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity is given by v = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

Wait, but since M_p (planet mass) is much smaller than M_* (star mass), which is solar mass, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies to:

v ≈ ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) )

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula, but perhaps I can think in terms of the relationship between the velocity shift and the orbital period.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of the Doppler shift and the orbital period. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity observed, and it's related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Let's see, I think the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) / (c)

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Another approach: the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c³ ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_* + M_p)^(2/3)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to think of the scaling relation between the two planets.

Since both stars have the same mass (solar mass), and both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), the only difference is the velocity shift. So the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (P)^( -1/3 ). Because if we look at K proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) ), but since M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, more accurately, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2π / (P * c) ) )^(1/3 )

But perhaps a better way is to use the simplified version when M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_*^2) )^(1/3) * (2π / (P * c) )^(1/3 ) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_* )^... )

Hmm, maybe that's getting too messy. Alternatively, since both stars have the same mass and planets have the same mass, the velocity semi-amplitude K should be inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, because K ∝ (P)^(-1/3). So if K1 and K2 are the velocities for planet 1 and 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again. The formula I remember is that K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * (1 / P)^(1/3). So K = (something) * (M_p) / (M_*)^(1/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

So because M_p and M_* are same for both, K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (same factors) So if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (same for both, so 1). So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait. Because if K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = (constant) * 1/(P1)^(1/3), K2 = (constant) * 1/(P2)^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So rearranging, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but wait. Because the velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So higher K means shorter period.

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, since K2 is larger, that would mean P2 is shorter than P1. But wait, looking at the problem again, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So P2 / P1 = ?

Wait, if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then since K1 < K2, P1 is larger than P2, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K → smaller P.

So using K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, no, because earlier I think the formula is that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1 = C * (1/P1)^(1/3), K2 = C * (1/P2)^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So K1/K2 = (1/P1)^(1/3) / (1/P2)^(1/3) ) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So (5/7) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, wait. Wait, no, I think I messed up the ratio. Let me recalculate.

K1 = C * (1/P1)^(1/3 )

K2 = C * (1/P2)^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (1/P1)^(1/3) / (1/P2)^(1/3) ) = (P2/ P1 )^(1/3 )

So (5/7) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So (125)/(343) = P2/P1 ≈ 0.364

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364 → which means P2 is about 0.364 times P1, so P1 is about 2.75 times longer than P2. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Wait, no, the question says: how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So P2 / P1 is the ratio. From above, P2/P1 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, which is shorter.

Wait, but that's impossible because the question is phrased as 'how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So if P2 is shorter, that ratio is less than 1, so the periods are not longer, but shorter. But looking at the options, the options are A) 0.36, B) 1.40, C) 1.96, D) 0.85.

Wait, but according to the calculation, P2 is about 0.36 times P1. But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's 0.36 times longer? Or wait, no. Wait, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~2.75. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning planet #2's period is shorter, not longer. So the ratio of P2 / P1 is ~0.36. So if the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1, the answer would be 0.36 times, which is option A.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me recheck.

Given K1 = 5, K2 =7. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

We have K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So 5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, which means P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the host star, which reflects the star's motion due to the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the velocity shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for planets with similar masses and host stars of the same mass. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that Planet #1 causes a velocity shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)) and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)), the ratio of their velocity semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the periods is related to the inverse cube of the velocity shift ratio:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times longer than Planet #1's. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.36**

Answer: A
