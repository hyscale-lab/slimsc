Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you have a complex ion like Ca-EDTA, it's formed by a metal ion and a ligand binding together. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So the complex here is CaEDTA.

The problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the pH is ideal. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, I think the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Is that right? And the K for this reaction is given as 5e10, which is a big number, meaning the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

But wait, the formula for K would be [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So K = [complex]/([metal][ligand]). So in this case, K is 5e10.

But wait, the initial solution has 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of Ca²+ in solution, which would be [Ca²+].

Assuming the complex dissociates a little bit, but since K is so large, maybe the dissociation is minimal. But I shouldn't assume that without checking.

Wait, let's think. If the complex is present, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let me write the equilibrium expression.

At equilibrium, the concentration of CaEDTA is approximately 0.02 minus some x, but since K is so large, x would be very small. So [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M.

So the equation would be K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]).

But wait, EDTA is present as EDTA^4- and other species. Oh, because EDTA is a polydentate ligand, but in solution, especially at a certain pH, it exists in different protonation states. But the problem says pH is ideal, so I think it's in the form of EDTA^4- which is the deprotonated form that can bind to Ca²+.

Wait, but in reality, EDTA exists in various protonated forms, but here, the problem simplifies it by assuming the pH is such that the EDTA is in the correct form to bind Ca²+. So I can treat EDTA as simply EDTA^4-.

So, from the complex dissociation, if the complex is 0.02 M, then when it dissociates, it produces some [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-].

Wait, but wait. Let's model it. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M. Then, when it dissociates, the change would be:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

Let the change be x. So at equilibrium, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small because K is large, so the complex is mostly undissociated).

So [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA] = x as well, because each complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So plugging into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]) = 0.02/(x * x) = 0.02 / x².

So 5e10 = 0.02/(x²).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, K is given as 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2)

So solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2e-3) / (5e10) = (2)/(5e13) ) = 4e-14.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that again.

0.02 is 2e-2.

So 5e10 = (2e-2) / (x^2)

So x^2 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2)/(5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, because 2e-2 is 2*1e-2, and 5e10 is 5*1e10.

So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Hmm.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7, but wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is about 6.32e-7.

So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check my math.

Wait, K is 5e10, [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M.

So K = 5e10 = 0.02 / (x²).

So x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-2 /5e10 = 2/(5e12) = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7 M.

Yes, that's correct. So the concentration of calcium ions is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction for the dissociation of the complex is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of the dissociated calcium ions and EDTA be \( x \). At equilibrium:
- \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K \)),
- \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = x\),
- \([ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\).

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]}{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
