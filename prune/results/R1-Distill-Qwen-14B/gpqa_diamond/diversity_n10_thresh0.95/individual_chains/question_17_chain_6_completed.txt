Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is that chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. It binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly. 

The problem gives me the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant is a measure of the stability of the complex; the higher the K, the more stable the complex. So that means the calcium ions are tightly bound by EDTA, right?

Wait, the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Because EDTA is a strong chelator, most of the calcium is probably tied up in the complex, so the free ion concentration should be really low. 

So, what's the reaction here? I think the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since K is so large, the complex is favored, so the reverse reaction (breaking down the complex) is not favored, meaning [Ca²+] should be very small.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA²−] as 0.02 M. But I think in this case, it's a 1:1 complex. So the stoichiometry is 1 mole of Ca²+ to 1 mole of EDTA^4- forming 1 mole of CaEDTA²-.

I need to find [Ca²+]. Let me set up the equation. The formation constant K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

But wait, what about the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-? Well, if we start only with the complex (0.02 M), assuming that the solution doesn't have any free Ca²+ or EDTA^4- initially, but that's not possible. Wait, no, the complex dissociates slightly. So initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the change would involve dissociation. Let's model that.

Let’s let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. So,

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is probably very small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x (because each mole of complex releases one mole of EDTA^4− as well)

Wait, no. Wait, the EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, right? So the EDTA is in the form of EDTA^4−. So when the complex dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So the concentrations of both ions are x.

So the K expression becomes:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = 2e-3 / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 → wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → that's 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-12)=1e-6. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-7)^2, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Let me compute that: 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. Oh, wait, that's approximately 6.3e-7 M. So x is about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: sometimes, the formation constant is given as Kf, which is [ML]/([M][L]). So in this case, Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

Assuming that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. If we let s be the concentration of free Ca²+, then the concentration of free EDTA^4− is also s, because each dissociation gives one of each. So:

Kf = (0.02)/(s^2) =5e10 → s^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → s^2 = 4e-13 → s=2e-6.5 → which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Yes, so this confirms the previous calculation. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Since the complex dissociates slightly, the concentration of the complex remains approximately \(0.02 \, \text{M}\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
