Okay, so I have this question about symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what do I remember about SMEFT? It stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? It's a framework that includes the Standard Model and adds higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the Standard Model physics. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc.

Now, the question is about which symmetries all these operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

I think Lorentz symmetry is a big one. Because the SMEFT is a field theory, and in any relativistic theory, Lorentz symmetry is fundamental. The operators should be scalars under the Lorentz group. Wait, but are all operators automatically Lorentz invariant? I think so, because the theory itself is built respecting Lorentz symmetry. So operators must be Lorentz scalars.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if Lorentz is respected, does that mean Poincare is automatically? Or is Poincare a separate consideration? Wait, the Poincare group includes translations, which relate to momentum conservation. But I think that in the SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. Alternatively, maybe Poincare is automatically respected because the theory is a low-energy effective theory and the Standard Model already respects it.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Lorentz symmetry is about local transformations, whereas Poincare includes global translations. Or wait, Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So if the theory respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? Because Poincare is a larger symmetry group. Or maybe the SMEFT is built to respect Poincare symmetry because it's a field theory, so all operators must transform correctly under Poincare. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's a must for all operators. Or perhaps the question treats Lorentz and Poincare as separate symmetries.

Wait, I think that Poincare symmetry might not directly apply because the SMEFT is an effective theory. Effective theories can sometimes break some symmetries when considering certain limits, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT still respects Poincare symmetry because it's a valid symmetry at the energy scales it's applicable.

Now, CP symmetry. The Standard Model (SM) doesn't respect CP in general because of the CKM problem, but the SMEFT includes the SM, so operators can violate CP. Wait, but that can't be right. No, wait, no. The SM has certain CP violations, but the SMEFT includes those. So if the operators in SMEFT can violate CP, that means that the operators themselves don't have to respect CP symmetry. For example, the operators could have terms that change under CP. Therefore, does each operator have to be CP-even or can they be CP-odd? I think the SMEFT allows for operators that violate CP. So the operators are not required to respect CP symmetry. So number 3, CP symmetry, is not necessarily a symmetry that all operators must respect.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry. Any theory that respects Poincare symmetry must also respect CPT symmetry. Wait, is that correct? I think that in any Poincare-invariant theory, CPT is a symmetry. Because the Poincare algebra includes CPT transformations as automorphisms. So if a theory respects Poincare, it must respect CPT. So if the SMEFT respects Poincare (which I think it does), then all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, if the theory respects Lorentz, then operators must be Lorentz scalars. If the theory respects Poincare, then operators must also transform correctly under Poincare. And because of that, CPT must be respected. But wait, the operator themselves don't have to individually be CPT symmetric, but the entire theory must respect CPT. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is about each operator individually respecting those symmetries. Because if that's the case, then for the operator to be allowed, it must be a scalar (Lorentz), and also must transform correctly under Poincare. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT requires the operators to be Lorentz scalars and to respect CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP or Poincare.

Alternatively, think about the possible combinations of the options. The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect?

I think Lorentz symmetry must be respected (operator must be Lorentz scalar). So 1 is in.

Poincare symmetry: I'm not entirely sure. If the SMEFT is a field theory, then operators should transform correctly under Poincare. But wait, Poincare includes translations, which relate to momentum. But operators in the SMEFT are built as local operators, so maybe they automatically respect Poincare. Or maybe the question treats Poincare as a given, so all operators must respect it.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if the theory is Poincare invariant, then all operators must transform appropriately under Poincare.

But perhaps the SMEFT doesn't necessarily require operators to respect Poincare individually. Because Poincare is a global symmetry, and the SMEFT is built in a way that the theory as a whole respects Poincare, but individual operators may have their own transformation properties.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think differently. Which of these symmetries are part of the basic structure of the SMEFT.

The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars, so Lorentz symmetry is definitely must.

What about Poincare? Poincare includes Lorentz and translation. Since the SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincare. So operators must transform correctly. So 2 is also a must.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident because sometimes translation symmetry isn't considered when talking about individual operators. But in a field theory, each term is a scalar, so I think yes, the operators must respect Poincare.

Then, CPT symmetry. Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. So CPT is a must.

CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not necessarily a symmetry of the SMEFT. The SM has CP violation, so the SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry.

So the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So looking at the options, which one includes 1, 2, and 4? Let's see the options.

Option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1 and 2. So the correct answer should include all three: 1, 2, 4.

Wait, but the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the operators must be Poincare-respecting, then the answer would include 1 and 2 and 4.

But wait, Poincare is a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So perhaps Poincare is implied by Lorentz and translation. But maybe in the SMEFT, the operators only need to respect Lorentz and CPT, because CPT is connected via Lorentz and other considerations.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let me think about the symmetries of the SMEFT.

The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct.

The SMEFT is also a Poincare-invariant theory because it's a field theory, so it must respect all aspects of Poincare, including translations. Therefore, all operators must be Poincare scalars as well. So 2 is correct.

CPT symmetry: For any Lorentz-invariant theory, the product of C, P, and T transformations must be a symmetry. So the entire theory must be CPT-invariant. Therefore, all operators must be arranged in a way that the theory respects CPT. So 4 is correct.

CP symmetry: The SMEFT can have terms that violate CP, such as the operators involving the CKM matrix elements in the SM. So operators don't have to respect CP. So 3 is not a must.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but option C is A) 1,2; C) 1,2,4; so option C includes all three. So the answer should be C.

But wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, another point: The Poincare symmetry includes translations, which are global symmetries. I think that in the SMEFT, the operators are written as local operators, so perhaps they don't have to individually respect Poincare symmetry because the theory as a whole respects it. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers Poincare and Lorentz as separate symmetries.

Wait, perhaps Lorentz and Poincare are considered together. So in the SMEFT, all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT doesn't require operators to respect Poincare, but just Lorentz. Because translation symmetries are more about momentum conservation, which is a global symmetry, perhaps the operators can have non-zero momentum, but the sum of all terms must respect Poincare.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so I'll proceed with what I think is correct. I think the correct answer is C) 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a Lorentz-invariant framework that includes the Standard Model and higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and must respect certain symmetries. Let us analyze the given options to determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is a relativistic field theory, and all operators must be Lorentz scalars. This is a fundamental requirement for the theory to be consistent with special relativity. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: The Poincaré group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Since the SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry as a whole. Operators are constructed to transform correctly under Poincaré transformations, making this symmetry a requirement. Thus, Poincaré symmetry (2) must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model already includes CP-violating terms, such as those arising from the CKM matrix. The SMEFT inherits this feature and allows operators that violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement that all operators must respect.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Since the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Thus, CPT symmetry (4) is a requirement.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**

Answer: C
