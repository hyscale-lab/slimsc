Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Hmm. Let's see.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Since it's proportional, I guess I need to normalize it first. Oh right, because any quantum state must have a norm (inner product with itself) equal to 1.

Wait, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin, so they form an orthonormal basis. That makes things easier because the inner product of |up> with |down> is zero, and each with themselves is 1.

So the state is |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2 - i)|down>, where a is the normalization constant. Let me compute the normalization condition: the sum of the squares (actually, the squared magnitudes) of the coefficients should be 1.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i), multiplied by a. So the square of their magnitudes:

|1+i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) = 2.
|2 - i|^2 = (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5.

So the sum is (2 +5)|a|^2 =7|a|^2. Since the state must be normalized, 7|a|^2 =1 → |a|^2 =1/7 → a=1/sqrt(7). So the state becomes |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as proportional, so maybe I should just proceed with the coefficients as is without worrying about normalization yet. Or perhaps I should include the normalization factor in the state.

Wait, the state is given as proportional, so I can write |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, but I need to normalize it. So I'll compute the normalization factor.

The norm is sqrt( |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 ) = sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator whose matrix representation is A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the basis here? It must be the same as the state's basis, which is |up> and |down>, so the eigenstates of S_z.

So the matrix for operator A in the z-basis is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. For a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j run from 1 to 2. So A_11 = 0 (because i=j=1), A_22=0. The off-diagonal elements (A_12 and A_21) are ħ/2 each.

Wait, no, wait. The matrix representation elements are A_ij. So when i≠j, A_ij = ħ/2. So the matrix is:

[0, ħ/2;
 ħ/2, 0]

Wait, no, wait. Because i and j are row and column indices, so A_12 is ħ/2, A_21 is ħ/2, and the diagonals are 0. So the matrix is:

0   ħ/2
ħ/2 0

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So the operator is A = (ħ/2) ( |up><down| + |down><up| ). That's because |up><down| is the matrix with 1 at (1,2) and 0 elsewhere, same for |down><up| which has 1 at (2,1). So adding them gives the off-diagonal 1s, multiplied by ħ/2.

So this operator A is actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, but what are the eigenstates of A? Since A is proportional to σ_x, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(±1) → ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and then the probabilities are the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, its eigenstates form a basis, and the state can be expanded in terms of these eigenstates. The probabilities are the squares of the expansion coefficients.

So, first, find the eigenstates of A.

Since A = (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenstates are the same as σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), because σ_x |+x> = |+x>, etc.

Wait, wait. Let me do it properly. The eigenstates of σ
