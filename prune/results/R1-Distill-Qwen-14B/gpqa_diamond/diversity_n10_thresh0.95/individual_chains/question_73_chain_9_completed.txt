Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because the rules change. Let me think about this step by step.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The problem asks for the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So first, I need to find the relative speed between them. Oh right, because they're moving in the same direction, I can't just subtract the speeds like I would in classical physics. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Let me recall that formula. Oh right, the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity, when two objects are moving in the same direction, is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, which way is which here? Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the relative speed is the difference in their velocities, but calculated relativistically.

Wait, actually, the formula for when object A is moving at u and object B at v is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So here, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So the relative speed of A from B's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7. Oh wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428... So about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That matches some of the options.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. Or wait, relativistic energy includes kinetic plus rest mass. Wait, actually, in relativity, the total energy is gamma times m c squared. So for each astronaut, I have to compute their gamma factor and multiply by their mass, then sum them.

Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So each astronaut's energy is their own gamma * m_i * c². So I need to compute each one's energy and sum them.

Let me compute each gamma.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m) moving at 0.6c:

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So their energy is 2m * gamma1 * c² = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait no. Wait, the energy is gamma * m_total * c². Wait, the astronaut's rest mass is 2m, so their total energy is gamma * (2m) c². So yeah, 1.25 *2m c²= 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m) moving at 0.5c:

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So their energy is 3m * gamma2 * c² ≈ 3m * 1.1547 c² = approximately 3.464 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc² which is lower. So option C must be the correct one.

Wait, were there any other possible mistakes? Let me double-check the relative speed calculation. So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So using the formula:

(u - v) / (1 - uv/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's correct.

And the energy calculation: 2.5 + 3.464 is about 5.964, so 5.96 mc². So that's option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic velocity and energy calculations for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2 \).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**.
