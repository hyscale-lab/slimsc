Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and it's asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means a more distant one.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that their actual spatial density (number per volume) is constant. But since we're considering parallax, which relates to distance, I need to think about how the number of stars relates to the parallax ranges.

Let me think in terms of a volume. The number of stars should be proportional to the volume. The volume element in spherical coordinates would be 4π r² dr, because you're looking at a shell of radius r and thickness dr. Here, r is the distance to the star.

But wait, parallax plx is 1/r. So r = 1/plx. Let me substitute that. So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)² d(1/plx). Wait, that derivative part might get tricky. Let me compute dr when plx changes by dplx.

Since r = 1/plx, dr = (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, no, I think I messed up a step.

Wait, the volume in terms of r is 4π r² dr. So in terms of plx, r is 1/plx. So 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr is (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, I think I made a mistake in substitution. Let me redo it.

r = 1/plx.

So r^2 dr = (1/plx)^2 * (dr). But dr is (1/plx^2) dplx. So:

r^2 dr = (1/plx²) * (1/plx² dplx) )= (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the volume element (which is 4π r² dr) becomes 4π * (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. So the number of stars per unit volume is a constant, say n. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n*dV.

So the number per unit plx would be n * (4π) * (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the problem says "number of stars per unit range of plx." So if you have a small range dplx, the number is n * 4π * (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but let me think again. Are we considering how the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx depends on plx?

Alternatively, maybe I should think of the number of stars as being proportional to the volume, and the volume depends on 1/plx^4 as I have here. So the number of stars per unit plx would go like 1/plx^4, which would mean the answer is option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait, another approach: Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a region depends on the volume. The volume at a certain distance r (which is 1/plx) with a small change dr is about 4π r² dr. But dr = (1/plx^2) dplx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 (1/plx^2 dplx) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number of stars is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct dependence is 1/plx^4. So the answer must be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), where \( r \) is the distance in parsecs. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars is proportional to the volume of a spherical shell at a distance \( r \), which is \( 4\pi r^2 \, dr \). 

Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume element becomes:

\[
4\pi r^2 \, dr = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \, dr.
\]

Since \( dr = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \), the volume element in terms of parallax is:

\[
4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
