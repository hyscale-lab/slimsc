Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are different powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit as seen from the star, and it's inversely proportional to the distance. So plx = 1/distance, right? Or wait, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 over the distance in parsecs. So if distance r is in parsecs, then plx = 1/r.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx as 1/r, that would be N proportional to 1/( (1/r)^5 ), right? Wait, 1 over (1/r)^5 is the same as r^5, because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 over that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So I think they're asking for the number of stars as a function of distance. But wait, when you talk about the number per unit distance, that's the differential. Because the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr would be something.

So let me think about this. The number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume. But wait, the way the question is phrased is that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So maybe the number of stars is proportional to (1/plx^5). Since plx is inversely proportional to r (distance), then 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

But wait, that's the total number of stars up to distance r? Or is it the number per unit volume? Hmm, perhaps I should model it more carefully.

Wait, the number of stars is given as a function of parallax. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, then 1/plx = r. So N ∝ r^5. But this would mean that as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But that doesn't make much sense because when you look further away, the stars should get fainter and sparser.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, perhaps the number of stars per unit area (since it's a region of the sky) is given by N ∝ 1/(plx^5). So N is the number per unit area at a certain distance. Because when you look at a region of the sky, the number of stars you see depends on how many are in that direction at various distances. Hmm, perhaps integrating along the line of sight.

Alternatively, think of it as a differential number. The number of stars per unit volume in the direction of the sky could be involved. Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance.

Parallax plx = 1 / r (if r is in parsecs). So r = 1/plx.

If the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx^5), then substituting r = 1/plx, we have N ∝ (1/( (1/r)^5 )) → N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but N is the number of stars in some region, perhaps per unit area? So for a given area, the number of stars at distance r would vary with r^5. But that seems odd because as you go further, more stars would mean a higher density, but in reality, stars are spread out more as you look further. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, wait. The number of stars you see is higher when you can see further because there's more volume to sample. But the brightness also drops, so it's a trade-off.

Wait, perhaps we should model the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r. The volume of a thin spherical shell at radius r is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume times the number density. But in this problem, the number varies with parallax, so maybe the number per unit area is given as 1/plx^5.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit area as a function of distance. So for a given area (like a small patch in the sky), the number of stars you observe depends on the distance.

But wait, that doesn't quite fit. Because the number of stars you observe in a certain direction would be the integral along the line of sight, considering the density of stars at each distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit solid angle and per unit distance is given as varying with 1/plx^5. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider that the number of stars as a function of parallax is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to r (plx = 1/r), then 1/(plx)^5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

But how does the number of stars change with distance? If N increases with r^5, that would mean that as you go further away, you're seeing more stars. But that's counterintuitive because stars get fainter with distance. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the flux or brightness.

Wait, the problem doesn't involve brightness but the actual count of stars. So if the number of stars you observe in a region varies with 1/plx^5, that would mean that as plx decreases (i.e., distance increases), the number of stars increases as r^5. So for each unit increase in r, the number would go up by r^5. But that would imply that the number of stars increases rapidly with distance, which doesn't make sense because beyond a certain distance, you wouldn't see more stars because they are too dim. So maybe I'm not modeling this correctly.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit distance (per parsec, say) in a given direction. So for a given direction (a line of sight), the number of stars in that direction per parsec is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, this is r^5 per parsec. But that would mean that the number of stars per parsec increases as you go further away, which is again counterintuitive. I might be getting mixed up between number density and observed counts.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of stars in a volume. Let's think about it another way. The number of stars in a volume is N = n * V, where n is the number density (stars per volume) and V is the volume. If the number density varies with distance, then N would depend on both n and V.

But in the problem, it says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps n (number density) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let's explore that.

If n is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and since plx = 1/r, then n ∝ r^5.

But the number of stars in a volume would be n multiplied by the volume. Let's say we're considering a spherical volume of radius r. The volume V is (4/3)π r³. So N = n * V = (constant * r^5) * (r^3) = constant * r^8. But that's if the number density increases as r^5, which would make the total number go up rapidly. But that's not matching any of the options given here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a volume but about a fixed area on the celestial sphere. Let's imagine that each star is at a certain distance, and we're counting how many stars are within a certain distance range. So the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would be the number density n(r) multiplied by the surface area of the shell (4π r² dr). So dN = n(r) * 4π r² dr.

If n(r) is the number density (stars per unit volume) at distance r, and if n(r) is proportional to 1/(plx^5) = r^5, then dN would be proportional to r^5 * r^2 dr = r^7 dr. But that doesn't align with the options given either. The options are r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about how the number of stars in a region depends on distance. The question says that N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So for a given area on the sky, the number of stars you can see increases as r^5. That seems like a lot, but perhaps the question is about how the number of stars (density) changes per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the differential number of stars per unit distance. So if the number of stars N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N per unit change in r would be dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^5, so the rate of change is r^4. But looking at the options, option C is r^4, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is r^5 and option C is r^4. So the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is 5 r^4. So the answer would be r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but another way to think about this is the number of stars per unit volume. Let me try that. If N is proportional to r^5, then the number density (n) would be N divided by the volume. The volume up to radius r is (4/3) π r^3. So n = N / V = (k r^5) / ( (4/3) π r^3 ) ) → n = (3k)/(4π) r^2. So n ∝ r^2. So the number density increases with r squared. But that's not directly answering the question, which is about how the number of stars in the region changes with distance. The question says per unit range of distance, so perhaps it's the number per unit distance, which would be dN/dr.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate the problem. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = C / (plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, N = C r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So if distance r increases, N increases with the fifth power. Now, the question is how does N change with distance, per unit range. So the change in N as r increases by dr would be dN = 5 C r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is 5 C r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4, meaning the number of stars in a region increases with r^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but that can't be right, because when r increases, the volume increases, so more stars would be in a larger volume. But if N is the number of stars per unit area, perhaps it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit area (on the sky) at a distance r is N = C / (plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, N = C r^5. So for each unit area on the sky, the number of stars at distance r is proportional to r^5. That would mean that as you look further away, the number of stars per unit area increases. Which doesn't make sense because stars are spread out more, and their flux drops. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way I'm interpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps it's the number density. Let me think again. The number density (n) is the number of stars per unit volume. So if n is proportional to 1/plx^5, then n ∝ r^5. So for a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr, the number of stars would be n * 4π r² dr = k r^5 * 4π r² dr = 4 π k r^7 dr. So the number increases with r^7, which is not matching any of the options.

But wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Maybe that's the number per unit area, so N = C (1/plx^5) per unit area. Then as r increases, plx decreases, so N increases as r^5. So for each unit area, the number of stars in that area increases with r^5. But that seems to suggest that looking further away, you'd see more stars in the same area, which doesn't make sense because you'd see fainter ones but perhaps more are present.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So if N ∝ r^5, then the derivative dN/dr is 5r^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C, ~r^4.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

So the answer should be C.


The problem states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto r^5
\]

This means the total number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. However, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we compute the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \):

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the rate at which the number of stars changes with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). This matches option C.

Critical analysis of the options:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect. The relationship \( N \propto r^5 \) implies a higher rate of change than \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect. This represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct. The derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \) describes the change in the number of stars per unit distance.
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect. This does not align with the given relationship \( N \propto r^5 \).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
