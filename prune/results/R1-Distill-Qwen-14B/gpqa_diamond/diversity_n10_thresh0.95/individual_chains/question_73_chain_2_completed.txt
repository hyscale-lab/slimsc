Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Right, so relativistic speeds mean I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to consider special relativity here.

The question has two parts: relative speed and total energy. Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with the relative speed. I remember that when you're dealing with velocities in special relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical physics. There's a formula for adding velocities, right? Oh wait, yeah, the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, which one is moving relative to the other? Because relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

Wait, so astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or vice versa? Let me think. If both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

So, the formula for relative velocity is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). But I have to make sure which one is in which frame. Let me clarify: astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So in the rest frame of astronaut A, the speed of astronaut B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Wait, wait, that can't be right because 0.5c is less than 0.6c, so the numerator would be negative, which would mean B is moving backward relative to A. No, wait, no, because both are moving in the same direction, right? So in A's frame, B is moving slower than A. So from A's perspective, B's speed would be positive in the same direction but slower. Hmm, but wait, the formula gives the speed of B as seen from A's frame. Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, u is the velocity of B in the original frame (which is 0.5c), and v is the velocity of the frame (A's frame) relative to the original frame (which is moving at 0.6c). No, wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me restate: the original frame is the one where both are moving in the same direction. So A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c in that frame.

So, the velocity of B as seen from A's frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Since A is the moving observer, and we want to find B's velocity relative to A. So u is 0.5c (B's velocity in original frame), v is 0.6c (A's velocity in original frame). Plugging in:

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²)
= (-0.1c) / (1 - (0.3c²)/c²)
= (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)
= (-0.1c) / 0.7
= -0.142857c

Wait, the negative sign indicates direction. But since the problem asks for speed, the magnitude is 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So relative speed is about 0.142c, which is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

But wait, another thing. I'm assuming that the relative speed is how fast one is moving with respect to the other. But wait, the problem states "their relative speed." Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference, but adjusted for relativity. So the calculation steps are correct.

Now, moving on to the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of their relativistic energies. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for each astronaut, I'll calculate their energy and sum them.

Astronaut A: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.
Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2)
0.6 squared is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma_A is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.
Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2)
0.5 squared is 0.25, so 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. Gamma_B = 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. Option B is 4.96, which is lower. So the energy part of option C is correct, and the relative speed is 0.14c, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait, in the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that's a match.

Alternatively, let me double-check the calculations.

Gamma for A:

Speed 0.6c: beta = 0.6.

1 - beta² = 1 -0.36=0.64.

sqrt(0.64)=0.8, so gamma=1/0.8=1.25. Correct.

E_A=1.25 * 2m c²=2.5 m c².

Gamma for B:

Speed 0.5c, beta=0.5.

1 - beta²=0.75.

sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660.

So gamma=1/sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(4/3)=~1.1547.

E_B=1.1547 *3m c²=3.464 m c².

Adding E_A and E_B: 2.5 +3.464=5.964 m c², which rounds to 5.96 mc².

So that's correct.

So the answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me check the relative speed again. The calculation gave me approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c, which is option C or D. Option D has 5 mc² for energy, which is lower than our calculated value. So the correct answer is C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed and the total energy of the system consisting of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Here's the analysis:

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction cannot be calculated using classical subtraction. Instead, the relativistic velocity addition formula is used:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of astronaut B in the original frame),
- \( v = 0.6c \) (velocity of astronaut A in the original frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
u' = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3}
\]

\[
u' = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1429c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but since the problem asks for speed, the magnitude is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy formula is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A:
- Mass = \( 2m \),
- Velocity = \( 0.6c \).

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B:
- Mass = \( 3m \),
- Velocity = \( 0.5c \).

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
