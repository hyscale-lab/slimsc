Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me look at each part one by one.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. I remember that IR peaks can tell us about functional groups. The very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably an O-H stretch. Broad peaks in that region are usually from either alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, the two other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a region where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids) absorb. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching in aromatic compounds) or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Wait, but 1700 is more like a strong carbonyl, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe a ketone with some conjugation.

Next, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests there's a double bond in the structure. That could align with the 1650 cm^-1 peak, which might be an aromatic ring but maybe not. Alternatively, an alkene's C=C stretching is usually around 1650-1600 cm^-1, so that fits. So perhaps the compound has both an alkene and a carbonyl group.

Now, the mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm trying to think what could give that. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (which is 43), but 45 is a bit higher. Wait, 45 could be the fragment (CH2)2O, which is 45 (since 2*CH2 = 24, O is 16, so 24+16=40? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's the (CH3)2CO+ ion, which would be 58. Hmm. Or perhaps it's a CH2O group, which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. Wait, 45. What's 45 in terms of possible fragments? Maybe a CH2CH2O group? Or perhaps a (CH2)2O structure. Let me think. 45 is 29 (CH2CH2O maybe?) Wait, wait, maybe it's the methyl ester fragment. Alternatively, think about the molecular formula possibilities.

The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So possible formulas. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation for each.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For C6H12O:

C=6, H=12, O=1.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So maybe a ring plus a double bond? Or just a double bond and a ring? Wait, 1 DoU would be one ring or one double bond. But if I have more, then DoU would be higher. So the formula C6H12O has one DoU. But the presence of a vinyl group (double bond) would account for one DoU, so maybe a ring as well? Or maybe the carbonyl as another DoU? Wait, but then DoU would need to be two in that case.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU. But if the compound has both a carbonyl (which is a double bond, contributing one DoU) and a ring, then that's two DoUs. So this formula doesn't support that. Hmm, so maybe this is not the right formula.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two DoUs. That could be one ring and one double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds, or one ring and a carbonyl.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (14 -10)/2=2. Same as option B.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU is 1. So same as option A.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is O-H. So the compound has an O-H group, so either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the FTIR peak at 1700 could be a carbonyl. But if it's an alcohol with a carbonyl, that would require two oxygen-containing groups.

Wait, for example, if it's a ketone and an alcohol, that would fit O= in the carbonyl and -OH in the alcohol. So that would mean two oxygen atoms. So the formula would have two oxygen atoms. Looking at the options, options A and C have two oxygen atoms.

So possible formulas now are A and C.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which means a double bond. So DoU counts for that as one, and if another DoU comes from a ring or a carbonyl.

Wait, if the carbonyl is present, that's another DoU. So two DoU in total.

So let me check the DoU again.

If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), DoU is 2. That would account for, say, a double bond (1) and a ring (1), or a double bond and a carbonyl (another 1), or a ring and a carbonyl.

Wait, but if the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond, that's two DoU. So that would fit with option C.

But the FTIR shows a peak at 1700 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. And a peak at 1650, which could be the alkene.

So the molecule has both a carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, etc.) and a double bond.

So for the formula to have two oxygen atoms (as in options A and C), and to have DoU of 2.

Wait, option A is C6H12O2. DoU is (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So only one DoU. But the molecule has a carbonyl (1 DoU) and an alkene (another DoU), which would require two DoU. So that formula might not fit. Unless the compound has a ring and a carbonyl, but that would still be two DoU. Wait, wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = [(2*6 +2) - 12 - 0 ] / 2 = (14 -12)/2 = 2/2 =1.

So one DoU.

But if the compound has a double bond (one DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU), that would be two DoU, which can't fit with a formula that only allows one. So that would mean the formula can't have both. So that would imply that the compound can't have both a double bond and a carbonyl group if the formula is A.

But the IR and NMR data suggest both are present. So maybe that eliminates option A. So the correct formula must be C6H10O2 (option C) or another option.

Wait, let's look at option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (14 -10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could accommodate a double bond (one) and a carbonyl (another), which fits the data.

So the structure could be something like a substituted ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, but then the aromatic ring would account for the 1650 cm^-1 peak. But then, an aromatic ring counts as 4 DoU (for benzene), but I don't have that here. So perhaps it's an alkene and a carbonyl.

So the structure could be something like a ketone with a double bond.

Now, the Mass Spec. The fragment peak at m/z 45. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 is (CH2)2O, which is 24 (from two CH2 groups) plus 16 (O) = 40? No, 2*CH2 is 2*(14) = 28? Wait, CH2 is 14 (12 C, 2 H). So (CH2)2O would be 14*2 +16 = 28+16=44. Hmm, that's 44. Hmm. So maybe another approach.

What about a fragment like CH3COO- which would be 60? No. Alternatively, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is 91. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. If the molecule has a (CH2)2CO group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion breaks into a smaller fragment. Let me think about possible structures.

If the formula is C6H10O2, what could the structure be? Maybe an ester with a double bond. For example, something like methyl vinyl ester. Let's imagine a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3? But wait, that would be more carbons. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with an ester group. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, the mass spec fragment at 45. Let me think about what fragments give 45. Let's list possible fragments:

- (CH3)2CO is 58 (since (CH3)2CO is 2*(15) +12 +16= 30+12+16=58? Wait, no, (CH3)2CO is (2*15) + (12 + 16) = 30 + 28 =58. So that's m/z 58.

- CH2CH2O would be 44 (as before).

Wait, 45 is a bit tricky. Let me think of another approach. Another possible fragment is OCH2CH2O, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe a COO- group. Wait, the molecular weight of COO- is 44 (12+16+16=44). So if the fragment is [COOCH2CH3]^+ or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. For example, if the compound is something like cyclopentanone with an ester group, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula can be deduced from the possible fragments. Let's consider the molecular formula is C6H10O2.

So the molecular weight would be (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) =72 +10 +32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114.

But the fragment is at 45. Let me see, 114 -45=69. So maybe that's a cleavage. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is an ethylene oxide group (if O is present), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 45 is from a (CH2)2O group, but that would be 44 as I thought earlier.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. So molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32 =72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at 114.

If there's a fragment at 45, that suggests a loss or a break. Let's see: 114-45=69. Maybe a loss of 69, but I'm not sure what that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 comes from a different part. Maybe a methyl group attached to something else. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the compound is a methyl ester of a substituted propenoic acid. Let's say something like CH2=CHCOOCH3. Wait, the formula for that would be C5H8O2. But our options are C6H10O2, which is six carbons. So maybe it's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's see: C (3 in the acid, 2 in the ester) makes 5, so perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted ester. Let me think: Maybe something like CH2CH2O in the structure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the mass spec part. Let me go back to the other data.

The FTIR has a broad O-H peak, which is probably an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the presence of a carbonyl suggests ester (if O is present two times) or ketone (but then another O needed for the O-H). Wait, if it's a ketone and an alcohol, that would require two O's. So the formula must have two O's, which brings us to options A and C.

But earlier I thought that option A (C6H12O2) has only one DoU, which would be insufficient for both a carbonyl and a double bond. So option C (C6H10O2) has two DoU, which fits.

So the structure likely has both a double bond and a carbonyl group, contributing two DoU, and has two oxygen atoms.

So now, thinking about the mass spec. Let's imagine the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Possible structures include esters, ketones with O-H, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester with an alkene. For example, an ester like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2O... No, wait, perhaps the structure is something like methyl vinyl ester, but methyl vinyl ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let me check the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH3 is C5H8O2. But our formula is C6H10O2. So maybe it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Suppose it's a gamma or delta lactone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene, so the structure has an alkene and a carbonyl.

So possible structures could be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, CH2=CHCOOR, where R is something like CH2CH3.

Wait, the formula would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: 2 (from CH2=CH-) + 3 (from COO-) + 2 (from CH2CH3) = 7. That's C7, but our options are C6. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a ring. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. But I'm not very familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene. So perhaps the structure is something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Such a structure would have a conjugated double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, which would explain the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1.

In such a case, the IR would show the carbonyl at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (C=C) at 1650. That fits.

For the formula C6H10O2: Let's see, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have the structure RCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2... Wait, perhaps something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3? That would have 7 carbons, but our options are 6. Alternatively, maybe the ester is a methyl ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH3. That's five carbons, but again, our formula is six.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester, like a gamma lactone, which would have a ring. But that might not necessarily give a fragment of 45.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the structure is something like methyl propenoate, but that's again five carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible molecular formula. C6H10O2.

If the structure is an ester with a double bond, perhaps it's a six-carbon molecule where the ester group is part of the chain. For example, CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. That would be 6 carbons (3 in the acid part, 3 in the ester part). But wait, that would have a double bond somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's count: CH2=CH (2 carbons), CH2COO (3 carbons), CH2CH3 (2 carbons). Wait, that's 2 +3 +2 =7, which is too many.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH3CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. That's a six-carbon ester, but it doesn't have a double bond. So that wouldn't explain the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR.

Hmm, maybe the structure is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. That would have a ring (DoU 1), a double bond (DoU 1), and the ester (O's). So the formula would be C6H10O2. That's possible.

In that case, the mass spec fragment at 45 could come from a part of the ring. For example, perhaps the ring breaks into a smaller fragment. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the ester group. For example, the ester group (O-CO-O-) could break down into smaller fragments. The ester functional group is O-CO-O. If the ester breaks off, maybe the COO group could fragment into COO- (44), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group or similar.

Wait, but the fragment is at 45, which is a bit higher than 44. Maybe it's a CH2CH2O group (44), but that's not 45. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3CH2O group, which would be 45 (15 (CH3) + 16 (O) + 14 (CH2?) Wait, no. CH3CH2O would be (15) + (14) +16=45? Wait, 15 is for CH3 (12 +3*1), 14 is CH2 (12 +2*1), and O is 16. So 15 +14 +16=45? Wait, 15+14 is 29, plus 16 is 45. Oh, wait, but that's (CH3CH2O)+, which would have a mass of 45. So that's possible.

If the structure has an OCH2CH3 group, then perhaps during fragmentation, that group breaks off, giving a peak at 45. So the molecule could have an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), which would contribute to that fragment.

Putting all this together, the formula is likely C6H10O2 (option C).

Wait, but let me double-check.

FTIR: O-H (broad) suggests either alcohol or acid. The carbonyl at 1700 cm^-1 suggests an ester, ketone, etc. The 1650 cm^-1 could be an alkene.

NMR: Vinyl protons present, so an alkene is there.

Mass spec: fragment at 45 suggests OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) breaking off, which would come from an ester (RCO-OCH2CH3), so the ethoxy group would be the 45 fragment.

So the structure could be an ester where the ethyl ester group breaks off as OCH2CH3, giving m/z 45.

So the formula would be RCO-OCH2CH3, where R is a four-carbon group with a double bond. Wait, but that would be R being CH2CHCH2-? No, let me think again.

Wait, the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If the ester is OCH2CH3 (2 carbons), then the acid part would be RCOO-, which is (6-2-2) =2 carbons. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the ester is RCOOR', where R' is ethyl (2 carbons). So RCOO would be (6-2) =4 carbons. So R would be 3 carbons with a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: CH2=CH (2), CH2COO (3), CH2CH3 (2). Total 2+3+2=7. No, that's too many.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's think again.

The ester group is O-CO-O. The ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, which is 2 carbons. So the acid part (RCOO-) must be 4 carbons (since total is 6; 6-2=4). So R would be a 3-carbon group, but wait, RCOO is 4 carbons (R is 3 carbons), because RCOO is R + COO. So R would have 3 carbons.

Wait, RCOO is 4 carbons. So R is 3 carbons. So the acid part is RCOO-, which is 4 carbons, and the ester is OCH2CH3 (2 carbons), making 6. So R is 3 carbons, with a double bond, perhaps.

So R would be CH2CH=CH2. Wait, but that's 3 carbons with a double bond. So the acid would be CH2CH=CHCOO-. Wait, that's 4 carbons, but CH2CH=CHCOO- is 4 carbons, yes.

So the structure would be CH2CH=CHCOOCH2CH3.

Let me count the carbons: CH2 (1), CH (2), CH (3), COO (4), CH2 (5), CH3 (6). So 6 carbons. Hydrogens: Let's see, CH2CH=CHCOOCH2CH3.

Breaking it down:

- CH2: 2 H
- CH=CH: each CH has 1 H (but double bond reduces H)
- COO: O's don't contribute H here.
- CH2CH3: 2 and 3 H.

Wait, maybe it's better to count all H.

The structure is CH2CH=CHCOOCH2CH3.

Structure: CH2-CH2-CH2-COO-CH2-CH3? No, I think that's not right. Wait, the correct structure would be CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, that's five carbons for the acid part? No, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let me count:

CH2=CH (2 carbons), CH2COO (2 more, making 4), and CH2CH3 (2, making 6). So that's 2 (from CH2=CH) + 2 (CH2COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) =6. So the formula would be C6H10O2.

Let me check the H count:

CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3.

Each CH2=CH group: has 3 H (since double bond has two H on each CH). Wait, structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH-... No, I think I need to be precise.

The structure is CH2=CH-CH2-COO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, each CH2 group has 2 H, the CH=CH has 2 H each? Wait, maybe better to count:

Each CH2=CH group: the first CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 2 H (since it's double bonded to another CH which has 2 H). Wait, perhaps I'm complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is C6H10O2, which fits with the data.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


To determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we analyze the spectroscopic data provided:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- A strong absorption peak at **1700 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), such as in an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid.
- A peak at **1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated double bond (C=C) or an aromatic ring.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicates the presence of an alkene (C=C).

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the presence of an ethoxy group (OCH₂CH₃), which fragments during the analysis.

### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):
The formula is determined using the DoU formula:  
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H - X + N)}{2}
\]
Assuming no halogens (X) or nitrogen (N), the DoU for each option is calculated as follows:
- **C₆H₁₂O**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2(6) + 2 - 12)}{2} = \frac{14 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]
  This formula allows for either one ring or one double bond, but not both a carbonyl and an alkene.

- **C₆H₁₀O**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2(6) + 2 - 10)}{2} = \frac{14 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]
  This formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation, such as one ring and one double bond or one carbonyl and one double bond.

- **C₆H₁₀O₂**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2(6) + 2 - 10)}{2} = \frac{14 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]
  This formula also allows for two degrees of unsaturation, which could correspond to one carbonyl and one double bond.

- **C₆H₁₂O₂**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2(6) + 2 - 12)}{2} = \frac{14 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]
  Similar to C₆H₁₂O, this formula only allows for one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to explain the presence of both a carbonyl and an alkene.

### Conclusion:
The FTIR data indicates the presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene (C=C), requiring two degrees of unsaturation. The mass spectrometry data suggests the presence of an ethoxy group (OCH₂CH₃), which fragments at m/z = 45. The formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all the given data:
- It has two degrees of unsaturation, accounting for the carbonyl and alkene.
- The ethoxy group (OCH₂CH₃) explains the fragment at m/z = 45.

Thus, the correct chemical formula is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

Answer: C
