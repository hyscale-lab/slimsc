--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that in such models, the molecule's energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. The question is about finding the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when it's in its fundamental state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it must go to the next higher state. But wait, what does the next state mean here? Does it mean the next energy level overall, or the next in either rotation or vibration?

Oh, right, the molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state would have the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0, but wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational quantum number starts at J=0, but the ground state might be J=1 or higher? Or maybe it's J=0 as the ground state. Wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and the selection rules allow transitions when the photon imparts the right energy. But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state, and the lowest rotational state. So the next state would be the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But I think in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both, so the next state would be one where either the vibrational quantum number increases, or the rotational, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but the question is about the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. That would be the one where the energy required is the least. So I need to compute the energy required to go from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to either the next vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or the next rotational state (v=0, J=1). Whichever requires less energy is probably the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's energy levels are such that the first transition is a vibrational one, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the energies involved.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia, and J is the rotational quantum number. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, so E_fundamental = (1/2) h w (since for v=0, E_vib is (1/2) h w, and E_rot is 0 when J=0).

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the vibrational energy levels are typically given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So for v=0, E_vib = (1/2) h w. The rotational energy for J=0 is zero, so the total energy is (1/2) h w.

Now, the next possible states would be either increasing v by 1 (v=1) with J=0, or increasing J by 1 (J=1) with v=0, or any combination, but which one has a lower energy difference.

Let me compute the energy differences for both transitions.

First, transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0: the change in energy is the difference between E_vib for v=1 and E_vib for v=0. So delta E1 = ( (1 + 1/2) h w ) - (1/2 h w ) = h w. The rotational part remains the same (J=0), so no change there.

Second, transition from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1: the change in energy is the difference between E_rot for J=1 and E_rot for J=0.

E_rot for J=0 is 0. For J=1, E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) * 1*(1+1) = (ħ² / 2I)*2 = (ħ² / I).

So delta E2 = (ħ² / I) - 0 = ħ² / I.

Which of these two, delta E1 or delta E2, is smaller? That's the next state.

So I need to compute both delta E1 and delta E2 and see which is smaller.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, but perhaps that's a detail about the rotor being treated as non-rigid, but perhaps not affecting this calculation.

So let's compute delta E1 and delta E2.

First, delta E1 is simply h w. Given that w is 4e14 rad/s, h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J s). So:

delta E1 = h * w = (6.626e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, delta E2 is (ħ^2)/(I), where ħ is h/(2π), and I is the moment of inertia.

The moment of inertia I is given by I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The reduced mass μ is (m_x m_y)/(m_x + m_y). The masses are given as Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But we need to convert that to kilograms. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = (3.02e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is h/(2π) = (6.626e-34 J s) / (6.2832) ≈ 1.047e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.047e-34)^2 ≈ 1.097e-68 J² s².

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Wait, but when we compute ħ² / I, the units will be in J s² / kg m².

Wait, let me compute delta E2:

delta E2 = ħ² / I = (1.112e-68 J² s²) / (1.208e-46 kg m²).

Wait, but wait, J is kg m²/s², so J² is kg² m^4 / s^4.

So ħ² has units of (J s)^2, which is (kg² m² s^0) → kg² m² / s^0. Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of units.

Let me think in terms of the actual calculation:

delta E2 = (ħ²) / I.

ħ has units of J s, and I is kg m², so ħ² is (J s)^2 = (kg² m^4 / s^2) * s² = kg² m^4 / s^0? Wait, no, J is kg m²/s². So J s is kg m²/s. Then J² s² is (kg² m^4)/(s^2) * s² = kg² m^4.

So ħ² is (kg² m^4), I is kg m². So ħ² / I has units kg m². Hmm, but that can't be right because energy should have units of J (kg m²/s²). Wait, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, let me think again. The correct formula for E_rot is (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1). So when J increases by 1, the energy increases by (ħ²/(2I)) * (2J+1). For J=0 to J=1, the change is from 0 to 2*(1)(2)=2. So delta E2 = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate delta E2.

E_rot(J) = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1).

So delta E2 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = (ħ²/(2I)) * (1*2) - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So yes, delta E2 is ħ²/(I).

So delta E2 = (ħ²) / I.

So let's compute that.

I = 1.208e-46 kg m².

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So delta E2 = (1.112e-68) / (1.208e-46) = (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, wait, 1.112e-68 divided by 1.208e-46 is 1.112/1.208 * 1e-22. Let me compute 1.112 / 1.208 ≈ 0.920.

So approximately 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier, delta E1 was about 2.65e-19 J, which is way bigger than delta E2. So the next state is the one where J increases from 0 to 1. Therefore, the photon must provide an energy equal to delta E2, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 9.2e-23 J is way smaller than delta E1. So the molecule is in the fundamental state where J=0 and v=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be J=1, v=0. So the photon's energy should be delta E2.

So the photon's energy is equal to delta E2, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But the question is about the momentum of the photon. Wait, photons don't have momentum directly, but their momentum is related to their energy and speed. Since photons travel at the speed of light, their momentum p is equal to E/c, where c is the speed of light.

So p = E_photon / c.

But wait, E_photon is delta E2, which is 9.2e-23 J.

Speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are close to that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, all options are in Ns, which is kg m/s. So 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s.

Wait, but my calculation gives 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is way smaller than the options given. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere. Let me re-examine the calculations.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula for delta E2. Let's re-calculate delta E2.

I think I might have made a mistake in calculating ħ² / I.

Wait, let's recompute ħ².

ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2. Or in terms of kg^2 m^4/s²? Wait, J is kg m²/s², so (J·s) is kg m²/s. So ħ^2 is kg² m^4/s².

I is in kg m². So when I divide ħ² by I, I get (kg² m^4/s²) / (kg m²) )= kg m²/s², which is J. So the units are correct.

So delta E2 = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46) = ?

Wait, 1.0545718e-34 squared is (1.0545718)^2 = about 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Divided by 1.208e-46 kg m²: 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ ~0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So photon's energy E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p_photon = E / c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But all the options are in the order of 1e-27 Ns (kg m/s), which is way larger than this.

So this suggests that perhaps the transition is not a rotational one but a vibrational one. That would make delta E1 = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, 8.83e-28 kg m/s is 8.83e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy delta E2.

Wait, let me recompute I. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

Masses: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

Reduced mass μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 = 1.81818... amu.

Yes, correct.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.81818 amu = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.02. So 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = (3.02e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m². Correct.

So the calculation seems correct. So delta E2 is 9.2e-23 J, which would give p_photon = 3.07e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than the options given.

So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, and the next state is (v=1, J=0), which would require delta E1= h w= 2.65e-19 J. So p_photon= 8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is 8.83e-28 Ns. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of that. Hmm, not matching exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the model allows for simultaneous changes in both vibrational and rotational states, but the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one with the least delta E.

Wait, but according to my calculations, delta E2 (rotational) is much smaller than delta E1 (vibrational), so the next state would be the rotational transition.

But then the photon's momentum would be in the order of 3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of delta E2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the correct delta E2 again.

Wait, let's compute ħ²/(2I) * (J+1)(J+2) - ... No, earlier, I think I did it correctly. Wait, when J=0, E_rot=0. When J=1, E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2. So delta E2 is (ħ²/(2I)) *2 = ħ^2 / I.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using a different formula. Oh wait, perhaps the formula I used is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia. Let me recheck:

I = μ R². μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, and R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = (1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating I: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = 3.02e-27 kg. (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m². Correct.

So delta E2 is (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46) = let's compute it more accurately.

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 = approximately 1.112e-68.

1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 *1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, so delta E2 is 9.2e-23 J. Then, p_photon = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are all about 1e-27 Ns or larger, which is way bigger.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of delta E2. Wait, perhaps I should have considered that J can't be zero for the rotation? Wait, J can be zero, but perhaps the selection rule for rotation is ΔJ=±2, so perhaps a transition from J=0 to J=1 is not allowed? But the question doesn't specify selection rules, so perhaps any transition is allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But according to the energy levels, the J=1 state is lower in energy than the v=1 state. So the photon needed would be for the rotational transition.

But that would give a very small p_photon, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that delta E2 is smaller than delta E1.

Wait, let me compute delta E1 and delta E2 more precisely.

delta E1 = h * w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

delta E2 = ħ^2/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46) = ?

Compute (1.0545718e-34)^2: 1.0545718^2 is about 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Divided by 1.208e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = 9.2e-23 J.

So yes, delta E1 is about 2.65e-19 J, delta E2 is 9.2e-23 J. So the next state is J=1, v=0. So the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J, and its momentum p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are that small.

Wait, perhaps I confused the selection rules. Maybe the molecule can't transition from J=0 to J=1 because the selection rule for rotational transitions is ΔJ=±1 or ±2, but perhaps in some cases, but wait, I think for rigid rotors, ΔJ=±1. But even so, that would allow J=0 → J=1.

Alternatively, perhaps the model here treats the molecule as a non-rigid rotor, but I'm not sure how that affects the energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me compute I again.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

μ is (20 * 2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 1.81818... amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.6605 ≈ 3.02. So 3.02e-27 kg.

I = μ R² =3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg m². Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if the formula for rotational energy is correct. Wait, the rotational energy is given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So when J=1, E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

So yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the quantum rotation-vibration model in the way I thought. Maybe it's a different model where the energy levels are purely vibrational or rotational. Or maybe the question is only considering the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the photon to cause a change in both vibrational and rotational states, but that would complicate things.

Wait, let me think about the problem again. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. It absorbs a photon, and goes to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest increase in energy, which is either v=1, J=0 (delta E1) or v=0, J=1 (delta E2). Since delta E2 is smaller, as we saw, the photon's energy is delta E2, so the momentum is E/c, which is 9.2e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Wait, so 3e-31 is way smaller than the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the fundamental state includes both vibrational and rotational contributions. The next state could be the first excited state, which could be either a higher vibrational or higher rotational state. But which one requires the least energy.

But according to our calculations, the rotational state requires less energy to transition to.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of delta E2. Let me recompute it more accurately.

Compute ħ^2/(2I) * 2 (since J goes from 0 to 1, so J=1, J(J+1)=2).

Wait, E_rot(J=1) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So delta E2 is ħ²/I.

Let me compute ħ and I again.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

I = 1.208e-46 kg m².

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Divide by I: 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = 9.2e-23 J.

Yes.

So, perhaps the problem is that the photon's momentum is being considered as p = h bar * k, but that might not be the case.

Wait, but the energy of the photon is E = h f, and the momentum is p = E / c = (h f) / c = h/(c) f.

But since f = w/(2π), because angular frequency w = 2π f.

So, E_photon = h w/(2π).

Wait, no, wait: the angular frequency w is related to f by w = 2π f. So f = w/(2π).

So E_photon = h * f = h * (w/(2π)) ) = h w/(2π) = ħ w.

Wait, but earlier, I thought E_photon is equal to delta E, which is either delta E1 or delta E2.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the states. So for the rotational transition, E_photon = delta E2 = 9.2e-23 J.

But perhaps I should express the photon's momentum in terms of ħ and other constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the calculation of the photon's momentum based on the vibrational transition, which would give a larger momentum, matching the options.

So perhaps I should reevaluate the possibility that delta E is h w, and the photon's momentum is (h w)/(c).

So, h w = 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

So p = 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, which is approximately twice as small as this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w.

Wait, let me compute h w again:

h is approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

h * w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. Correct.

So p_photon = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But option A is 1.9e-28. Hmm, almost half. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should use exact values.

Compute h * w:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact as per SI units).

w =4e14 rad/s.

So 6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = 2.65042806e-19 J.

Then, p = 2.65042806e-19 / 2.99792458e8 m/s.

Wait, 3e8 is an approximation, but using 3e8 gives 8.83e-28.

Using more precise c=2.99792458e8 m/s:

p = 2.65042806e-19 / 2.99792458e8 ≈ 8.838e-28 Ns.

Still, the same as before.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the fundamental state, but the next state is the first excited vibrational state regardless of rotation. But that seems not the case, because the rotational transition requires less energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy with J=0 and v=1, but that's the same as the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy levels as a combination of both. The energy for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model is given by:

E = E_vib + E_rot.

E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w.

E_rot = (J (J +1) ) * ħ²/(2I).

So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0: E = (0.5) h w + 0.

The next state could be v=1, J=0: E = (1.5) h w.

Or v=0, J=1: E = 0.5 h w + (2 * ħ²)/(2I) )= 0.5 h w + ħ²/I.

So delta E for v=1, J=0 is (1.5 h w) - (0.5 h w) )= h w.

delta E for v=0, J=1 is (0.5 h w + ħ²/I) - (0.5 h w) )= ħ²/I.

So the next state is either one, whichever has lower delta E.

As per calculations, delta E_rot is 9.2e-23 J, which is much less than h w=2.65e-19 J, so the next state would be J=1, v=0.

But why are none of the options matching this?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me check if the formula is E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * (ħ^2)/(2I) ). Correct.

So when J=1, E_rot = 2 * (ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/I.

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if the reduced mass is correctly calculated.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) =40/22 = 1.81818 amu.

Yes. 1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 = approx 3.02e-27 kg.

Yes.

I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20= 1.208e-46 kg m².

Yes.

So delta E2 = ħ²/I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 /1.208e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is this, and its momentum is 9.2e-23 /3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are all about 1e-27 or higher. So perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, ignoring rotation.

In that case, the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns. But the closest option is A, 1.9e-28, which is about half of that.

Wait, wait, perhaps I forgot that the vibrational energy includes the zero-point energy, but the transition is from v=0 to v=1, so the delta is h w.

But perhaps the question is about the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0, which requires delta E1 = h w.

In that case, p_photon = 8.83e-28 Ns, but that's not among the options either.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum, but maybe in the calculation, I should have used the exact value of c.

Wait, let me recompute using c=2.99792e8 m/s.

p_photon = 2.650428e-19 J / 2.99792e8 m/s = 8.838e-28 kg m/s =8.838e-28 Ns.

Still, no option matches.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns. But why is it half of what I calculated?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition where both J and v change, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct delta E is actually higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute delta E2 using the vibrational frequency?

Wait, no, delta E2 is purely rotational.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the bond length in a different unit, like Bohr radius or something else, but no, the bond length is given as 2 angstroms.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the momentum imparted when a photon is absorbed, and considering the molecule's movement. Wait, no, the question is about the photon's momentum.

Wait, another approach: the photon's momentum p is h/(lambda), but since lambda = c/f, and f = w/(2pi), so lambda = 2pi c /w.

So p = h / (2 pi c /w ) )= (h w)/(2 pi c )= (h/(2 pi c )) * w.

But h/(2 pi) is ħ. So p= ħ w/(c).

Wait, but we're considering the energy delta E is either delta E1 or delta E2.

So for the vibrational transition, delta E1 = h w.

Photon's momentum would be p = h w/(c).

Which is 6.626e-34 *4e14 /3e8 = (2.65e-19) /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the photon's momentum using the rotational energy delta E2.

So, p_photon = delta E2 / c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the entire approach.

Alternative idea: Maybe the question is using the rigid rotor model, but considering that the moment of inertia is treated as R^2 (μ=1 for rigid rotor). No, because the problem states it's a non-rigid rotor.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the vibrational ground state, but the rotational ground state is J=1, not J=0. Because for a diatomic molecule, the rotational ground state J=0 may not be allowed due to the selection rule, but no, J=0 is allowed, and the selection rule for rotation is ΔJ=±1 (for rigid rotors), but in this case, the problem doesn't specify selection rules.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule can't have J=0 because of the bond length or other factors, but I think J=0 is allowed.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the energy of the photon as the sum of rotational and vibrational changes, but that would complicate things further.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is the sum needed to change both J and v in such a way that the total energy is minimized.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition and the rotational transition is ignored, which would imply that the correct answer is based on the vibrational transition.

But the options don't match that either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula for the energy levels.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model's energy levels: perhaps the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot. So the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), with E = (1/2) h w + 0.

The next state would be the one with the minimal increase in energy. So, the options are (v=1, J=0) with delta E = h w ≈ 2.65e-19 J, and (v=0, J=1) with delta E= (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I) ≈9.2e-23 J.

So the minimal delta E is 9.2e-23 J, so the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But this isn't an option, so perhaps I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mass differently. Wait, the masses are given as Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22=1.818 amu. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is in a different unit. The problem states R =2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula for the rotational energy.

Wait, another approach: rotational energy levels have E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant given by B = ħ²/(2I). So delta E for J=1 is 2B.

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2/(2*1.208e-46) = approximately (1.112e-68)/(2.416e-46) = ~4.6e-23 J.

So delta E2 = 2B = 9.2e-23 J. Correct.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, and momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the vibrational transition, and the rotational transition isn't considered because it's negligible or something.

In that case, the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns, which is option A:1.9e-28, but that's about a third of that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute h * w.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon= h w /c = 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.834e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.834e-28 Ns.

Hmm, option A is 1.9e-28, which is approximately a quarter of this value.

Wait, unless I'm supposed to use (hbar * w)/c.

Wait, p = ħ w / c.

Because E= ħ w, so p = E/c= ħ w /c.

But that would be (1.0545718e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (3e8 m/s) = (4.218e-20 J s rad) / (3e8 m/s) * (since 1 rad is dimensionless).

Wait, J s * rad/s → J s/(s) → J.

Wait, E= ħ w → p = E/c = (ħ w)/c.

So, compute:

(1.0545718e-34 J s) * (4e14 1/s) ) / (3e8 m/s ) = (4.218e-20 J) /3e8 m/s = 1.406e-28 kg m/s =1.406e-28 Ns.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

Ah, so perhaps this is the correct approach.

Wait, why would I use ħ w instead of h w? Because sometimes in quantum mechanics, the energy is expressed as E= ħ w. So when the photon's energy is ħ w, the momentum would be p= ħ w /c.

So, if the photon's energy is ħ w, then p= (hbar * w)/c.

In our case, w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So, p = (1.0545718e-34 *4e14) / 3e8.

Compute numerator: 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20.

Divide by 3e8: 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s =1.406e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D (1.4e-28 Ns).

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why would the photon's energy be ħ w instead of h w?

Ah, because in quantum mechanics, the energy levels are often expressed using ħ and frequency.

Wait, Planck's equation is E = h f, where f is the frequency. But angular frequency w = 2 pi f.

So E = h f = (h/(2 pi)) w = ħ w.

So, yes, E_photon = ħ w.

So in this case, the photon's energy is ħ w, so p_photon = ħ w /c.

So, that gives us option D.

But why would the molecule transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which requires delta E1 = h w.

But according to this approach, the photon's energy is ħ w, which is (6.626e-34 / 2pi) *4e14 ≈ (1.0545e-34 *4e14) =4.218e-20 J.

Wait, but delta E1 is h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

Which is much larger than ħ w=4.218e-20 J.

So, the photon's energy is 4.218e-20 J. So the molecule can't transition to v=1, J=0 because that requires 2.65e-19 J.

So perhaps the photon's energy is for a rotational transition.

Wait, but earlier calculation with delta E2=9.2e-23 J, and photon's momentum=3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't any option.

So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is ħ w, which is 4.218e-20 J, which would be the energy for a transition of delta E=4.218e-20 J. But delta E2 is 9.2e-23 J, which is much smaller.

So, perhaps the photon's energy is 4.218e-20 J, and the molecule transitions to a state where the energy increases by that amount. But according to our earlier calculation, delta E2 is 9.2e-23 J, which is much less than 4.2e-20 J. So the photon's energy is higher than delta E2, meaning that the molecule would transition to a higher state, perhaps J=1 and v=0 plus some vibrational energy.

But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

But given the options, the calculation using p = ħ w / c gives us option D:1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps that's the intended answer.


To determine the momentum of the photon that allows the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy levels of the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state \(v = 0\) and the lowest rotational state \(J = 0\). The goal is to identify the photon energy required to transition to the next state with the smallest energy increase.

### Key Calculations and Analysis

1. **Energy Levels**:
   - The vibrational energy levels are given by \(E_{\text{vib}} = (v + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega\), where \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\).
   - The rotational energy levels are given by \(E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)\), where \(I = \mu R^2\) is the moment of inertia, \(\mu\) is the reduced mass, and \(R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\).

2. **Fundamental State**:
   - The fundamental state is \(v = 0, J = 0\), with total energy \(E_{\text{fund}} = \frac{1}{2} h \omega + 0 = \frac{1}{2} h \omega\).

3. **Next State with Lowest Energy**:
   - The next possible states are:
     - \(v = 1, J = 0\): The energy increase is \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega\).
     - \(v = 0, J = 1\): The energy increase is \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}\), where \(I = \mu R^2\).
   - Comparing \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}}\) and \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}}\), the rotational transition requires less energy, making it the next state with the lowest energy.

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The energy of the photon must match the energy difference \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}\).
   - The reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \cdot 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting to kilograms, \(\mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\).
   - The moment of inertia is:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
     \]
   - The rotational energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Thus:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
     \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated momentum \(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the photon energy is instead assumed to correspond to the vibrational transition (\(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega\)), the momentum becomes:
     \[
     p = \frac{h \omega}{c} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s})}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
     This is also inconsistent with the options.

6. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Using the quantum mechanical relation \(E = \hbar \omega\), the photon momentum is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s})}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
     This matches option D.

### Conclusion

The most consistent answer with the provided options is obtained by assuming the photon energy corresponds to \(E = \hbar \omega\), leading to a momentum of \(p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\).

**Answer: D**
