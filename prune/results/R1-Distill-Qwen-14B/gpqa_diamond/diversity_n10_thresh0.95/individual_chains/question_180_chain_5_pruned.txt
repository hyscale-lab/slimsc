Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So all the particles are identical and have charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. So each is 2e.

Now, the setup: 12 charges are at a distance of 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is at the center, and all the others are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it.

So the system's potential energy is what we're after. Because in an isolated system, the minimum energy scenario is when the potential energy is minimized, right? Because potential energy relates to the work done to arrange the charges.

Wait, but wait. Potential energy in electric systems—when you have multiple charges, you calculate the potential energy by considering each pair. The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

So in this case, the 13th charge is at P, fixed. The other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is 2 meters away from the fixed charge.

But wait, the potential energy of the entire system would be the sum of all pairwise potentials. But wait, since the system is isolated, and each charge is placed in the potential created by others, right?

Wait, but in these kinds of problems, sometimes you can think of it as the sum of all the potential energies of each pair. But since the charges are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe we can find a formula for the total potential energy.

Wait, but for the 13th charge, it's fixed. So the potential at P due to all the 12 charges is each contributing a potential. The potential at P is the sum of potentials from each of the 12 charges.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P. So their contribution to the potential at P is V = k*(2e)/(2) = k*e. So the total potential at P is 12 times that.

Wait, but the potential energy of the 13th charge when it's placed at P is q times the potential at P before placing it. Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the potential at P is due to the 12 charges, and the 13th charge contributes to the potential of the others.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by calculating all the potential energies.

Each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of the system. So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Let me think: The 13th charge is fixed. Each of the other 12 charges is 2 meters away from P. So the distance between the 13th charge and any of the other 12 is 2 meters. So each of these 12 has a potential energy with the 13th charge of U1 = k*(2e)*(2e) / 2m.

Wait, but wait: q1 and q2 are both 2e. So U1 per pair is k*(2e)^2 / (2m).

But how many such pairs are there? 12, since there are 12 charges at 2m from P, each interacting with the 13th charge.

So the total for these interactions is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, but wait, but in potential energy, when you consider all pairs, each pair is considered once. But in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, so when the 12 charges are placed, each is placed in the field of the 13th and the others. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the total potential energy is the sum of all the potential energies of each pair. So each pair consists of two charges. The 13th charge and each of the 12 contributes, and the 12 charges also contribute among themselves.

Wait, because each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. But what is the distance between any two of the 12 charges? Hmm, that depends on how they're arranged. If they're all on a sphere of radius 2m, then the distance between any two would be determined by the angle between them. But wait, in the minimal energy case, perhaps they are arranged in a way that the distances between them are maximized? Or minimized? Wait, but for potential energy, the arrangement affects the distances between the 12 charges.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed on the surface of the sphere. So the distance between any two of the 12 charges is determined by their positions on the sphere.

Hmm, but to find the potential energy between each pair of the 12, I need to calculate the distance between them. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that all the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere, so the average distance between any two is... Wait, but that complicates things.

Wait, but maybe the question is considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 moving charges, and not the potential energy between the 12 moving charges themselves. Oh, but that can't be right because the potential energy of the entire system includes all interactions.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of:

1. The potential energy between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges (each at 2m). Each of these contributes U1 = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total for this part is 12 * 2k e²/(2m) ... Wait, no: wait, k*(2e)*(2e)/r, where r is 2m. So for each pair, U = (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m). So 2e is the charge for each, and r is 2m.

So each U1 is (k * 4e²) / (2m) = 2k e²/(m). And there are 12 such pairs, so 12 * 2k e²/(m) = 24k e²/(m).

Wait, but wait, when you have a system of multiple charges, the potential energy between a pair is considered once. Wait, but in this scenario, the 13th charge is fixed. So when the 12 charges are placed at 2m, each contributes a potential to the 13th. But the 13th contributes a potential to each of the 12 as well.

Wait, but in the formula, U = k q1 q2 / r. So each pair (13th and any of the 12) contributes U1 = k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = 4k e²/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

So 12 such pairs, so 12 * 2k e²/m = 24k e²/m.

But wait, that's only the potential energy between the 13th and the 12. What about the potential energy between the 12 charges among themselves?

Ah, right, that's another part. Because all the 12 are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances vary. So each pair among the 12 contributes some potential energy.

But calculating that would require knowing the distance between each pair of those 12 charges. But that's complicated because it depends on how they're arranged on the sphere.

Wait, but maybe in the minimal energy configuration, the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, forming a regular icosahedron or something. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges, which would be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and not the mutual energy of the 12.

But that seems unlikely. Because in reality, the potential energy of the entire system would include all interactions. However, perhaps the problem is designed such that the 12 charges are so arranged that their mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the other terms, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are fixed on the sphere, so their positions are fixed, and their mutual potential energy is a constant. But then, for finding the minimum energy, perhaps the mutual energy is not contributing, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to the 13th charge and the 12, not the mutual energy of the 12. Let me see.

Wait, the question asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimal energy is achieved when the potential energy is as low as possible. Since potential energy is minimized when the system is as stable as possible, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but let me think about the formula for the potential energy of a system of charges. The total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs (i < j) of U_ij, where U_ij = (k q_i q_j) / r_ij.

In this problem:

- The 13th charge is fixed at P. Let's call it charge Q = 2e.

- The other 12 charges are each q = 2e, at a distance of 2m from P. So for each of the 12 charges, the distance from Q is r = 2m.

So the potential energy between Q and each of the 12 is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2 k e²/m.

So for 12 such interactions, that's 12 * 2 k e²/m = 24 k e²/m.

Now, the other part is the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Each pair is two charges, each of 2e, separated by some distance r_ij.

But wait, how far apart are these 12 charges? Since they're all constrained to be 2m from P, the distance between any two depends on their position on the sphere around P.

Wait, but without knowing their exact arrangement, I can't compute the exact value. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe the question expects us to ignore this part, but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. No, that's not possible unless they're arranged in a certain way, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed at that radius. So the only thing contributing to the potential energy is the placement of each of the 12 charges in the field of the 13th charge.

Wait, if that's the case, then perhaps the mutual potential energy among the 12 is considered as a constant and thus not part of the minimum energy calculation. But I'm not confident about this.

Wait, but the problem states that the system is isolated. So perhaps we need to consider all interactions.

Wait, but the initial approach should be to calculate all the potential energies.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of:

1. The potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 (12 terms).

2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges (combinations of 12 taken 2 at a time, so 66 terms).

But without knowing the distances between the 12 charges, perhaps the problem is expecting us to ignore this second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the other terms, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would be a different scenario, but not in this case.

Wait, another thought: The 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each at 2m away. The potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is positive because both are positive charges (since each is 2e). So each contributes a positive U. The mutual potential energy between the 12 charges would also be positive because they're all positive. So the total U would be the sum of all these positive contributions.

But the question asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps what we're being asked is the potential energy of the system when the 13th charge is placed, considering only its interactions with the 12, but not the mutual interactions of the 12.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the potential energy of the 13th charge, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: When you fix a charge and bring other charges into place, the work done is equal to the potential energy. So when placing each of the 12 charges, you have to do work against the electric field created by the fixed charge and the other charges already placed.

But in that case, the potential energy would include both the fixed charge's influence and the mutual influence among the 12.

But this seems complicated, especially without knowing the exact arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a standard problem where the potential energy is calculated between the fixed charge and all the others, and the mutual potential energy among the 12 is neglected.

If that's the case, then the calculation is straightforward.

So let's compute that part.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e, the fixed charge is 2e, and the distance is 2m.

Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4k e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

There are 12 such pairs, so 12 * 2k e²/m = 24 k e²/m.

Wait, but wait, no. Because each charge is placed in the field of the fixed charge, but the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is the same, so we can calculate it as 12 times that.

But wait, Coulomb's law for potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. So for each pair, it's k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

So 12 pairs give 24 k e² / m.

But wait, the value of m in the denominator is 2, right? Because the distance is 2 meters. So 24 k e² / (2 m) ?

Wait no, it's 24 * (k e² * 4) / (2m) ?

Wait no, no. Let me recalculate.

Wait, each pair (the 13th and any of the 12) has charges 2e each, and distance 2m.

So U per pair is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ) = (4 k e²) / (2m) = 2 k e² / m.

So for 12 such pairs, the total is 12 * 2 k e² / m = 24 k e² / m.

So that's the first part.

Now, the second part is the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Each pair of these 12 charges are separated by some distance r_ij, but without their exact positions, it's difficult to calculate.

But perhaps the problem is only considering the first part (the interactions with the fixed charge), and the mutual interactions are neglected.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and 12, and not the mutual. However, that seems unlikely because the mutual potential energy is definitely part of the system's total energy.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual potential energy is zero. For example, if they are arranged symmetrically, perhaps their contributions cancel out. But that's not the case because all are positive charges, so their mutual repulsion would contribute a positive potential energy.

Wait, but in reality, the mutual potential energy among the 12 would be positive. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the two parts: the 24 k e²/m from the fixed charge, plus the sum of all the mutual pairs.

But without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero. But that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being considered as a negligible part, but that's not stated.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is the sum of the interactions between the fixed charge and the 12 charges. Let's compute that.

First, let's compute the value.

Given:

k = 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

e = elementary charge = 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

Each charge is 2e, so 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

Distance between fixed charge and each of the 12 is 2 meters.

So for each pair, U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) = (4 k e²) / (2m) ) = 2 k e²/m.

Wait, no: each charge is 2e, so (2e) * (2e) = 4e². Divided by 2m, so 4e²/(2m) = 2e²/m.

So each pair contributes U = 2 k e² / (2m) ?

Wait, wait, let's recompute:

Wait, no:

Wait, U = k * (2e) * (2e) / r, where r is 2 m.

So U = k * 4 e² / 2 m = (4 k e²) / (2 m) = 2 k e² / m.

So each of the 12 charges contributes U_i = 2 k e²/m.

So the total for the 12 interactions is 12 * (2 k e²/m) = 24 k e²/m.

Wait,
