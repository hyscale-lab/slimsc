Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully again.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it forms its conjugate base, acetate. The pH changes depend on the point in the titration.

First, I should probably find out the concentrations after dilution. Let's see, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The moles of acetic acid initially would be Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. When we dilute it to 40 cm³, the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but when we titrate this with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, as I calculated. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence would be moles / molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So at equivalence, we add 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Let me think about that.

Wait, no, 25% of the way to equivalence. So in the titration, 25% of the required volume has been added. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

So for the 25% point, let's calculate how much acetic acid has been neutralized. Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1, this neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so after adding NaOH, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The acetate produced is 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but wait, when diluting with water, the total volume is 40 cm³. Then when adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³. So the concentrations of the species will be these moles divided by 0.0425 L.

So for the 25% point:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's calculate that. 0.00075 is 7.5e-4. Divided by 0.0425 L is approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is approximately 1.85 x 10^-5. The log of 1.85 is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733, so pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Let me compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. The log of 1/3 is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, that's around 4.26.

Wait, what about the equivalence point? At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion is a weak base.

The moles of acetate at equivalence are the same as the initial moles of acetic acid, which was 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M, so let's set up the expression.

Let x be the [OH^-] produced. The Kb expression is Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11.

Taking square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 9.02. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, when we reach equivalence point, the solution is CH3COO^- in water. The moles are 0.001, and the volume is 50 cm³ (40 +10).

Wait, yes, 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Calculating Kb again: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 → 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The expression: Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, as before.

So [OH^-] = ~1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH ≈9.02.

But looking at the options, the equivalence points are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92.

Hmm, none match 9.02. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial calculations. Let me go back.

Wait, in the equivalence point calculation, perhaps I should consider the dilution more accurately.

Wait, at equivalence, the solution is CH3COO^- Na+ in water. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so after neutralization, we have 0.001 moles of acetate.

The total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the Kb or the calculation. Let me calculate Kb again.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5 → pKa is about 4.733.

Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → 1e-9 / 1.85 → approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So in the solution, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. So the Kb expression:

5.405e-10 = (x^2)/(0.02 - x).

Assuming x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so 4.983 → pOH ≈4.98, pH = 14-4.98=9.02.

But the options don't have 9.02. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in an earlier step. Let me check the initial dilution.

Wait, initial acetic acid is 0.05 M, 20 cm³. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Diluted with 20 cm³ water, so total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³. Correct.

Wait, but when we reach equivalence, the solution is acetate, which is a weak base. But perhaps I forgot to account for the dilution correctly. Or maybe I should use the hydrolysis calculation differently.

Another approach: perhaps the solution is 0.02 M acetate. Let me calculate pH using the formula for a weak base.

The formula is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) but wait, at equivalence, HA is zero, but that's not the case. Wait, no. At equivalence, all the HA is converted to A^-. So the solution is a solution of A^-.

But maybe I should calculate the pH using the hydrolysis:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So, initial concentration: 0.02 M.

Change: -x → +x, +x.

At equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 -x, [CH3COOH]=x, [OH^-] = x.

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH =4.98 → pH=9.02. But again, none of the options have 9.02.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the Kb.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 → Let me compute this accurately.

1.85e-5 is 0.0000185. 1e-14 divided by 0.0000185 = ?

Let me compute 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ) = (1e-14) * (1/(1.85e-5)) ) → 1e-14 * (5.405e4) ) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

So same result. So why do the options not have 9.02? Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of these options have an equivalence pH of ~9. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the equivalence point wrong. Maybe the equivalence pH isn't as high as I thought. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: since the solution is a buffer before equivalence, but at equivalence, it's a solution of the conjugate base. But maybe I did the initial moles wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Diluted to 40 cm³: 0.001 / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, volume needed for equivalence is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³.

So at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate, and the solution is 0.02 M acetate.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the dilution again. The total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³. So 0.05 L. 0.001 mol / 0.05 L =0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, but that gives pH around 9, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the pH at equivalence. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using a different approach.

Wait, wait, another thought. Could it be that when I'm at 25% titration, the solution is not a buffer anymore? No, wait, 25% of the way to equivalence would be a buffer, as not all of the acid has been neutralized.

Wait, let me recheck the 25% titration calculation.

At 25% titration, we've added 25% of the required volume (10 cm³) → 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Moles NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So this neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid.

So remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 =0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³ =0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 /0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 /0.0425≈0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH= pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )

pKa is 4.733.

[acetate]/[acetic acid] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH =4.733 -0.477 ≈4.256 → around 4.26. Which matches option A's first value.

But the equivalence point in my calculation is 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake and the correct approach gives a lower equivalence pH.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I forgot to account for the dilution correctly in the equivalence point.

Wait, when I reach equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M acetate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the solution after mixing all the volumes, but maybe I made a miscalculation in the hydrolysis.

Wait, another way to calculate pH at equivalence: Using the formula for a weak base solution.

The concentration is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The OH- concentration x comes from the equation Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) → as before.

But maybe there's another approach, like using the approximation without assuming x is negligible.

Wait, let's not make the approximation. Let me write the equation.

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x)

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x)

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) = (2.92e-19) ) + (4.324e-11) ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Since x must be positive, take the positive root:

x= [6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ] / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH-] ≈3.288e-6 → pOH= 5.484 → pH=8.516.

Ah! So that's around 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

Wait, but why did I get a different result when I didn't assume x was negligible? Because in reality, x isn't negligible compared to 0.02.

Wait, let me check the x value from the quadratic: 3.288e-6.

Compare that to 0.02 M. 3.288e-6 is 0.0003288% of 0.02, so it's negligible. Wait, but that can't be because the x is 3.288e-6 and 0.02 is 2e-2, so 3.288e-6 is 0.01644% of 0.02. So the assumption that x is negligible is valid. So why does the quadratic approach give a different result?

Wait, no, wait. 3.288e-6 is 0.0003288% of 0.02? No, 3.288e-6 is 3.288e-6 / 2e-2 = 1.644e-4, which is 0.01644% of 2e-2. So 0.01644% is very small, so the assumption holds. Hence, the initial approximation was correct.

But wait, wait. If x is 3.288e-6, then [OH-] is 3.288e-6. pOH is about 5.484 → pH is 8.516.

Wait, that's about 8.52, which is option A's second value.

But wait, earlier when I assumed x is negligible, I got [OH-]=1.04e-5, which is higher. So why did I get a different result when using the quadratic?

Ah, I see. Oh wait, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, earlier when assuming x is small, I had x² = Kb *
