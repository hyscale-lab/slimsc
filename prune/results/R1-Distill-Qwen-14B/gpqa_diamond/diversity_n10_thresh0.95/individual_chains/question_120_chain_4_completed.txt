Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 over parallax (in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx.

Now the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. Wait, so it's asking for the change in the number of stars when you look at a certain range of parallax values. Like, if I consider a thin shell at a certain distance, how does the number of stars in that shell depend on the parallax.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, that means the same number density of stars in all directions. So the number of stars should depend on the volume of space at that distance.

Parallax plx = 1/d. So if I have a small change in parallax, d plx, that corresponds to a certain distance shell. Let's think about how the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be. The volume is 4πd² dr. But since dr is small, that's the volume element.

But since we're dealing with parallax, let's express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dr is the derivative of d with respect to plx. Let me compute that. dr = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. So dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dr = -dplx/(plx²). Wait, but since plx is decreasing as distance increases, for a small increase in plx, d plx is positive, and dr would be negative, meaning the shell is moving inward. Hmm, but when considering the volume, I should take the absolute value of dr because it's the thickness.

So, the volume of the shell dV is 4π d² dr. Let me substitute d = 1/plx and dr = dplx / plx² (since we take absolute value). So dV = 4π (1/plx)² * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π * (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute. d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/(plx^2). dr is dplx / plx²? Wait, no. Let me do it step by step.

d = 1/plx. So, dr = derivative of d with respect to plx times d plx. dr = (-1/plx²) * dplx.

So the thickness dr is proportional to dplx divided by plx squared. So dr = -dplx/(plx²). But for volume, the thickness is positive, so dr = dplx/(plx²) multiplied by the negative (since plx decreases as d increases), but that's just the direction. The actual thickness is |dr|, so it's dplx/(plx²).

So the volume of the shell, dV, is 4π d² |dr| = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π dplx / (plx^4). Wait, that can't be right. Because 1/plx^2 times 1/plx^2 is 1/plx^4, so 4π dplx / plx^4.

But wait, that would imply that the volume is proportional to dplx / plx^4. So, if the number density of stars is n (number per unit volume), then the number of stars in that shell would be n * dV = n * 4π dplx/(plx^4).

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, per unit plx, like, per dplx. So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. Because 4π dplx/(plx^4) is dV, and the number is n * dV, which is n * (4π dplx/(plx^4)) ). But the question is asking how the number per unit plx changes with plx. So for a given dplx, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait no, the question says "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So, per unit plx, meaning that for a small change dplx in plx, the number of stars is n * dV. So number per dplx is (n * 4π dV )/(dplx) )? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars in a shell with parallax plx and thickness dplx is N = n * dV. The dV is 4π d^2 dr, which is 4 π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2 ). So dV = 4 π dplx / plx^4. So N = n * (4 π dplx / plx^4). Therefore, the number per unit plx (so, per dplx) is N/(dplx) = n * 4 π / plx^4. So this would imply that the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are 1/plx^4, 1/plx^2, 1/plx, etc.

Wait, but the options are for how the number changes with plx. So, if you have a unit range of plx (like a fixed dplx), then N is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4. So when plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases as 1 over plx^4. So the function would be N ~ 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. But wait, I thought the volume element would lead to something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the volume calculation. Let's go again. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr. So, substituting d = 1/plx and dr = |dd|.

But dd is derivative of d with respect to plx. d = 1/plx → dd = -1/plx² dplx. So dr = |dd| = dplx / plx².

So dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) )= 4π dplx / plx^4.

So number of stars in that shell is N = n * dV = n * (4π dplx / plx^4). So the number per unit plx (dplx=1, say) is N = n * (4π / plx^4). So the number per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4. So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by analyzing the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is defined as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star in parsecs. For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \), the volume of the shell is \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dr \). 

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( dr \) in terms of \( d\text{plx} \). Taking the derivative of \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) with respect to \( \text{plx} \), we find \( dr = -\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \). The thickness \( dr \) is positive for the volume calculation, so \( dr = \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \).

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \) into the expression for \( dV \), we get:
\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume \( dV \), assuming a uniform number density \( n \) of stars. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per unit \( d\text{plx} \)) is:
\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
