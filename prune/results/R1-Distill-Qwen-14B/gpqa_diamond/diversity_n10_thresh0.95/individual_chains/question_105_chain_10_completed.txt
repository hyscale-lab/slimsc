Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, the problem is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor for these spots is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature, Teff, is 6000K. The spots are cooler, right? Because they're dark, so their temperature is lower. The temperature difference between the spots and the surrounding photosphere is 1000K. So, if the star's Teff is 6000K, the spots are at 5000K, I suppose.

The main point is that when you observe this star photometrically (which is measuring brightness over time), the brightness variations caused by the spots rotating into and out of view will look similar to the dimming caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is asking what radius a hypothetical exoplanet would need to have to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do, if the star wasn't spotted.

Wait, so when the spots are present, the star's brightness decreases as the spots rotate into view because the spots are darker (cooler). Similarly, when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The problem is saying that the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is the same as what a planet would cause. So we need to find the planet's radius relative to the star's radius to match this amplitude.

Let me think about the formula for the brightness change. When a spot is visible, the total brightness is a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas. If the star wasn't spotted, with the planet transiting, the dip is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star.

But wait, the star's brightness isn't just about area. The spots are cooler, so each spot emits less flux. So the total brightness variation due to spots would be a function of the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

First, let me think about the case of spots. The star's brightness when spots are visible will be lower than when they're not. The observed flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

The flux from a given area on the star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The total flux from the star without spots would be the entire surface emitting at 6000K. But with spots, part of the surface (20% of one hemisphere) is at 5000K.

Wait, but what's the exact setup here? The star has one hemisphere with spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 20% of (4πR² / 2), since one hemisphere is (4πR²/2) area. Wait, no, because the total surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.4πR².

But wait, the star is rotating, so when we observe it, only the spots on the hemisphere facing us are visible. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing the brightness to dip periodically.

Now, the flux when the spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the unspotted parts and the spotted parts.

The unspotted area is the entire hemisphere (2πR²) minus the spotted area (0.4πR²). So unspotted area is 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR².

Wait, no. Wait, the star has one hemisphere with 20% coverage of spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the unspotted area on that hemisphere is 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR². But when the star is viewed from Earth, we see only one hemisphere at a time. So when the spots are facing us, the total flux is (unspotted area * F_unspot) + (spotted area * F_spot). When the spots are not facing us, the flux is F_unspot for the entire hemisphere.

Wait, no. The star's rotation causes the spots to come into view. So at any given time, the hemisphere facing us may have some spots. The filling factor is 0.2, so 20% of the visible hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, but the question says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface that is spots. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 20% of that hemisphere is spots.

So the area of spots visible is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but when the star is viewed, the hemisphere facing us can be either the spotted one or the unspotted one. Wait, no, the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star is observed, we see either the spotty hemisphere or the other hemisphere. Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view.

Hmm, but the problem says that the photometric variations resemble an exoplanet. So perhaps the amplitude of the brightness change is similar to what a planet would cause.

So, the problem is about comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet.

I think I need to compute the relative brightness change in both cases and set them equal, then solve for the planet's radius.

First, let's compute the brightness variation due to the spots.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is (unspotted area + spotted area) = (0.8 * 2πR²) * F_unspot + (0.2 * 2πR²) * F_spot.

Wait, the filling factor is 0.2, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². The unspotted area on the visible hemisphere is 2π R² - 0.4π R² = 1.6 π R².

But wait, the star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = σ * (6000)^4 * 4π R². Because the entire surface is emitting at 6000K.

But when the spots are present, the flux is F = [ (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 ) + (0.4 π R² ) * σ (5000)^4 ) ].

Wait, no, because the spots are cooler. So each spot has T_spot = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.

So the flux from the unspotted area is 1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

The flux from the spots is 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

The total flux when the spots are visible is F_visible = [1.6 (6000)^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4] * σ π R².

But when the star isn't spotted (i.e., when the other hemisphere is facing us, which is unspotted), the flux is F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4. Wait no, because when the other hemisphere is facing us, which is unspotted, so the flux is the same as when the star is entirely unspotted? No, because the star's total flux is always based on the hemisphere facing us. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me think again. The star has a radius R, same as the Sun. Let's denote R_star = R.

The star's total surface area is 4π R².

One hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

When the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is the sum of the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the spotted part.

The unspotted part of that hemisphere is 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So the flux when the spots are visible is F1 = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

When the star is viewed such that the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F2 = 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but shouldn't the total flux without any spots be F0 = (4 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 / 2? Because each hemisphere is 2 π R². Wait, no. The total flux is the sum of both hemispheres. But each hemisphere emits. So the total flux is 4 π R² * σ T^4, regardless of whether you're viewing one hemisphere or the other. Wait, wait, no. When you look at a star, you see only one hemisphere. So the observed flux is based on the hemisphere that's facing you. 

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. The star emits from both hemispheres, but from Earth, we can only see one hemisphere at a time. So the total flux we observe depends on which hemisphere is facing us.

So, for a star with no spots, the flux when either hemisphere is facing us is (2 π R²) * σ T^4. Because each hemisphere is 2 π R², and the temperature is uniform.

But for the star with spots on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F1 = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

When the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, the flux is F2 = (2 π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

So the brightness variation (ΔF) is the difference between F2 and F1.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F2 - F1) / F2.

Wait, but I need to compute the change when the spot hemisphere is not visible and when it is.

Wait, suppose the star is such that the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so flux is F2. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the spotty hemisphere faces us, and flux is F1. The change in flux is F2 - F1.

So the relative change in brightness is (F2 - F1)/F2.

So let's compute F2 and F1.

F2 = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

F1 = [1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4 ].

Let me compute F1:

F1 = π R² σ [1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)].

So F1 = π R² σ [ (1.6 * 6^4) + (0.4 *5^4) ] × 10^16 (since 6000=6e3, 5000=5e3). Wait, but maybe I can factor out the 1e16.

Let me compute the terms:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

Wait, no, wait, 6000 is 6e3, so 6e3^4 = (6)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So let's plug in the numbers.

Compute 1.6 * 1.296e15:

1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.

Compute 0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

So F1 = π R² σ [2.0736e15 + 2.5e14 ].

2.5e14 is 0.25e15, so sum is 2.3236e15.

So F1 = π R² σ * 2.3236e15.

F2 = 2 π R² σ (6e3)^4 = 2 π R² σ (1.296e15) = 2.592e15 π R² σ.

Now, compute F2 - F1:

2.592e15 π R² σ - 2.3236e15 π R² σ = (2.592 - 2.3236) e15 π R² σ = 0.2684e15 π R² σ.

So the brightness change is (F2 - F1) = 0.2684e15 π R² σ.

The relative change is (F2 - F1)/F2 = (0.2684e15)/(2.592e15) ) = 0.2684 / 2.592 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% decrease when the spots are visible.

Wait, but that's a significant dip. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 10% of the star's flux.

Now, the problem is to find the radius of an exoplanet R_planet such that when it transits the star, the dip in brightness (caused by the planet blocking part of the star's light) is the same amplitude.

So for the planet transit, the dip in brightness is (Area of planet / Area of star) = (R_planet / R_star )^2.

Because the planet blocks a part of the star's disk. The dip in flux is (R_p / R_*)^2, assuming the star's brightness is uniform, which is a simplification but acceptable for this problem.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the dip in brightness is (Area of planet)/(Area of star). Because the planet blocks that part of the star's light. So the relative change is (R_p^2) / (R_*^2) = (R_p / R_*)^2.

So, the amplitude (dip) is (R_p / R_*)^2 = (ΔF_planet) / F0, where F0 is the star's flux during non-transit.

But in our case, the amplitude from the spots is about 10.35% (0.1035). So we need the planet's transit to cause the same dip. So set (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.1035.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The dip caused by the planet is a decrease of (R_p^2)/(R_*^2) of the star's light. So, you have (R_p / R_*)^2 = dip_fraction.

In the spot case, the dip when the spots are visible is (F2 - F1)/F2 = 0.1035, which is about 10.35% dip. So that's the dip amplitude.

So, for the planet, the dip is (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.1035.

Wait, but wait: the dip is (blocked area)/(total area), which is (π (R_p)^2) / (π (R_*)^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(R_*^2) = (R_p / R_*)^2.

So yes, setting that equal to 0.1035.

So, R_p = R_* * sqrt(0.1035).

Compute sqrt(0.1035): sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316. 0.1035 is a bit higher, so sqrt(0.1035) is about 0.322.

So R_p ≈ 0.322 R_*, so approximately 0.32 R_*, which would correspond to option D (~0.32).

Wait, but looking at the options: option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the dip from the spots is (F2 - F1)/F2 ≈ 10.35% ≈ 0.1035. The planet's dip is (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.1035, so R_p = R_* * sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322 R_*, which is about 0.32.

But wait, let me re-examine the calculation of F1 and F2.

F2 is 2 π R² σ (6e3)^4. F1 is [1.6 π R² σ (6e3)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5e3)^4 ].

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial computation of F1.

Wait, 1.6 * 6e3^4 = 1.6 * (6^4e12) = 1.6 * 1296e12 = 2073.6e12 = 2.0736e15.

0.4 *5e3^4 = 0.4 * (5^4e12) =0.4 * 625e12=250e12=2.5e14.

So adding 2.0736e15 + 0.25e15 (since 2.5e14 is 0.25e15) gives 2.3236e15.

Wait, no: 0.4*(5e3)^4 = 0.4 * 625e12 = 250e12 = 2.5e13? Wait, no, wait. Wait 5e3 is 5000, so (5000)^4 = (5^4)*(1e3)^4) = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14. So 0.4 *6.25e14=2.5e14.

So F1's term is 1.6*(6e3)^4 = 1.6 * 6^4 * 1e12 = 1.6 * 1296 * 1e12 = 2073.6e12 = 2.0736e15.

Adding 2.0736e15 (from 1.6 *6e3^4) and 0.4 *5e3^4 = 2.5e14 = 0.25e15. So 2.0736e15 + 0.25e15 = 2.3236e15.

F2 is 2 * (6e3)^4 * π R² σ = 2 * 1.296e15 * π R² σ = 2.592e15 * π R² σ.

So F1 = (2.3236e15) * π R² σ.

So F2 - F1 = (2.592e15 - 2.3236e15) * π R² σ = 0.2684e15 * π R² σ.

So (F2 - F1)/F2 = 0.2684e15 / 2.592e15 = 0.2684 / 2.592 ≈ 0.1035.

That's correct. So the dip is about 10.35%.

So the planet's dip is (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.1035 → R_p = R_* * sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322 R_*.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, so that's the answer.

But wait, let me check: the problem says "the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So if the star wasn't spotted, the same amplitude would be caused by the planet. So the dip due to the planet is (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.1035, so R_p ≈ 0.32 R_*, which is option D.

Wait, but another thought: when the star has spots, the dip is 10.35%, but when there's no spots, the dip is due to the planet, which must be the same 10.35%. So yes, the planet's radius is ~32% of the star's radius.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered by dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Temperature difference between spots and surrounding photosphere: \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \) (\( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the total flux is a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas:
     \[
     F_{\text{visible}} = (1.6 \pi R^2) \cdot \sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 \pi R^2) \cdot \sigma (5000)^4
     \]
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2 \pi R^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4
     \]
   - The relative brightness variation is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{visible}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     F_{\text{visible}} = \pi R^2 \sigma [1.6 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.4 \cdot (5000)^4]
     \]
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{visible}} = \pi R^2 \sigma [2 \cdot (6000)^4 - (1.6 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.4 \cdot (5000)^4)]
     \]
     \[
     \Delta F = \pi R^2 \sigma [0.4 \cdot (6000)^4 - 0.4 \cdot (5000)^4]
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot (6000)^4 - 0.4 \cdot (5000)^4}{2 \cdot (6000)^4}
     \]
     - Compute \( (6000)^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \) and \( (5000)^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \):
       \[
       \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot (1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14})}{2 \cdot 1.296 \times 10^{15}}
       \]
       \[
       \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 6.71 \times 10^{14}}{2.592 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
       \]

3. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, set:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
   - Solve for \( R_{\text{planet}} \):
     \[
     R_{\text{planet}} = R_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{0.1035} \approx R_{\text{star}} \cdot 0.322
     \]
   - Thus, \( R_{\text{planet}} \approx 0.32 \, R_{\text{star}} \).

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**. This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
