Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Right, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. 

So the dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 would be (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Got that.

Next, the titration with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react with acetic acid, which is a weak acid. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

Now, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's handle each part separately.

Starting with the 25% titration point. 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. So I need to find the volume of NaOH added when 25% of the equivalence point is reached.

But wait, how do I find the equivalence point volume? The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: concentration is 0.025 M, volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid = 0.001. So volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the initial solution is 40 cm³, and adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH makes the total solution 42.5 cm³. But when we're calculating concentrations, we have to consider the total volume.

Hmm, but wait, for the 25% titration, the calculation would involve the amount of NaOH added. Let's think about how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 * moles of acetic acid.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration would mean that 25% of the required NaOH has been added, which neutralizes 25% of the acetic acid.

Wait, but in terms of moles: the total moles of acetic acid is 0.001 moles. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So the NaOH added is 0.00025 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. Yep, same as before.

So, after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, some of the acetic acid has been converted into acetate ions. So we can model this using the buffer solution equation because we have both the acid and its conjugate base.

The moles of acetic acid reacted would be equal to the moles of NaOH added, which is
