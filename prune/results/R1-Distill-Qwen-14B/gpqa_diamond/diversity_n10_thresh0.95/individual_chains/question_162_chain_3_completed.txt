Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric because it only has dx and dy. Oh right, because the pseudosphere is a 2D surface embedded in 3D, but maybe here we're considering the induced metric.

Wait, the metric is written in terms of x and y. So I guess we're working in 2D here. The question is about a pseudosphere, which I remember is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric might be representing some kind of hyperbolic space.

I think the area of a pseudosphere with radius r is similar to the area of a regular sphere, but since it's hyperbolic, the area might be different. For a regular sphere, the area is 4πr², but for a pseudosphere, it's different because the curvature is negative.

Wait, but wait. The metric here isn't in the standard form I'm familiar with for hyperbolic space. The standard metric for hyperbolic space in 2D is usually something like ds² = dr² + (a²/(1 - (r²/a²)))² dθ², where a is the radius of curvature. Or alternatively, in terms of other coordinates, like Poincaré coordinates.

Alternatively, looking at this metric, it's conformally flat because it's just a scaling factor times dx² + dy². So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). That denominator looks like 4 minus (x² + y²), which suggests that the domain of x and y is such that x² + y² <4. So the radius is 2, which aligns with the given r=2.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), so as (x² + y²) approaches 4, the metric blows up. That suggests that the coordinate system is valid only within the circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So maybe this is a model of hyperbolic space, but I'm not exactly sure which model this is.

Wait, Poincaré disk model! Oh right, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is something like ds² = 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2 (dx² + dy²). But in this problem, the metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let's see: let me factor out the 4 from the denominator. So 4 - (x² + y²) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/(2²)). So the denominator can be written as 4(1 - r²/4), where r is the radial coordinate in 2D, sqrt(x² + y²).

So the metric becomes (32)/(4(1 - r²/4)) (dx² + dy²) = (8)/(1 - r²/4) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, but the standard Poincaré disk model is ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dx² + dy²). So this isn't matching directly. Maybe it's scaled differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's another conformal model. But maybe the important thing is that this is a hyperbolic metric, and in the context of the pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature), the area can be calculated.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, wait, the pseudosphere is a surface embedded in 3D, but in this case, perhaps the metric is representing the induced metric on the pseudosphere.

Alternatively, maybe the given metric is in the plane, and the pseudosphere is a surface in this space.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think differently. The area of a surface in 2D is calculated using the metric. The area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

The given metric is diagonal, so the determinant g is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, because ds² = g_{xx} (dx)^2 + g_{yy} (dy)^2, and since g_{xy}=0 and g_{yx}=0, the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, no: the metric tensor is diagonal, so the determinant is the product of the diagonal terms. So the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] * [32/(4 - x² - y²)] = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy, which would be (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

So the total area would be the integral over all x and y where the metric is defined. The domain is where 4 -x² - y² >0, i.e., x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2.

Thus, the area A is the integral over the disk of radius 2 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that integral. Let's switch to polar coordinates for easier integration.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so x² + y² = r². The Jacobian determinant is r, so dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

We can separate the integrals:

A = 32 ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Calculating the θ integral first: ∫0^2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π * ∫0^2 [r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, the integral ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr. Let me compute that.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 - 4=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (1/u) * (-1/2) du ].

Which is (-1/2) ∫4^0 (1/u) du = (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0. So the integral becomes:

(-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ). But ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, this suggests the integral diverges. Because as u approaches zero, 1/u approaches infinity.

Wait a minute, but that can't be right. Because the area of a pseudosphere shouldn't be infinite. Hmm. Or wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in setting up the integral.

Wait, no, the integrand [r/(4 - r²)] as r approaches 2 becomes [2/(4-4)] which is 2/0, so it blows up. So the integral from 0 to 2 will have a divergence, meaning the integral is infinite. So the area would be infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but that can't be right because the pseudosphere is a finite area surface. Or is it? Wait, maybe I'm confusing the hyperbolic plane with the pseudosphere.

Wait, the pseudosphere is a finite area surface because it's a surface of revolution of a tractrix, and it has finite area. But wait, here the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with r=2. Wait, but in the metric given, perhaps this is representing the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Because the metric is defined over a disk of radius 2, but the hyperbolic plane is usually considered as having a metric that's conformally flat but with a different scaling.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So this is a metric on a disk of radius 2, which is a finite region. So integrating the area over that region would give a finite value. But earlier, when I computed the integral, it seemed to lead to a divergence. So maybe I made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, let me compute the integral ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me re-express the integral:

∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r²) = (-1/2) ∫ [ du ] / u, where u=4 - r².

So the integral becomes (-1/2) [ ln |u| ] + C. Evaluated from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0).

So when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0, so ln(u) approaches negative infinity.

So the integral is (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ] = (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln(4) ) ] → (infty) as ln(4) is a finite number. So the integral diverges to infinity.

But that can't be correct because the area of the pseudosphere shouldn't be infinite. Wait, but the pseudosphere is a different object. The metric given here is in 2D, but perhaps it's modeling the hyperbolic plane, which indeed has infinite area. Because the hyperbolic plane is a non-compact space, so its area is infinite.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is a compact surface, right? It's a finite area surface with finite total curvature. So perhaps the metric given here isn't representing a pseudosphere but rather a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

Wait, the question says 'the pseudosphere of radius r=2'. So perhaps I'm confusing the terms here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the pseudosphere (or tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature, and it's a finite area surface. But the metric given might not correspond to the pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is of the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

Wait, but the metric here is defined on a disk of radius 2, but in reality, the hyperbolic plane is also non-compact, so integrating over all x and y (with x² + y² <4) would give a finite area? But according to the integral, it gives an infinite area. So perhaps this is a model of the hyperbolic plane, but in a compactified coordinate system, but it's not the entire hyperbolic plane.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, but the metric provided might not be the one on the pseudosphere. Because the pseudosphere is a 2D surface, but perhaps the metric is given in its embedding space, which is 3D, but the question's metric is 2D, which would be the induced metric on the pseudosphere.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think about the area calculation again.

In the metric ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), the area element is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. The domain is x² + y² <4.

So the area would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

In polar coordinates, this becomes 32 ∫ (0 to 2π) ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral: ∫ (0 to 2) r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me do substitution u=4 - r², du= -2 r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [ (1/u) * (-du/2) ) ].

Which is (-1/2) ∫4^0 (1/u) du = (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

That equals (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral becomes (-1/2)(-infty - ln4) ) → (1/2)(infty + ln4) ) → infty.

So the integral diverges. So the area is infinite. Therefore, the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the pseudosphere is a finite area object. So why is the area infinite here?

Ah, perhaps because the given metric isn't representing the pseudosphere, but rather a model of hyperbolic space, which is unbounded. The pseudosphere is a compact surface, whereas hyperbolic space is non-compact.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the area within the given coordinate system's domain, which is a finite disk, but the metric's denominator approaches zero as you approach the boundary, making the area integral diverge.

So according to the calculation, the area is infinite. Looking at the options, D is +infty. So the answer must be D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2. This metric is conformally flat, and the area element is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the domain \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral \(\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr\), use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which gives:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln|u|\right]_4^0.
\]

As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln|u| \to -\infty\), so the integral diverges:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \to \infty.
\]

This implies that the total area diverges to infinity. The metric represents a hyperbolic-like space, and the divergence of the integral reflects the infinite area of the hyperbolic plane. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
