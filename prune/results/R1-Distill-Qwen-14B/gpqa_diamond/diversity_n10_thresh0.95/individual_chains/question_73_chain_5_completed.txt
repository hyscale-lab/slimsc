Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with relativity concepts. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. You can't just subtract 0.6c and 0.5c to get the relative speed. Oh right, you need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, wait, the formula is for when you're moving at a certain speed relative to another frame. So when both are moving in the same direction, how do we find the relative speed?

Oh wait, I think the relative speed u' between the two astronauts would be calculated using the formula for velocity addition. The formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of the second astronaut in the first's frame, or something like that. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the first astronaut (let's say the one moving at 0.6c) is at rest, and the other is moving at 0.5c. So from the first's perspective, the second is moving at a speed u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Wait, that would give a negative speed, but speed is a magnitude, right? So the relative speed would be the absolute value, which would be (0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) → 0.1c/(1-0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 → approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now, the total energy of the system. I think we have to calculate the relativistic energy for each astronaut and add them together. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, moving at 0.6c), gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, moving at 0.5c), gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and its relative speed is 0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct option should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. For the relative speed calculation, I considered the first astronaut's frame. Alternatively, I could have considered the second astronaut's frame, but since they are moving in the same direction, it's the same result. So the relative speed between them is 0.14c.

So the correct option is C: v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut) and \( v = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

Taking the absolute value, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), velocity \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), velocity \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

Adding the two energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
