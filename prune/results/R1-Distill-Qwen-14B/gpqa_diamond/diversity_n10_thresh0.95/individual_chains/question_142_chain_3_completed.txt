Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of states rather than a pure state). But wait, what's the geometrical position? Oh right, I think it's about how this matrix sits in the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state, the vector points from the origin to the surface of the sphere. But for mixed states, like this density matrix, the representation is a bit different. I think the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. 

Let me recall the general form of a single-qubit density matrix. It's something like ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) that tells us where on the sphere the state is. So for a pure state |ψ><ψ|, r would have a length of 1, pointing to the state's position on the Bloch sphere. For a mixed state, r has a length less than 1, indicating it's inside the sphere.

So looking at the given ρ, I can expand it. Let me write it out:

ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). 

Wait, |0> is [1, 0]^T and |1> is [0, 1]^T. So |0><0| is the outer product, which is a diagonal matrix [[1,0], [0,0]], and similarly |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

But wait, the identity matrix is 2x2. So ρ = (I)/2. Now, comparing this to the standard form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, I can see what r must be.

Let me expand (I + r·σ)/2. The Pauli matrices σ are [[0,1],[1,0]] (σx), [[0,-i],[i,0]] (σy), and [[1,0],[0,-1]] (σz). So r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. 

So if I have (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2, and our ρ is (I)/2, that means the r_x, r_y, r_z terms must be zero. Because adding any of the Pauli terms would change the off-diagonal elements or the diagonal elements beyond just the identity.

Wait, let me check. So the given ρ is (I)/2. So all the terms of (r·σ) must be zero. Which implies that the vector r is (0,0,0). 

That means the density matrix is at the completely mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. So the geometrical position is the origin, r=(0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), it is evident that the terms involving \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) must vanish, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). 

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented geometrically as the origin of the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is 

\[
r = (0, 0, 0).
\]

Answer: C
