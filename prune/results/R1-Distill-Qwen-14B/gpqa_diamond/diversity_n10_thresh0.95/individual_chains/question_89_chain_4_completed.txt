Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum, excluding any exchangeable protons.

Alright, let's break this down. I'll start by figuring out each step's product.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, an elimination reaction usually occurs, forming an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two equivalents of HBr to form an alkene. Wait, but wait: 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of an adamantane structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, highly branched, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, the structure is something like a cage where each carbon is bonded to three others.

Heating with KOH (probably via an E2 mechanism) would lead to the loss of two HBr molecules to form a double bond. So the product would be an adamatene, specifically 1,3-diamantadiene? Or perhaps 1,2-diamantadiene? Wait, no. The positions matter. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3? Hmm, maybe I should draw the structure.

Wait, in the structure of adamantane, each bridgehead carbon (like C1 and C3) is connected to three other carbons. So when you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, those two are on opposite ends of the molecule. Elimination would require that the H's removed are adjacent to each Br, so for each Br, we have an H on the same carbon or adjacent. Wait, but in E2, the H and Br are on adjacent carbons, so for two eliminations, I think each Br would lose an H from the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Or perhaps elimination leads to a conjugated diene? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, since it's a dihalide, maybe it's an anti elimination forming a single double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. When you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a vicinal dihalide? No, vicinal is adjacent carbons, but 1 and 3 are two apart. So perhaps it's a 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a diegeminal dihalide? No, diegeminal would have two on the same carbon. Alternatively, it's a dihalide with two bromines on different bridgehead carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Because if 1 and 3 are adjacent bridgeheads, that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single double bond because KOH would cause an elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a diene. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the first product is a diepoxy or something else. No, KOH in such a reaction usually leads to elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it forms an epoxide? No, wait, that's with peracids. Wait, KOH with dihalides typically leads to elimination, forming alkenes. So, for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the adjacent Hs are abstracted, leading to a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromo isn't vicinal. Oh wait, in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are actually adjacent in a certain arrangement. Let me think: the adamantane structure has four cyclohexane rings. The bridgehead carbons are 1, 2, 3, 4 perhaps. So 1 and 3 would be across from each other, maybe not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and when KOH is added, elimination occurs to form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a mono-ene. So, each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination forms a double bond between the two bridgeheads. But that's unlikely because bridgeheads are usually not double-bonded due to Bredt's rule. Ah, right, Bredt's rule states that bridgehead double bonds are generally not stable, especially in bridged bicyclic systems. So, perhaps the elimination forms a single double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a non-bridgehead carbon. But that depends on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a single double bond in a position where Bredt's rule doesn't apply.

Wait, the NMR data is given for product 1. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably an -OCH2- group, as that region is typical for such protons. Then, 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), which could be from a cyclohexane ring or perhaps from methylene groups adjacent to an oxygen. Then, 1.94 ppm (2H), which might be another CH2 group.

Wait, the IR spectrum has a characteristic peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So product 1 has a carbonyl group, which suggests that the reaction isn't just a simple elimination to form an alkene. So, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to an epoxide, but that's not right because epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, could it be a ketone or an ester?

Wait, another possibility: the KOH could be acting as a base to perform a nucleophilic substitution. But in the case of vicinal dihalides, when treated with a base, elimination is more likely. However, if it's a geminal dihalide (both Brs on the same carbon), substitution could form a carbonyl. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is not a geminal dihalide. Hmm.

Wait, if the product has a carbonyl, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a diketone? Or maybe it's a formation of a ketone via elimination. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a quaternary carbon, and elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about this. Suppose each Br is on a carbon next to a quaternary center. When KOH is used, perhaps each Br is eliminated with the abstraction of a proton from the adjacent carbon. So, each Br- leaves, and the adjacent H is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. But then, how does that form a carbonyl?

Oh wait, maybe it's a di-elimination, but each elimination forms a carbonyl. So for each Br, elimination forms a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require each Br to be on a secondary carbon, perhaps. Wait, maybe each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a tertiary carbon, so that elimination leads to a carbonyl. For example, in vicinal dihalides, if each X is on a carbon adjacent to a CH2 that can form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon that is adjacent to a CH2 group. When KOH abstracts a beta-proton, each Br leaves, and the adjacent CH2 becomes a carbonyl group.

Wait, that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent to a CH2 group, allowing for two eliminations to form two carbonyl groups. So, for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH2, elimination would form two ketones. So, product 1 would be 1,3-diketone adamantane.

But wait, wait. Let me think. If each Br is on a CH2 group adjacent to a CH2, but that's not possible in adamantane. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a dihalide where each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, which is adjacent to a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. For example, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, each Br is eliminated, each with an adjacent H, leading to the formation of two ketone groups. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) as a doublet. If it's a ketone, the 2H at 4.79 might be something else, perhaps an -OCH2- group. Wait, but product 1's IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So that suggests the presence of a ketone. But if the product is a diketone, perhaps the NMR would have two carbonyl groups. Where would the 4.79 ppm signal come from?

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't form a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, but epoxides don't have carbonyls. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the KOH is acting as a base to cause a ring-opening of an epoxide. But I don't think that's the case here because the starting material is a dihalide, not an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a glycol, like an epoxide ring-opening. But that doesn't fit with the NMR data either.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol. But diols typically don't have a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing an elimination to form an alkene, but then some other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol that is further oxidized, but that seems unlikely under basic conditions.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, and the other Br is in another position. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the first step. Maybe I should look at the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm peak is two protons, probably as a doublet. That could be an -OCH2- group, as in an ether or ester. The 1.94 ppm is two protons, perhaps another CH2 group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests perhaps some methyl groups in a ring, like in a cyclohexane.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first reaction is a hydrolysis of the dibromide to a vicinal diol. But that would require a SN2 mechanism on each Br, but with such a bulky structure, SN2 is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a diene.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe the first reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Wait, but how?

Alternative approach: Let's think about product 1. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, so a carbonyl. So, it's either an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an acid (but aliphatic acids have lower wavenumbers around 1700-1725, but more like 1700-1750. Wait, 1720 is typical for an ester or ketone. So, perhaps product 1 is a diketone.

If product 1 is a diketone, then its structure would have two ketone groups. Let's imagine that structure. Then, in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) must be something else. Maybe an adjacent CH2 group. Wait, but in a diketone, the adjacent CH2 would be deshielded, perhaps around 2.2-2.4 ppm. Hmm, but the 4.79 ppm is higher, maybe an -OCH2- group.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which upon treatment with KOH eliminates two equivalents of HBr to form a conjugated diene. But then, that wouldn't explain the IR peak for a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms an enol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. But how? Let me think. If KOH is involved, perhaps it's a saponification, but that would require esters as starting materials.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, each elimination forming a carbonyl. So, each Br is on a secondary carbon, and elimination leads to a ketone. So, the product is 1,3-adamantanedione.

In that case, the NMR would show the carbonyl protons, but wait, ketones don't have protons attached. So, the 4.79 ppm peak must be something else. Maybe it's an -OCH2- group adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, but in a diketone, the adjacent CH2 groups would be more downfield. Let me think about the structure. If the structure is something like O=C-R-C=O, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would be around 2.2-2.4 ppm, which matches the 2.41-2.23 region in the NMR. Then, the 4.79 ppm peak is a different group.

Wait, maybe it's an epoxide where the oxygen is between two CH2 groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that would require something else.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms an epoxide. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone and an epoxide. But that's getting more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the first step is not an elimination but a substitution. If KOH is in excess, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, forming a diol. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, so that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the NMR data given.

Product 1's 1H NMR:

4.79 (2H) â maybe an -OCH2- group, as that's around where such protons resonate.

2.41-2.23 (10H) â perhaps several equivalent protons in a ring or geminal positions.

1.94 (2H) â perhaps another CH2 group.

The IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So, putting it together, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide with a ketone group? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal diol that's dehydrated to form a carbonyl group. But that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, it undergoes two eliminations, each forming a double bond, but since the molecule is rigid, they form conjugated double bonds, and then possibly some oxidation occurs, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with an adjacent ether group. For example, if a CH2-O-CH2 group is present. But how?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction leads to the formation of an epoxide, but the epoxide is then opened by KOH to form a diol. But that wouldn't form a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm stuck on the first step. Perhaps I should look for the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, commonly used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But for Friedel-Crafts, you need an aromatic ring, and adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for acetylation or some alkylation.

Wait, but if product 1 has a carbonyl group, maybe it's a ketone. Then, treating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some kind of acylation. Wait, but AlCl3 is more commonly used for Friedel-Crafts. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Beckmann rearrangement, but that requires oximes.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl in product 1 is an aldehyde or ketone, and upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, a Friedel-Crafts type reaction occurs, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide is used to open it. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide helps in forming some kind of acetal or ketal. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps not.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Then, product 2 could be an enol ether or something else.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting too stuck. Let's think about the ozonolysis step.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2, followed by work-up with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, so product 2 is the result of product 1 reacting with Al isopropoxide. So, product 1 must have a functional group that can form a double bond upon reaction with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, what reactions involve Al isopropoxide and generate double bonds? Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but again, not applicable if no aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydration reaction, forming an alkene from an alcohol.

If product 1 has an alcohol group, then with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide, it could form an oxonium ion, leading to elimination (dehydration) to form an alkene. So, product 2 would have a double bond.

So, putting it together:

1,3-dibromoadamantane â product 1 (after KOH) â product 2 (after Al isopropoxide) â product 3 (after ozonolysis).

So, let's reconstruct:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH â product 1 (maybe a diol or something with a carbonyl).
2. product 1 + Al isopropoxide â product 2 (maybe elimination forms a double bond).
3. product 2 â ozonolysis â product 3 (splits into fragments with carbonyls).

But I'm still not clear on product 1.

Back to product 1: If the IR shows a carbonyl (around 1720 cm-1), perhaps it's an ester or ketone.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let's say product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, moving to product 2: heating with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a diketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of enolization or forms an enolate, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol, then heating with Al isopropoxide could cause elimination (dehydration) to form a double bond. So, product 2 would have a double bond.

Wait, but product 1's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be -OCH2- if it's an ether or ester. If product 1 is a diol, maybe the structures are such that the diol has two OH groups and a CH2O group.

Wait, perhaps after the first step, the product is a diepoxide, but I don't see the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol with an adjacent carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an ether group. So, the structure might have a CH2-O-CH2 group adjacent to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

If product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 will have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. So, product 3's NMR will show signals from the resulting carbonyls and any adjacent protons.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is what's being asked. Deshielded protons are usually those near electronegative groups or in a conjugated system.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to the carbonyl groups formed from ozonolysis.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a double bond typically forms carbonyl groups. For example, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, ozonolysis would cleave it, forming two carbonyl groups, perhaps as ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substituents.

But in adamantane, the structure is highly branched, so the double bond could be in a position where each end has substituents, leading to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of product 2 is such that ozonolysis produces a dialdehyde or a diketone, or a combination.

Wait, but product 3's NMR is what's needed. The coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton.

So, perhaps the most deshielded protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups. Let's imagine that product 3 has a structure with a CH2 group adjacent to a ketone. The protons on CH2 would be split by neighboring protons.

Wait, but the most deshielded would be those closest to the carbonyl. So, perhaps they are on a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

If the CH2 is between two carbonyls, then each proton on CH2 would have neighboring protons from the adjacent groups. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 would be next to another CH2, leading to coupling.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain with two ketones on each end. The middle CH2 groups would each have two neighboring CH2 groups. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that after ozonolysis, a single CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. Suppose product 2 is an adamantene (with a double bond), and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl-containing compounds. But since adamantane is a cage structure, the ozonolysis would create two carbonyl groups connected in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a mono-ene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups, but in adamantane, perhaps it's a bridge that is split.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the bridge, forming two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have a structure with two carbonyl groups connected by a chain.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, and ozonolysis forms two aldehyde groups. Then, product 3 would be dialdehyde, with the aldehyde protons being the most deshielded.

But aldehyde protons typically appear around 9-10 ppm. However, in the given NMR, we don't see peaks that high. Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis forms ketones instead of aldehydes, so the most deshielded protons are adjacent to ketones.

Wait, the problem states that in the 1H NMR of product3, we're to consider the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent. So, perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Let me think about the possible coupling. If the CH2 is between two carbonyls, then each CH2 proton would be adjacent to another CH2 group. But if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group has two neighboring CH2 groups. However, wait, that's a four-carbon chain with two ketones. The middle CH2 groups would each be next to two other CH2 groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is adjacent to a single CH2 group, leading to a triplet coupling.

Wait, another possibility: if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-O, but that's more like an ether, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, making a four-carbon chain with ketones at both ends. The central CH2 groups would each have two neighboring CH2 groups. So, each CH2 would have two neighboring sets of protons.

Wait, but each CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two protons. So, each proton on the central CH2 would couple with four protons (two from each adjacent CH2 group). That would lead to a quintet (pentet), but the options don't include that. Wait, no, the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Wait, let me think about the number of neighboring protons. If a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each with two protons, then each H on the central CH2 would be split by four neighboring Hs. But in reality, each H on CH2 would couple with each H on the neighboring CH2 groups. So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no. Let's think about it: Each H in the CH2 group is adjacent to two Hs on each neighboring CH2 group. So, for each H, there are 2 neighboring Hs on one side and 2 on the other. So, each H would couple with 4 Hs in total. But this would be a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets. Because each H is split by two neighboring groups, each with two Hs, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets. Wait, but that's not exactly right.

Wait, perhaps if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to another CH2. No, perhaps it's a chain of CH2-CH2-CH2. In that case, each CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2 groups. For example, the middle CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So, each H in the middle CH2 would be split by both adjacent CH2 groups. So, each H would couple with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets. Because each coupling would split the peak into a doublet, and then each of those doublets would be split again by the other coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but if each CH2 is next to another CH2, the splitting pattern would depend on how the coupling occurs. Let's think about a simple example: CH2-CH2. Each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the next CH2. So, each H would split into a triplet. Similarly, each H on the next CH2 would couple with two Hs on the first, leading to a triplet. So, in that case, each CH2 group would be a triplet.

But in the case where the CH2 is between two CH2 groups (like CH2-CH2-CH2), the middle CH2 would have two adjacent CH2 groups. Each H in the middle would couple with two Hs on each side. So, each H would have two couplings, each with J similar values, leading to a triplet of triplets. Because each coupling (from the left and right) would split the peak into a doublet, and then each of those would be further split by the other coupling, leading to two doublets each split into two, making four peaks. Wait, but that's a quartet, not a triplet of triplets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets. Let me think, the first coupling (J1) would split each H into a doublet, and then each of those would be split again by the second coupling (J2) into another doublet. So, each peak would become a doublet of doublets, which would result in four peaks. But that's not a triplet of triplets. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is adjacent to two other CH2 groups, leading to a more complex splitting.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think about the options. The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

Which of these would result from a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a bridge, where the CH2 group is adjacent to two different groups. For example, if the CH2 is connected to two different CH2 groups on either side, each with two Hs. Then, each H in the central CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on one side and two on the other. So, each H would have four neighboring Hs, but that's not possible because each H can only couple with adjacent Hs.

Wait, no, each H on the central CH2 would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. So, if each adjacent group has two Hs, then each H on the central CH2 would have two coupling partners on each side. So, each H would be split by two J values, each of which would split the peak into a doublet. So, the overall splitting would be a doublet of doublets, which is not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is next to one group with two Hs and another group with one H. Then, the splitting would be a triplet and a doublet, leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe the CH2 is next to a single group with three Hs. No, that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, if it's a CH group next to a carbonyl, then it would have coupling with adjacent Hs. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the middle CH2 groups would each have two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two Hs, leading to each H being split into a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in this structure, each CH2 is between two CH2 groups (like CH2-CH2-CH2), so the middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups. So, each H on the middle CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the left and the two on the right. That would result in each H being split into a triplet of triplets. So, the splitting pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But wait, let me think again. Each H on the middle CH2 would have two neighbors on the left and two on the right. So, the splitting from the left would be a triplet (each H on left splits into 2, so n+1=3), and then each of those would be split again by the right, leading to 3x3=9 peaks. But that's a nonet, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants are similar, leading to a triplet of triplets, which would be a total of six peaks, but that's not matching either.

Wait, no. Each H on the middle CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the left (each with J1) and the two Hs on the right (each with J2). So, the first split (from left) would be into a triplet, and each of those would be split into a triplet by the right, leading to a total of 3x3=9 peaks. But this is not one of the options. The options don't have a nonet, but perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is only with the adjacent CH2 group, so each H is split into a triplet. For example, each CH2 has two adjacent Hs, so each H is a triplet. But that would be option A. However, if each CH2 is between two others, maybe each H has two couplings, leading to a more complex pattern.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is only adjacent to one CH2 group, not two. So, for example, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but the middle CH2 is at the end, so only adjacent to one CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Another approach: perhaps the ozonolysis results in two carbonyl groups, and the protons in question are on a CH2 group next to both carbonyls. So, each H on that CH2 is adjacent to two carbonyls, but the coupling would come from neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would be split into a triplet. So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, option A.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two different groups, each with two Hs, then each H would have two coupling partners, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Product 2 is formed from product 1 treated with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a diol, then Al isopropoxide would induce elimination (dehydration), forming an alkene. So, product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The structure of product 3 would depend on where the double bond was in product 2.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, say, in the middle of a chain, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, for example, if product 2 is CH2=CH, then ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups. But in adamantane, the structure is more complex.

But let's imagine product 2 is an adamantene with a single double bond. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups, perhaps on adjacent carbons.

So, product 3 could have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, making a four-carbon chain with ketones on each end. The middle CH2 groups would each have two adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, no. If the ozonolysis breaks the double bond, each end would form a carbonyl. So, perhaps the structure is O=C-(CH2)n-C=O. For example, if the double bond was between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would produce O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O.

In that case, the two CH2 groups in the middle would each be adjacent to two other CH2 groups. Each H on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 group is only adjacent to one other CH2 group. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 is next to another CH2. So, each H on the CH2 would be split by two Hs on one adjacent group and two on the other. But that would lead to a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is only with one adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

Hmm. Given the options, and considering the splitting from two adjacent CH2 groups, the most likely coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets (option B) or a quintet (option D), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group that's between two CH2 groups, each with two Hs, then each H would be split by two Hs on each side. So, each H would experience two coupling constants, leading to a triplet of triplets. So, the correct answer would be option B.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of triplets.

Wait, another angle: The most deshielded H would be adjacent to two different sets of Hs. For example, if it's next to a CH group and a CH2 group. Then, the coupling would be a doublet of triplets. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure leads to each H being split by two Hs (a triplet) and another two Hs (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

In any case, considering the options, I think the correct answer is B) triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending with the analysis of the NMR spectrum of product 3. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - KOH likely induces an elimination reaction, forming a carbonyl-containing compound due to the IR absorption at 1720 cmâ»Â¹.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm for 2H, 2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H, and 1.94 ppm for 2H) suggests the presence of a carbonyl group and adjacent CHâ groups.

2. **Reaction 2: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates further reaction, possibly forming an alkene (double bond) through dehydration or a related mechanism.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl-containing fragments in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Analysis of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is on a CHâ group adjacent to carbonyl groups. This CHâ group is flanked by two other CHâ groups, each contributing two protons.  
   - Each hydrogen on the central CHâ group couples with two protons on one adjacent CHâ group (forming a triplet) and two protons on the other adjacent CHâ group (forming another triplet).  
   - This results in a splitting pattern of a **triplet of triplets** for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B
