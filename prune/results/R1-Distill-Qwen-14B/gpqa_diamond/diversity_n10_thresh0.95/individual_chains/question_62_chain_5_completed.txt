Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using the correct sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure. The name suggests that there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group and a methyl group. Wait, no, wait. Let me parse that better. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which means it's a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a CH2OH-Cyclohexyl group attached, and then another part is a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). Wait, no: the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexane, and at position 1, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group, and then it's also a carbaldehyde. So, maybe the structure is something like a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to both another cyclohexane ring (cyclohexyl) and an OH group. And the main ring also has a formyl group (CHO).

Wait, no. Wait, the name is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the main ring is cyclohexane with a carbonyl group attached. So, the main molecule is a cyclohexane with a CHO group, and at position 1, there's a substituent that is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So maybe it's:

The main ring is cyclohexane with a CHO group. Then, attached at position 1 is a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group (so another cyclohexane ring attached) and an OH group. So it's like:

Cyclohexane-CHO-CH2-OH and also CH2 connected to another cyclohexane? No, wait. Let me think again. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the substituent is CH2 attached to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH. So, the structure is:

Main ring: cyclohexane, position 1 has a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group (another cyclohexane ring) and an OH group. Plus, the main ring has a formyl (CHO) group.

So, the molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a CH2 group at position 1 that's attached to a cyclohexyl and an OH.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so it's cyclohexane with an acetylene group. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no. Ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH. So, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡C-H? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH, so it's like cyclohexane attached to a carbon with a triple bond and a hydrogen. So, the starting material is cyclohexylacetylene or ethynylcyclohexane. I think I got that right.

Now, I need to figure out the reagents that would transform ethynylcyclohexane into the target molecule. Let's think about possible reactions.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is part of the main cyclohexane ring (with a CHO group). So, perhaps the ethynyl group can be functionalized in steps.

First, maybe the triple bond can be converted into a diol. Wait, but how? Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated. Wait, but the target doesn't have a triple bond; maybe it's used to form a new structure.

Hmm, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent. That suggests that perhaps a cyclohexane ring is formed via some ring-opening or perhaps a coupling reaction.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be used to form a new ring via some alkyne chemistry. Let's think about possible reagents.

Looking at the options, the first reagent in all options is NaNH2 and some chloride or methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonations. For example, in the formation of Grignard reagents, but wait, wait. Or, maybe it's used in alkyne chemistry. Wait, NaNH2 is used in the alkyne alkylation—like the formation of alkenes via deprotonation and alkylation. Alternatively, NaNH2 can be used to deprotonate terminal alkynes to form an acetylide.

So, for ethynylcyclohexane, reacting with NaNH2 would deprotonate the triple bond, forming an acetylide. Then, perhaps an alkylation with methyl chloride? So, for example, the acetylide would attack methyl chloride, adding a methyl group. So, that would give cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡C-CH3 group? Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡C-H. Deprotonating with NaNH2 gives cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, adding methyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So, the structure becomes 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne? Wait, no. Let me think: the starting material is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. Deprotonating gives cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would add a methyl group to the acetylide, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So, the product would be 1-pentyne attached to cyclohexane? Or wait, perhaps it's 1-cyclohexylpropyne? Hmm, perhaps it's more about adding a methyl group to the acetylide, making a longer alkyne.

But wait, the target molecule doesn't have an alkyne. So perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated. Looking at the options, some of them have H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation. So, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, but perhaps more importantly, hydrogenated all the way to an alkane? No, wait, H2 with Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, but depending on conditions, it might go to cis or trans double bond (if partial hydrogenation) or fully saturate to a single bond (full hydrogenation).

Wait, but in the target molecule, there’s a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2, which is connected to an OH and the main ring. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which can then be used to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a new ring via cycloaddition, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane or something else.

Wait, another approach. The target molecule has a formyl group (CHO). How can we introduce that? Perhaps oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde. Or maybe via a Grignard reaction or another addition.

Let me think about the steps needed:

1. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the triple bond to form an acetylide, then alkylate it to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne. Then, perhaps hydrogenate that alkyne to a diol, which can be oxidized to a carbonyl?

Wait, but let's look at the options. Option C's first step is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That would form the methylated acetylide. Then step 2 is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a hydrogenation catalyst. So, the alkyne would be hydrogenated to an alkane via hydrogenation? Wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of alkynes can go to alkenes or alkanes, depending on the conditions. Lindlar's catalyst (H2 with poisoned catalyst like Pb or Quinoline) would hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene. Using H2 with Pd would probably hydrogenate the alkyne all the way to an alkane.

Wait, but then after hydrogenation, we have a cyclohexane ring with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane via some [2+2] addition, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. Wait, that would require a ketone or aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: let's think about the target molecule. It's a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent at position 1. The substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps that substituent comes from an epoxide ring-opening or something like that.

Wait, let me think about the reagents in the options.

Option D has NaNH2 and methanol as the first step. That might be for eliminating a proton and forming an acetylide, then quenching with methanol.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps the correct sequence involves forming a diol from the alkyne, then forming a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the target has a formyl group, so perhaps that comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to acetylide → alkylate to add a group → hydrogenate to alkene or alkane → dihydroxylation to diol → then ring-opening or something to form a carbonyl group.

Or perhaps, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then some dihydroxylation (like with O3) to form a diol, which can then undergo oxidation.

Wait, but let's look at the options again.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms an acetylide and adds methyl group, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the alkyne. If it's hydrogenated all the way, becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would be adding two carbons. So, the main ring would have a propyl group attached? Not sure.

Alternatively, if it's hydrogenated to a double bond, then perhaps we can do something else.

Wait, but the second step in option C is H2 and Pd-calcium carbonate. That's a catalyst for hydrogenation, typically used for hydrogenating triple bonds to single bonds. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, adding two hydrogens. So, the structure would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or wait, no. Because the starting material after step 1 is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, converting it to a single bond. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, a propyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, but that would require a different catalyst. So perhaps step 2 is using H2 with a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's, which would give cis-alkene.

Wait, but the options don't specify the catalyst, just H2/Pd. So, perhaps it's fully hydrogenated to a single bond.

Then, step 3 in option C is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But if the alkyne has been hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond to cleave. So maybe that wouldn't work. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents are being used for some other purpose.

Wait, looking at option D:

Steps: NaNH2, methanol → Li, liquid NH3 → O3/(CH3)2S → NH4OH.

Hmm, NaNH2 and methanol: perhaps that's for deprotonating and then quenching, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is making an acetylide, then adding a methyl group, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target molecule's formation in terms of possible reactions.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent, which suggests a coupling reaction, perhaps a cyclopropane formation or some kind of ring expansion.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde via some oxidation.

Wait, another approach: the target has a formyl group, so maybe the alkyne is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, oxidizing an alkyne can lead to a diketone or a carbonyl group. For example, ozonolysis of an alkyne can give a diketone.

But in the target, the aldehyde is a substituent on the main cyclohexane ring, not as a part of a new ring.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is transformed into a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne with NaNH2, form an acetylide, then alkylate to add a methyl group or another substituent.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolyse the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

4. Perform some oxidation or elimination to form the aldehyde and the cyclohexyl substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with O3 or another method), forming a diol.

Wait, but the options don't have dihydroxylation reagents. Let's look at the options again.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → forms an acetylide, then methyl group is added, making a longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, so cyclohexane with a propyl group.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → but wait, if the alkyne was hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond to ozonolyse. So perhaps this step isn't applicable. Unless I'm missing something.

Option B:

Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride → forms an ethylated acetylide.

Then Li and liquid NH3 → this is for elimination, perhaps forming an alkyne again, but I'm not sure.

Then O3 and H2O → ozonolysis, which would cleave double bonds, but if the previous step didn't form a double bond, this wouldn't work.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think in terms of the target structure.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is part of the main cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide or via some other ring-forming reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane via [2+1] addition, but I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a diradical, but that's probably beyond my current knowledge.

Alternatively, think about the reagents in the options. Let's consider each option's steps.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms an acetylide and adds methyl, making a longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to single bond, so cyclohexane with a propyl group.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe for elimination, forming a double bond?

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → this sounds like the oxidation step for the Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones to carboxylic acids, but wait, H2SO4 and HgSO4 are part of the Jones reagent. Alternatively, maybe it's for some kind of oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

But wait, how does the structure after step 3 lead to the target?

After step 2, we have a cyclohexane with a propyl group. Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination, like forming an alkene from an alcohol.

But I'm not sure.

Option C:

Steps 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms an acetylide with a methyl group.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond.

So, the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group.

Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → but there's no double bond here. Unless the hydrogenation didn't go all the way, but that seems unlikely with H2/Pd.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a hydrogenation that adds a hydrogen to form a double bond. But again, with H2/Pd, that's usually for full hydrogenation.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, then quenches with methanol, giving cyclohexane with a CH2-OCH3 group? Not sure. Or maybe it's for some elimination.

Wait, NaNH2 in methanol? Maybe it's forming a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms an acetylide, which is then quenched with methanol to form a terminal alkene. Wait, no, that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me think: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent. So, perhaps the substituent comes from a ring-opening of an epoxide or from a cyclopropane.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, which is then opened to form a diol, which can be oxidized to a carbonyl.

But I don't see epoxide-forming reagents in the options.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene (using H2 with a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar), which is then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with OsO4), forming a vicinal diol. Then, the diol could be oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But in the options, I don't see OsO4, but I do see O3 in some options. Ozonolysis is for cleaving double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps that's part of the process.

Let me outline a possible pathway:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2 to form acetylide.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride → add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne (propargyl group).

3. Partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene (using H2 with Lindlar's catalyst, but the options might not specify that).

4. Ozonolysis of the cis-alkene → cleaves into two carbonyl groups. But since the starting alkyne is part of a cyclohexane ring, this might form a diketone or a carbonyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group as a substituent on the ring. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group in that position.

Alternatively, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave into two carbonyls, which would then be worked upon to form the substituent.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think about the steps in option C:

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to CH2-CH2-CH3. Now, the molecule is cyclohexane with a propyl group.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → but if it's a single bond, no double bond. So, why would ozonolysis be used here? Unless the hydrogenation stopped at the cis-alkene, but with H2/Pd, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is alkyne to alkene, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a catalytic hydrogenation that converts the alkyne to an alkene, not a single bond. Because some catalysts can do partial hydrogenation. So, for example, H2 with Pd might hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene, not a single bond.

If that's the case, then step 3 would be ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 would have a double bond in the middle, after step 2. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out mentally.

After step 1, we have cyclohexane with a propargyl group (–C≡C–CH3).

Step 2: H2/Pd → partial hydrogenation → cyclohexane with a cis-CH2–CH2–CH3, but wait, that's a single bond. No, wait, if the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, it would be a CH2–CH2–CH3 with a double bond between the first two carbons. So, cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3 becomes cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3 with a double bond, but that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is at the end.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cis-alkene, so the structure is cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3, but that's a single bond. Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled, but perhaps looking at the last step in the options might help.

Option C's last step is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, used for elimination reactions, perhaps forming a double bond or epoxide. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the target has a hydroxyl group attached to the substituent. How is that formed? Perhaps via an epoxide ring-opening with water, but I don't see any epoxide-forming reagents here.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl is formed by some dihydroxylation step, like with OsO4, but that's not in the options.

Looking at the steps in option C, after the alkyne is hydrogenated and then ozonolysed, perhaps the product is a diol, which is then oxidized.

Wait, but the product after ozonolysis would be two carbonyl groups. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to form acetylide.

2. Alkylation to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

4. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target's substituent is formed via a nucleophilic attack after forming a good leaving group.

Wait, another thought: the target's substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps that comes from a Grignard reagent attacking a carbonyl group. But I don't see any ketones in the steps.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms an acetylide, which is then quenched with something to form an alkene, which is then oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane via some reaction, but I don't know.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should consider the correct reagents for each step.

The target has a formyl group, so perhaps we need to oxidize an alcohol to an aldehyde. So, maybe the last step is an oxidation using something like CrO3 or other oxidizing agents, but I don't see those in the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C's final steps are O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. So, ozonolysis followed by reductive workup would give aldehydes or ketones, depending on the starting alkene.

Then, after that, Ba(OH)2 is used, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or for forming epoxides.

Wait, let me think about option C's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: makes an acetylide with a methyl group.

Structure after step 1: cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → but there's no double bond here, so ozonolysis would do nothing. So this step might not make sense.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step is partial, but I thought H2/Pd usually fully hydrogenates alkynes.

Wait, perhaps after adding the methyl group, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3, and then hydrogenated to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, how would the next steps form the target?

Wait, perhaps after the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, it's a propyl group attached to the main cyclohexane. Then, in step 3, O3 and (CH3)2S are used. But since it's a single bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, which would require a different catalyst. But the options use H2/Pd, which usually leads to full hydrogenation.

Hmm, perhaps option D is the correct one. Let me think about option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps forms an acetylide, then adds a methanol group. Wait, but NaNH2 and methanol would likely deprotonate and then quench with methanol, possibly giving an alkyne with an OMe group. But I'm not sure.

Then step 2: Li and liquid NH3 → this is a Birch reduction condition, perhaps for aromatic rings, but in this case, maybe it's for deprotonating something else.

Alternatively, Li in liquid NH3 is used for elimination reactions, like forming alkenes from alcohols.

Hmm, not sure.

Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis again.

Then step 4: NH4OH → which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps used in the reductive workup of ozonolysis.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should summarize the problem.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that's a CH2 connected to a cyclohexyl group and an OH. So, perhaps the substituent comes from a cyclopropane opening or from a Grignard reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via Oxidative cleavage. So, the alkyne (after adding a methyl group) is oxidized to form two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via hydration, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → form acetylide.

2. Alkylate → longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate to cis-alkene.

4. Ozonolysis → cleave into carbonyls.

5. Workup → form aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps option C is the correct one. Because after the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, then ozonolysis isn't applicable. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to form a cyclopropane ring, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the target's substituent is formed via some ring-opening after forming an epoxide. But I don't see any epoxide-forming reagents.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the options.

Another approach: the target has a formyl group which suggests oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps introduces an alcohol which is then oxidized.

Looking at the options, step 3 in option C is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of a diene would give a diol, which could then be oxidized. Alternatively, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step in option C doesn't fully saturate the alkyne, leaving a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, but I thought H2/Pd would fully hydrogenate the alkyne. Unless the catalyst is poisoned to stop at the alkene.

I think I'll have to go with option C. Let me explain why.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: form an acetylide and add a methyl group, creating a longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene (maybe using a poisoned catalyst, but the options don't specify). So, the structure becomes a cis-alkene attached to the cyclohexane.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the cyclohexane would now have two carbonyl groups attached.

Wait, but that would create a diketone, which doesn't fit the target.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation leads to a single bond, and the ozonolysis isn't applicable. So maybe option C isn't correct.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps deprotonates the alkyne and then adds a methanol group, forming an ether?

Then, step 2: Li and liquid NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, it could be for deprotonating something else.

Then, step 3: Ozonolysis → but without a double bond, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm out of options. I'll have to make a guess based on the possible steps.

Another possibility: the correct sequence is to form an acetylide, alkylate, hydrogenate to a cis-alkene, then ozonolyse to form a carbonyl, and then perform some oxidation.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis. But if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the target has only one formyl group. So, perhaps only one end is oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the carbonyl groups is further modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps involve forming an enol ether, which is then cleaved.

Another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps the substituent comes from a ring-opening of an epoxide, which comes from an alkene.

Wait, but none of the options have epoxidation reagents.

I'm really stuck, but I think option C is the right one. Because the steps after forming the propargyl group would lead to the necessary substitutions.

Wait, another way: if after step 2, the triple bond becomes a single bond, the structure becomes cyclohexane with a propyl group. Then, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which would do nothing. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride → form acetylide, add methyl → then hydrogenate → Ba(OH)2 for elimination → then Jones oxidation.

Let me think:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → form acetylide and add methyl, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation, which would oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, but I don't see an alcohol here.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, the target has an OH group, so maybe the last step is introducing an OH via some dihydroxylation, but I don't see the reagents.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options and the steps, I'll make an educated guess. I think option C is correct because it involves adding a methyl group, hydrogenating the alkyne, and then using ozone to form carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane using the correct sequence of reagents. The target molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group (OH). The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then alkylated with methyl chloride, resulting in a longer alkyne (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3).
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or to form a double bond.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Jones oxidation, typically used to oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones to carboxylic acids. However, there is no clear intermediate with an alcohol group to oxidize, making this sequence unclear.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then ethylated, resulting in a longer alkyne (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3).
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Likely used for elimination or to form a different structure, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. However, there is no double bond present in the intermediate after step 2.
4. **NH4OH**: A mild reducing agent, but its role in this sequence is unclear.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then methylated, resulting in cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. However, there is no double bond in the intermediate after step 2, so this step would not proceed as intended.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, but its role in this sequence is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then quenched with methanol. The exact product is unclear, but it may involve the formation of an ether or a different structure.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Likely used for elimination or to form a different structure, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. However, there is no double bond present in the intermediate after step 2.
4. **NH4OH**: A mild reducing agent, but its role in this sequence is unclear.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all the options, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible sequence. The steps involve forming an acetylide, alkylating it with methyl chloride, hydrogenating the alkyne to a single bond, and then using ozonolysis and reductive workup to form carbonyl groups. While there are ambiguities in the exact transformations, Option C aligns most closely with the necessary steps to form the target molecule.
