Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to walk through each part.

Okay, the first part is about heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, right? So in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane should eliminate two bromide ions when heated. That would form an alkene between the two carbons where the bromines were attached.

Wait, but wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane — so the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. If they're adjacent? No, wait, in adamantane, the structure is a diamondoid, with each carbon connected in a very rigid framework. So the 1 and 3 positions might not be adjacent. Hmm, that's confusing. Oh wait, maybe in this structure, the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in a way that allows elimination. Or perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, another thought: heating with KOH in a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromo) gives an alkene. But 1,3-dibromo might not be vicinal. Unless in adamantane, they're actually adjacent. Hmm. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with each carbon connected to two others in a tetrahedral arrangement. So 1 and 3 might be two carbons that are connected through a bridge.

Wait, maybe in adamantane, each bridge has a certain arrangement. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two carbons that are two bridges apart. So when KOH is added, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two Brs and forming a double bond.

Wait, but how would that work if the two Brs are not adjacent? Hmm, maybe the structure allows for a bridging elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the formation of an epoxide or something. No, wait, the IR spectrum of the product 1 shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for an ester or a ketone. Oh, wait, no. Wait, 1720 is a carbonyl. Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1740. Maybe it's a ketone, which is around 1700-1725. So product 1 has a carbonyl group.

Hmm, but wait, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, maybe it's more of a substitution reaction. But with excess KOH and heat, elimination is more likely. But the product is a light yellow solid, which might suggest an epoxide? Because epoxides are often formed from dihalides via elimination with bases. Wait, epoxides have an oxygen ring. Let me think. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxide formation typically involves two adjacent halides (vicinal dihalide) undergoing elimination with a base to form an epoxide. So if 1,3 are not adjacent, maybe that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a neighboring group participation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, could it be an alkylation? But with KOH, maybe it's more about deprotonation.

Wait, another angle: the product's NMR. The product 1 has a 1H NMR with a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is likely an -OCH2- group. Then, 2.41-2.23 (10H), which would be the adamantyl groups, and 1.94 (2H), maybe another CH2 group. The IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, perhaps an ester or ketone. Wait, but wait, 4.79 is about 2H, so maybe an epoxide? No, epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm and split into a triplet or something.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is an ether, but the IR peak is more about a carbonyl. Alternatively, could it be a ketone? Let's see. If the product is 1,3-adamantanone, but then the NMR wouldn't have that OCH2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. So the initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with KOH, perhaps it forms an epoxide. But how? Because for epoxide formation, we need a vicinal dihalide. If 1 and 3 are not adjacent, but maybe in adamantane, the positions are arranged such that elimination can form a bridge, making a double bond or an epoxide.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The product is a solid. The NMR shows peaks that probably correspond to an oxygen-containing group. Let's think about the reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Another possibility: perhaps it's a double elimination, forming an alkene. So if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, elimination would form a double bond. But the IR doesn't show a peak around 1650 for a C=C, but it's at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, could it be a ketone? How would that form? Maybe if one Br is eliminated, leaving a carbonyl. But how? Wait, maybe it's an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product's IR has 1720, which is a strong peak, probably an ester or a ketone. So maybe the product is an ester. How could that form from a dihalide and KOH? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, replacing Br with O- groups.

Wait, maybe it's a Williamson ether synthesis? But Williamson typically involves an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. But in this case, KOH would provide an alkoxide, but where would the other alkyl come from? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but I'm not seeing it. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably an oxygenated CH2 group. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether. For example, an epoxide. So if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps on heating with KOH, it loses HBr twice to form an epoxide. But wait, in an epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are connected to adjacent carbons, so the starting dihalide must be a vicinal dihalide. So if 1 and 3 are not adjacent, maybe they're not, so forming an epoxide isn't possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that might require two eliminations, but perhaps that's not likely with KOH. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl group from a substitution.

Wait, maybe the product is a gem-diol, but with KOH, that's unlikely. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling. Wait, but with KOH, perhaps it's more of a nucleophilic substitution. But for a dihalide, perhaps it could form an oxide bridge.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the IR: 1720 cm-1. Could that be an ester? How would an ester form from dibromide and KOH? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an ether somewhere.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that requires an ester and a base. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but the IR doesn't match, as epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Hmm. Then maybe I'm thinking wrong about the reaction.

Wait, let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm is 2H, likely an -OCH2- group. The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which for adamantane, each bridgehead has two CH2 groups, but wait, the total number of H in adamantane is 12 H (each CH2 in adamantane: 4 bridgeheads each with 2 H, and 8 H in the bridges). But in product 1, the 2.41-2.23 is 10 H. So perhaps some of the Hs are split into different regions. Maybe the elimination of Brs leads to a structure where some CH2 groups are adjacent to an oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether with an oxygen in the ring. So maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH to form an epoxide, but I'm not sure about the structure.

Wait, perhaps I should move on to product 2 and see if that gives me any clues. Product 1 is treated with excess Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. Al isopropoxide is often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But considering product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's an acylation. Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, then Al isopropoxide could help in some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide. So maybe product 1 is an ester, and the Al isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some kind of esterification or saponification. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts reaction, but product 1 doesn't seem to have an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, product 1 could be an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide could catalyze some ring-opening. But I'm not sure how that leads to product 2.

Wait, but perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. Then, treatment with Al isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid, could cause it to undergo ring-opening. For example, in acid-catalyzed ring-opening, the epoxide would protonate, and then nucleophiles could attack. But in this case, the reagent is Al isopropoxide, which is a weak acid in some contexts but can act as a proton source.

Wait, but product 2 is then ozonized. Ozonolysis is typically used on alkenes. So product 2 must have a double bond that is cleaved during ozonolysis.

Wait, let me think again. Product 1 has a carbonyl, so maybe it's an alkyne or ketone. Ozonolysis is for alkenes, not ketones. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol or something else with a double bond.

Wait, but if product 1 is an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide is used, maybe it's a ring-opening to form an alkene? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, which upon treatment with a Lewis acid becomes more electrophilic, allowing for some kind of elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline the steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720, NMR as given). So product 1 has a carbonyl group. Perhaps it's an epoxide derivative? Or a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR shows 4.79 for 2H. Let's consider that. 4.79 is about 2H, maybe a -CH2-O- group. Because epoxide protons are usually in the 3.5-4.5 range, but as a singlet or a triplet perhaps.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an ether. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether like an epoxide. Let me think about the NMR: 4.79 (2H) could be the two protons next to the oxygen in an epoxide. But in that case, the coupling would be a triplet because each H is adjacent to two others. Wait, no, in an epoxide, each H is adjacent to two others on the same C, so it would be a triplet. But let me think, if it's an epoxide, then the two Hs on each C would be equivalent, so each would be split into a triplet.

But in the NMR, it's 4.79 (2H), which could be a triplet if that's the case. Wait, but the question says it's 2H in a triplet. Wait, but in an epoxide, each CH2 would have two Hs, but each H is next to two others on the same C, leading to a triplet. So the triplet would integrate for 2H, yes.

So product 1 is an epoxide, which makes sense if the starting material is a vicinal dihalide. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane must have the Brs on vicinal carbons in the adamantane structure, allowing the formation of an epoxide upon elimination with KOH.

So product 1 is an epoxide. That's a plausible conclusion.

Now, product 1 is then heated with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide (also known as TPA, Triphenylphosphine can be used in other contexts, but here it's Al(i-Pr)3). Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is an epoxide.

Wait, but how would Al isopropoxide interact with an epoxide? Maybe it's a ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is undergoing some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. In acid, epoxides can open via nucleophilic attack. But without any other nucleophile, perhaps it's protonating and then rearranging.

Wait, but the product after this step is product 2, which then undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is for alkenes, so product 2 must have an alkene. So maybe product 2 is an alkene.

So how does an epoxide become an alkene after treatment with Al isopropoxide? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is treated under such conditions that it undergoes ring-opening to form a carbocation, which then could lose a proton to form a double bond.

Wait, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid that can coordinate to the epoxide oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then, perhaps a hydride shift or some kind of rearrangement occurs. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is undergoing elimination.

Wait, another approach: perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a ring-opening to form a carbocation, which then rearranges or loses a proton to form an alkene. That would make product 2 an alkene.

So if product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Now, the ozonolysis step: product 2 is ozonolyzed, then worked up with dimethyl sulfide, which is a mild reductant, so it would prevent over-oxidation and give aldehydes or ketones from ozonolysis.

So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. Then, the NMR of product 3 is what's being asked, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange).

But first, let's figure out the structure of product 2.

Assuming product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an alkene, we need to determine where the double bond is.

In the reaction of the epoxide with Al isopropoxide, perhaps the epoxide ring opens to form a carbocation, which then deprotonates to form a double bond. The position of the double bond would depend on the stability of the carbocation formed.

In adamantane derivatives, the structure is quite rigid. So, the epoxide is part of the adamantane structure. When the epoxide opens, the carbocation would form at a position that is most stable. In adamantane, carbocations are most stable at bridgehead positions because of the bridged structure offering some stability (though not as much as in norbornyl systems).

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide's oxygen is at a bridgehead, and the ring-opening leads to a carbocation at a bridgehead, which then loses a proton to form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between two bridgeheads, so the ring-opening leads to a diradical or some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure more clearly. Adamantane's structure is four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, each bridge is a CH2 group, and the bridgeheads are the corners. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on two bridgeheads that are not adjacent. So, when they eliminate, would it form a double bond across the bridge?

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a double bond within the adamantane structure, making an alkene. So product 1 would be an epoxide, but perhaps I'm mixing steps here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene. Wait, earlier I thought the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, but if product 1 were an alkene, the IR would show a peak around 1650 for C=C.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about product 1. Let me reevaluate.

The product 1's IR has a peak at 1720, which is likely a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So if product 1 is a ketone, then how did it form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, where each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would require more than KOH. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but with two Brs, perhaps leading to a geminal diol, but that would be 1,3-diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, maybe the dibromide reacts with KOH in a substitution to form a glycol, but the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides react with a base, they can form an alkene via elimination. So the reaction would be dehydrohalogenation, producing an alkene. But then, the IR would show a peak around 1650, not 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless the product is an ester, but where would the ester come from? KOH isn't an esterification agent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is cyclopropane. No, cyclopropane would have different NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How would that form? Maybe if the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. But that would require the elimination of HBr twice to form a ketone.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Brs. Maybe each Br is eliminated with a β-hydrogen to form a carbonyl. But that would require two eliminations, which might be possible.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. The base (KOH) deprotonates a β-H adjacent to Br, leading to the elimination of Br- and forming a double bond. But if there are two Brs, perhaps two eliminations occur, each forming a double bond. But in adamantane, the structure is rigid, so perhaps both eliminations happen to form a conjugated diene? Or maybe a single elimination forms a diene, but the IR doesn't show that.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated, but in a way that forms a ketone. Wait, but that would require a neighboring group participation, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but that forms a triple bond. But the IR for a triple bond is around 2100, which isn't mentioned here.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about product 1 again.

The NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 ppm (2H) which could be an -OCH2- group. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) are likely the adamantane CH2 groups.

So, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. But then where is the carbonyl in the IR? Oh wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. If product 1 is an epoxide, the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, product 1 could be a ketone. If the reaction is a double elimination forming a ketone, but how?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and each Br is eliminated with a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So each Br is replaced by a carbonyl. But that would require each Br to be on adjacent carbons to a β-H, which might not be possible in adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a single elimination, but from a different structure. I'm getting a bit stuck here, so maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me proceed to the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed, and the product 3's NMR is the focus.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would break the double bond into smaller carbonyl-containing fragments. The splitting in the NMR would depend on the neighboring groups.

Now, the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded would typically be near electron-withdrawing groups, like carbonyls.

In the NMR of product 3, the deshielded H would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, for example, in a ketone or aldehyde, the α-H would be deshielded.

Wait, but the problem specifies that we should exclude Hs that exchange with deuterated solvent, like OH or NH groups. So we're looking for a non-exchangeable H.

If product 3 is a diketone, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded. But how would that couple?

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis produces two aldehyde groups, the α-Hs (if any) would be deshielded. But aldehydes typically don't have α-Hs (since they're RCHO, and R is usually an alkyl).

Wait, but if the alkene in product 2 is between two CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to CH2. So for example, if product 2 is CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules. But that's not likely.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a substituted alkene, like CH2-CH2 with substituents, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, maybe product 2 is a trisubstituted alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each with their own substituents.

Let's imagine product 2 is a diene, but no, ozonolysis of dienes can be more complex. Alternatively, product 2 is a monoene.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (epoxide or ketone, but need to reconcile with NMR and IR).
2. Product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2 (probably an alkene).
3. Ozonolysis of product 2 → product 3 (with carbonyl groups).

Assuming product 3 has a carbonyl group, and the most deshielded H is adjacent to it.

If product 3 is a diketone, then the Hs adjacent to the ketones would be deshielded. Let's say the structure is something like (CH2)n-CO-R, where the Hs on (CH2)n are adjacent to the carbonyl.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H. So if the H is adjacent to two other Hs, perhaps in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, its coupling would depend on neighboring Hs.

Wait, another possibility: if product 3 is a ketone with a CH2 group next to the carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H in that CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the coupling pattern would be a quartet (if it's a single coupling) or more complicated if there are multiple couplings.

But wait, the options given are triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, let me think about a specific example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2(CO), but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, and those CH2s are next to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO=O. Then, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would each have two Hs. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and perhaps two Hs on the neighboring CH2. So each H would have coupling with two sets of Hs: one from the same CH2 (as a triplet) and another from the neighboring CH2 (as a quartet). Wait, but coupling is usually between adjacent Hs, so perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, that would be a triplet of triplets, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 (forming a triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So the overall coupling would be a triplet of triplets, leading to a septet? Wait, no. Alternatively, each H is coupled to two Hs on the same CH2 (so triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet), which would combine into a triplet of triplets, resulting in 3 × 3 =9 peaks, but that's a bit high.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is only coupled to the adjacent CH2, which has two Hs. So each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But that's only one coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each H is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent CH2 and two Hs from another group, leading to a doublet of triplets or similar.

This is getting a bit too vague. Let me think of an example. Suppose product 3 is something like CH2(CO)CH2CH2CO. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone with a propane chain in between.

Wait, another angle: product 2 is an alkene, perhaps a trans-alkene. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. The structure of product 2 would determine the structure of product 3.

If product 2 is a symmetric alkene, the ozonolysis would give identical carbonyl compounds. If it's an asymmetric alkene, it would give different products.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to proceed. However, perhaps the coupling pattern can be inferred based on the possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a structure where the most deshielded H is adjacent to the carbonyl and has two neighboring Hs on each side. For example, a structure like CH2(CO)CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH3. But that's just a guess.

Wait, another thought: if the ozonolysis produces two aldehyde groups, each attached to a CH2 group. So product 3 would have two aldehyde groups. The Hs on the CH2 next to the aldehyde would be deshielded.

In such a case, each CH2 group next to an aldehyde would have two Hs. Each H on this CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same CH2 (so a triplet) and also next to the Hs on the adjacent CH2 (if any). If the adjacent CH2 is another CH2, then each H would have coupling with two Hs from the same CH2 and two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but if the structure is R-CH2-CHO, then the CH2 group next to the aldehyde would have Hs that are split by the adjacent CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 adjacent to aldehyde would couple with two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and two Hs on the neighboring group (if any).

Alternatively, perhaps it's a longer chain. For example, the ozonolysis product could be something like CH2(CO)CH2CH2(CO)R. Then, the middle CH2 would have coupling with both ends.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, the options given are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, considering that, perhaps the most deshielded H is adjacent to a carbonyl and is part of a CH2 group that is next to another CH2 group. Each H would be coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 (a triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). Thus, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets, leading to 9 peaks. But that's not an option; the options include triplet of triplets as option B.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a simpler coupling. If the H is next to a single neighboring CH2 group, each H would be coupled with two Hs from that CH2, leading to a triplet. So that would be option A.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is that each H is coupled with three different sets of Hs, leading to a more complex pattern.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 which is adjacent to another CH2. So each H would be coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with three different groups, leading to a more complex pattern.

I'm not entirely confident, but based on the options, the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH likely results in a double elimination reaction, forming an alkene. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction does not proceed via a simple elimination to form an alkene but instead involves the formation of a ketone or another carbonyl-containing compound. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports the presence of a carbonyl group and an oxygenated CH₂ group, consistent with a ketone or related structure.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   Product 1 is heated with excess Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a rearrangement or further reaction, forming product 2, which contains an alkene. The presence of an alkene in product 2 is inferred because ozonolysis is performed on it in the next step.

3. **Ozonolysis of product 2**:  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with neighboring hydrogens, and the coupling pattern depends on the number of adjacent hydrogens and their spatial arrangement.

4. **Coupling pattern in product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This CH₂ group is also adjacent to another CH₂ group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (forming a triplet) and two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group (also forming a triplet). The overall coupling pattern is therefore a **triplet of triplets**.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.
