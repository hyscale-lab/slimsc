Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me see what I remember about transits and the factors that influence their detectability.

So, the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular, and both host stars have the same radius, even though Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the sizes of the star and planet. Oh wait, but these are Earth-like planets, so the planet size is similar to Earth. But maybe the star's size affects the probability.

Wait, the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = R_p / (R_s * a), where R_p is the planet radius, R_s the star radius, and a is the orbital distance. Or wait, no, I think the probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance's semi-major axis projected in the plane of the sky, and the star's radius. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius over the star's radius, but no, that doesn't sound right. Or wait, the probability is the area of the planet relative to the star, but no, that's for the transit depth. The probability is about the chance that the planet's orbit, when viewed edge-on, causes it to pass in front of the star.

Oh right, the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_s + R_p) / a, but wait, no. Another thought: the transit probability is the area of the star as seen from the planet's position, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit causes a transit is approximately (R_s + R_p) / (a). Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up some factors. Let me think again.

Oh! I remember that the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_s / a), or is it (R_p / a)? Wait, maybe it's (R_s) / (a * (1 + (M_p/(M_s))^(1/3)) )) ), but that's perhaps more complicated. Wait, no, for Earth-like planets, since their mass is much smaller than the star, the M_p term is negligible. So maybe it's just (R_s) / (a).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the formula for transit probability. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of this alignment is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. But wait, I think the probability is roughly (R_s / a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, I think the probability is (R_s + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately R_s / a. So the probability is (R_s / a) multiplied by some other factor, perhaps the inclination distribution. But no, wait, the transit probability depends on the size of the star relative to the orbit. The formula I remember is that the probability P ≈ (R_s / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/(M_s))^(1/3)) ) ), but again, for Earth-like planets, M_p is negligible, so it's roughly R_s / a.

Wait, but wait, another source I recall says that the transit probability is (R_s + R_p) / a. But since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately R_s / a.

So, if that's the case, then the probability is proportional to (R_s / a). But in this problem, both stars have the same radius, R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s. So, since R_s is same for both, the probability depends inversely on the orbital distance a.

Wait, but wait, a is the semi-major axis, which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Oh, right, Kepler's law says P² = (4π²/G(M_s)) a³. So a³ = (G (M_s) P² )/(4π²), so a is proportional to (M_s)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

Wait, but in our case, since both planets have the same mass, but their host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So, M_s1 = 2 M_s2.

And the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P
