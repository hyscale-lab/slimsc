Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their orbital periods detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected these. 

The question is about the orbital periods. They gave the shifts in the spectral lines for each star, and I need to find how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift. The shift in the spectral lines is due to the star moving because of the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the more the star is moving, I guess. But how does that relate to the planet's orbital period?

Wait, the RV method gives a velocity semi-amplitude. So the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by some equation involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) )

But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, which is solar mass, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so it's K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Alternatively, another way I remember it is K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but I might be mixing something up. Alternatively, the formula can be written as K = (v) = ( (27 * 2π^3 G ) / (c^3) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law. Because Kepler's law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the masses.

Wait, but in this problem, since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, but the observed velocity shifts are different. The shift is related to the velocity of the star. So, if the star's velocity is higher, K is larger.

So, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ), but I think I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity. The relation between the velocity (K) and the orbital period (P) is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

But wait, we can factor out the constants. So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

But in this problem, both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), and the stars have the same mass (solar-like). So M_p and M_* are the same for both planets.

So, in this case, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because all the other factors (M_p, M_*, sin i) are the same for both planets. So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but wait, let me get that right. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * C, and K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * C

So K1 / K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

Which is (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, given K1 and K2, we can find P2/P1.

The problem states that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for #2, it's 7 milliangstrom. Wait, but what's the relation between the shift and K?

Wait, the spectral line shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. So, the velocity K is proportional to the wavelength shift. So, if K2 is bigger than K1 (since 7 >5), then K2 = (7/5) K1.

Wait, wait, no. The shift is the amount the wavelength moves. So if the star's velocity is higher, the shift is larger. Because higher velocity means more Doppler shift.

So, K is proportional to the shift. So, K1 =5, K2=7. So K2/K1 =7/5=1.4.

Wait, but earlier we had the relation that K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, let me re-examine that.

Wait, if K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Assuming M_p and M_* are same for both, then K1/K2 = (1/P1)^(1/3) / (1/P2)^(1/3) )

Which is (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, but wait, let's arrange correctly. Let me write the proportionality:

K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3) )

So,

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So, K1 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * K2

Which can be rearranged to P2/P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me take the ratio K1/K2.

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

But in this case, K2 is larger than K1. So K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2 is 5/7.

So, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but wait, that would make planet #2's period about 0.364 times that of planet #1. But that would mean planet #2 has a shorter period. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer the period of planet #2 is than planet #1.

So, if P2 = 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio P2 / P1 is ~0.36. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times longer, but wait, no. Wait, the question is "how many times longer is P2's period than P1?"

Wait, no. Let me re-read the question.

The question: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, if P2 is longer than P1, the ratio is bigger than 1. But in our calculation, P2 is 0.36 times P1, which is shorter. So, the ratio P2/P1 is ~0.36, which is less than 1. So planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

Wait, but that would make the answer option A: ~0.36. But let me make sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me go through the steps again.

Given that K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7.

We have K1/K2 = 5/7.

From the proportionality, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1 = 0.36, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's 0.36 times longer. So the period is shorter, but the question is phrased as how many times longer it is. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought that a larger Doppler shift would imply a more massive planet or a shorter period. Wait, but both planets have the same mass, same star mass. So a larger K would imply a shorter period. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K, lower P.

So if star #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5), planet #2 has a shorter period than planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period? So it's shorter, so the ratio is about 0.36 times, meaning it's about 36% of the period of planet #1. So the period is 0.36 times as long, so the answer is option A: ~0.36.

Wait, but the options include A) ~0.36, which would be the correct answer.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), as given by the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since both planets have similar masses and their host stars have the same mass, the proportionality simplifies to:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

The problem states that the spectral line shifts for planet #1 and planet #2 are 5 milliangstrom and 7 milliangstrom, respectively. Since the shift is proportional to \( K \), we have:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Substituting this into the equation for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.36 \), planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's period by a factor of approximately 0.36.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
