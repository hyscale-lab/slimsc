Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal too. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is d = a / (sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ )) ) but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind for when the lattice is cubic, but rhombohedral is a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

Oh wait, in a rhombohedral lattice, which is a special case of a hexagonal or triclinic system? Wait no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system, but with all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So for a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The interplanar distance formula for any plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the Bragg's law formula. But wait, Bragg's law is for the diffraction, but the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = a * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ) )^(-1/2)

Wait, wait, no. Wait, maybe I have it a bit wrong. I think the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)/(a²)

Wait, but wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) )

Yes, that seems right. So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging in, we get:

d = a / sqrt(1 + 1 +1 + 2*(1*1 * cos 30°) + 2*(1*1 * cos 30°) + 2*(1*1 * cos 30°) )

Wait, because alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So each cosine term is cos(30°). Cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So let's compute the denominator step by step.

First, sum the squares: 1+1+1=3.

Now the cross terms: 2*(hk cos α) = 2*(1*1 * cos30) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3).

But wait each of the cross terms for hk, hl, kl. Because in the formula, each cross term is 2(hk cos α), 2(hl cos β), 2(kl cos γ). But wait, alpha, beta, gamma here are the angles between the axes. So in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So the cross terms each contribute 2*(1*1 * cos30) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). There are three such terms: hk, hl, kl.

Wait, no. Wait, each cross term is 2*(h k cos α), where alpha is the angle between the a and b axes. Similarly, beta is between a and c, and gamma between b and c. So when h, k, l are all 1, each cross term is 2*(1*1 * cos30), so three terms of sqrt(3).

So adding all cross terms: 3 * sqrt(3) ≈ 3 * 1.732 ≈ 5.196.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196).

Wait, 3 + 5.196 is 8.196. The square root of 8.196 is approximately 2.864.

So d = a / 2.864. But wait, the interatomic distance a is given as 10 Angstroms.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a? Or is it different? Because sometimes, the interatomic distance (say, in a simple cubic structure) is equal to the lattice parameter a. But in other structures, it's different. So in a simple cubic, each atom is at the corner, so the edge length a is equal to the interatomic distance. But in a face-centered cubic, the interatomic distance is a*sqrt(2)/2, I think. Wait, but this is a rhombohedral structure, and for the (111) plane, the calculation would be as above.

Wait, but in this problem, a is the interatomic distance. Or is a the lattice parameter? The question says 'interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom'. So in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a' because each atom is at the corner. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is not the same as the lattice parameter. Wait, no, I think in the case of a rhombohedral crystal, each atom is at the corner, so the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice constant a. Wait, or perhaps not. Because in a cube, each atom is at the corner, so the distance between atoms along the edge is a, so the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corner of the rhombohedron. So the interatomic distance along the edge (the edge length) is a. So yes, the interatomic distance is 'a' in this case.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. In a simple cubic, the interatomic distance is a. But in a body-centered cubic, the nearest neighbor is along the face diagonal, which is a√2/2. So in this rhombohedral case, the edges are at 30 degrees, but the interatomic distance along the edge is a. So the given interatomic distance is a=10 Angstrom.

So putting it together, a=10.

Then d = 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.491 Angstrom? Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 9-10 Angstrom. Hmm, wait, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-calculate. Maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

But in this case, h=k=l=1. So:

Denominator inside sqrt is:

1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 )

Which is 3 + 2*( 3*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) 

Wait, wait, because each cross term is 2*(h k cosα) for each pair. So for (111), the cross terms are 2*(1*1 cos30) for hk, 2*(1*1 cos30) for hl, and 2*(1*1 cos30) for kl. So three terms each of 2*(sqrt(3)/2) which is sqrt(3) each.

So sum of cross terms is 3 * sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196.

So total denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

So d = a / 2.864.

Given a=10 Angstrom, then d=10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are around 9-10. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the denominator is in the denominator of the sqrt? Or perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l² + ... ) / a².

Wait, correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ) / a²

Wait, no, I think I had it right earlier. Let me double-check.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

So substituting the numbers:

h=1, k=1, l=1, all angles 30 degrees.

So compute the denominator:

(1+1+1) + 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 )

= 3 + 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2) ) 

Because each 1*1 cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, and there are three terms, each multiplied by 2.

Wait, wait. Wait, the cross terms are 2hk cos α, 2hl cos β, 2kl cos γ.

So with h=k=l=1, each cross term is 2*(1*1)*cos30. So each is 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3).

But there are three cross terms: hk, hl, kl. So 3 * sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

Square root of 8.196 is approximately 2.864.

So d = a / 2.864 = 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are way larger, 8-10. So that can't be right. So I must have messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a, but something else. Wait, maybe the interatomic distance is not along the lattice edges. Hmm, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor separation isn't 'a', but something else.

Wait, in a simple cubic, the nearest neighbor distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along a different direction, so the interatomic distance is not a. Hmm, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this case, the nearest neighbor's distance is given as 10 Angstrom, but the lattice parameter a is different.

Wait, so maybe I should find the lattice parameter a in terms of the nearest neighbor distance, and then compute d.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system with a = interatomic distance, but that may not be the case.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance can be found using the formula involving the lattice parameter a and the angles.

Wait, the distance between two neighboring atoms in a rhombohedral lattice can be found using the formula for the edge length. Wait, each atom is at the corner, so the nearest neighbor would be along the edge, so the distance is a. So in that case, a=10 Angstrom. But then the calculation I did earlier gave d≈3.49 which doesn't match any options.

So that suggests either I made a mistake in the formula or perhaps the question is referring to something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the interplanar distance, but some people might confuse the d-spacing with the interatomic distance. But no, the options are higher, so perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, let's think again. Maybe the formula I'm using isn't correct for rhombohedral systems.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the interplanar distance using the Miller indices and the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric tensor in crystallography is used to compute interplanar distances. The formula for the metric tensor is related to the unit cell parameters. For a rhombohedral system, the metric tensor components are:

a²(1 + cos α) for the (1,1,1) direction?

Wait, perhaps I should construct the metric tensor. The metric tensor g_ij for a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

g_11 = a²

g_22 = a²

g_33 = a²

g_12 = g_13 = g_23 = a² cos α

Wait, since all angles are equal, that's the case.

The interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ) * sqrt( (a²) ( ... ) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ ) / a²

Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, but wait, for a rhombohedral system, since all angles are equal, we can write:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ] / a²

So substituting h=k=l=1, alpha=30 degrees:

1/d² = [3 + 2(3)(cos30)] / a²

So cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So numerator becomes 3 + 2*(3)*0.866 = 3 + 6*0.866 ≈ 3 +5.196 ≈8.196.

Then 1/d² = 8.196 / a².

Wait, but a is the lattice parameter. If the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and a is the lattice parameter, then a=10. So 1/d² = 8.196 / (10)^2 = 8.196 / 100 = 0.08196.

So d² = 1 / 0.08196 ≈ 12.203.

d = sqrt(12.203) ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

But again, the options are all above 8 Angstrom, so something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I inverted the formula. Let me double-check.

Ah, wait, no. The formula is 1/d^2 = ( ... ), so correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about a being 10 Angstrom. If the question says the interatomic distance is 10, which in a simple cubic would be a=10, but in a rhombohedral, the nearest neighbor distance is along a diagonal, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral crystal is not along the edges, but along a different direction.

Wait, in a simple cubic, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, distance a.

In a face-centered cubic, nearest neighbor is along the face diagonal, so distance a√2/2.

In a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along a different vector, like (1,1,0), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length a, but the problem is that the formula gives d as about 3.49, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct denominator is [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2*(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) ) ].

Wait, that's what I did before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again numerically.

Let me compute the denominator:

h² +k^2 + l^2 = 1+1+1=3.

hk=1*1=1, so 2hk cos30 = 2*1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3) ≈1.732.

Same for hl and kl, each gives 1.732.

So sum of cross terms: 3 * 1.732 ≈5.196.

Total denominator inside sqrt: 3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196) ≈2.864.

So d= a / 2.864 = 10 /2.864 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are around 9, so maybe I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the reciprocal of d.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. So perhaps the problem is that the given interatomic distance is not a (the lattice parameter), but the nearest neighbor distance. So perhaps the lattice parameter a is not 10.

Wait, so if a is the lattice parameter, but the nearest neighbor distance is, say, along a different direction. Let's think about that.

In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor could be at a different position. For instance, the vector (1,1,1) would have a length.

Wait, the distance along a vector (hkl) in a rhombohedral system is:

|d| = sqrt( h² a² + k² a² + l² a² + 2 h k a² cos α + 2 h l a² cos β + 2 k l a² cos γ )

But since all angles are alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, this becomes:

|d| = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 hk cos30 + 2 hl cos30 + 2 kl cos30 )

So for the (1,1,1) vector, which is the nearest neighbor, the distance is:

d_nn = a * sqrt( 3 + 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Wait, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, so:

3 + 2 * 3 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So d_nn =a * sqrt(8.196) ≈a*2.864.

But the question says the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor) is 10 Angstrom. So:

10 = a * 2.864 → a =10 /2.864 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

Hmm, that's a different a than before. So if that's the case, then the lattice parameter a is approximately 3.49 Angstrom.

Now, the question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. So the (111) plane's interplanar distance is d = a / [ sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*cos30) ] as before.

Wait, but wait, no. Because we have a new a now.

Wait, if the nearest neighbor vector is (1,1,1), then we can compute a based on the given nearest neighbor distance.

Wait, that's correct. So in this case, the nearest neighbor vector is (1,1,1), so the distance is |d_nn| = a * sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

But the given |d_nn|=10 Angstrom. So:

10 = a * sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) → a = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute 3 + 3*sqrt(3) = 3 +5.196≈8.196. So sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So a ≈10 /2.864 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

Now, the interplanar distance d for (111) is:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) → d= a / 2.864 ≈3.49 /2.864 ≈1.219 Angstrom.

But that's way too small, and none of the options are near that. Hmm, this approach can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the (111) plane isn't the nearest neighbor. Maybe the nearest neighbor is a different plane or direction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the interplanar distance of the (100) plane, but the question specifies (111).

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different approach. Let me think. Maybe I should compute the reciprocal lattice vectors or use another formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the formula. Another way to compute d is using the following formula:

d = (a / (sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )) )

Wait, that's the same as before. So if a is the lattice parameter, which I thought was 10, but that gave a d of about 3.49, which isn't matching the options.

But perhaps the interatomic distance is not along (1,1,1), but along another direction. For example, in a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor might be along (1,0,0), which would have a distance a. So if a=10 Angstrom, then the nearest neighbor is 10 Angstrom. Then
