Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. 

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but when I think about wave functions, they should be normalizable, right? Because the total probability should add up to 1. Oh, but wait, the wave function is given as a function that includes an imaginary part. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe the wave function in this context is a complex function, but when we calculate probabilities, we take the modulus squared, which is the square of the absolute value.

The problem states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this region, but wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because for x less than 1, 1+x would be less than 2. But if x is, say, 0, then sqrt(1+0)=1, so it's a over 1. But if x is less than 1, the wave function is non-zero, but the measurements said no particles there. So perhaps the wave function as given is only valid in the region where x is between 1 and 3.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the modulus squared would be [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, since (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part and 0.5i is the imaginary part. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

But wait, for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. Because outside this region, the wave function is zero (as per the measurements). So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if a is a constant, then the integral would be a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus 0.25 times (3-1). 

Wait, let me compute this. The integral from x=1 to x=3 of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2), which is approximately 0.6931. 

Then the integral of (a²)/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is a² * ln(2). 

The integral of 0.25 from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. 

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1. 

Wait, but that's the condition for normalization. So we have a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1. Solving for a²: a² = (0.5) / ln(2). 

Let me compute that. ln(2) is about 0.6931, so 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is approximately 0.72. So a squared is about 0.72, so a is sqrt(0.72). The square root of 0.72 is about 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. 

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But I thought for a wave function, especially in a bound state, it should be either real or have a time-dependent phase. Hmm, but perhaps in this problem, the wave function is already given in a specific form, and we just need to normalize it. 

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function's real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is [a^2/(1+x)] + 0.25. So the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 must be 1. So the equation I set up earlier is correct. 

So yes, a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1. So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931) → sqrt(0.72) ≈ 0.8485, which is option B. 

Wait but let me double-check the integral. Another approach: The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, because the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So the integral is a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3 plus 0.25*(3-1) = 1. 

Yes, that's correct. So the integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(2), so a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ 0.8485. So the closest option is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particles are only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function must be normalized over this interval. The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), we have:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Substituting these results back, we get:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.72
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.72} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest option to this value is \( a = 0.85 \).

**Answer: B**
