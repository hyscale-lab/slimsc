Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY^2- or something like that. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca^2+ and EDTA (Y^4-) combine to form the complex.

The reaction would be: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). So K = 5e10 here.

But the problem is to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So I have 0.02 M of the complex. I need to find [Ca^2+].

Wait, but in the solution, the complex is in equilibrium with the free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. But since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, it's usually present in excess, right? But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So assuming that the solution is only that complex and nothing else? Or are we considering that EDTA is present in some form?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it. The complex is the main species. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, but the K is so high, the dissociation is minimal. So the [Ca^2+] would be very low.

Wait, but how does this all work? The formula is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Let me denote [Ca^2+] as x. Then, [EDTA^4-] would be approximately equal to x as well, because for each Ca^2+ released, one EDTA^4- is released. Or wait, no. Because the complex dissociates into one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates a little, then the concentration of Ca^2+ is x, and EDTA^4- is also x. Because each mole of complex gives one mole of each. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 - x, but since x is very small (because K is large), 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the equation becomes K ≈ 0.02 / (x * x) → K ≈ 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / K → x = sqrt(0.02 / K).

Let me plug in the numbers. K is 5e10. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = 2/(5e12) → 4e-13. Wait, no, 2e-2 /5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. Wait, no, wait:

0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * (1e-2 / 1e10) )= 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5 → 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 1e-6 * 1e-0.5. 1e-0.5 is about 0.316. So 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately
