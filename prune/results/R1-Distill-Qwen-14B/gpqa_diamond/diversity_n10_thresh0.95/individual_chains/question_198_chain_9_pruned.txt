Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, I remember that stability constants tell us about the stability of metal-ligand complexes. Higher β means a more stable complex. So β1 is the constant for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]+, β2 for the second, like [Co(SCN)₂]^(2+), and so on.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So that's the [Co(SCN)₂]^(2+) complex, which has β2=40. But wait, did I get that right? Or could it be the fourth complex, which has four SCN- ligands? Oh, the question mentions 'dithiocyanato,' which I think implies two SCN- groups. So the β2 is for two SCN-.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the complexes and the stability constants. The stability constants are for each step of complexation. So, for example, for Co^2+ and SCN-:

Co^2+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ , β1=9
[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]^(2+) , β2=40
[Co(SCN)₂]^(2+) + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₃]^3− , β3=63
[Co(SCN)₃]^3− + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₄]^4− , β4=16

Wait, no, the β4 is the next step. So the overall β for a complex with four SCN- would be the product of β1, β2, β3, β4? Or maybe each β is for each successive addition. So the formation of each complex involves adding another SCN-.

But wait, I'm not sure. Oh right, the overall stability constant for a complex with n ligands is the product of each step up to n. Like, for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), the β would be β1 * β2. Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, it's β1*β2*β3, and for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-, it's β1*β2*β3*β4.

But wait, the given βs are probably for each step, not the overall. So the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of β1 to βn, where n is the number of ligands.

So, for each species, their formation constants (β_total) would be:

β1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → β_total =9
β2: [Co(SCN)₂]^(2+) → β_total=9*40=360
β3: [Co(SCN)₃]^3− → β_total=9*40*63= 22680
β4: [Co(SCN)_4]^4− → β_total=9*40*63*16= 362880

Wait, but I should double-check that. Oh, wait no, each β is for each successive addition. So the formation of each new complex is the product of all previous βs. So the β_total for [CoL₂]²+ is β1 * β2.

So, given that, the problem wants the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), which is the one with two SCN- ligands, right? So that would be the species where n=2, with β_total=β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the color. I remember that [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, and [Co(SCN)₂]^(2+) is blue. So the question is about the blue dithiocyanato, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^(2+), so n=2.

Now, the problem is to find the percentage of this species among all cobalt species.

So, to find the distribution of each complex, I'll need to calculate the fraction of each species. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), [Co(SCN)_3]^3−, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4−.

The general approach is to use the formation constants (β) and the concentrations of ligand and metal to find the distribution of each species.

Wait, the formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the formation constants and the ligand concentration. But I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula.

I recall that the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is given by f_n = (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [Co] [L]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^n (β_1 β_2 ... β_k) [L]^k [Co] )

Wait, no, more accurately, the fraction f_n is the concentration of the nth complex divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species.

The equation for the distribution is based on the log terms and the ligand concentration.

Alternatively, the fraction f_n is given by (β^n [L]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^n β^k [L]^k) ), but wait that's when all steps have the same β, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the distribution in terms of each complex's formation constant.

Let me denote:

For each complex [CoL_n]^{2-n}, the formation constant is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

The concentration of [CoL_n]^{2-n} is given by:

[CoL_n] = K_n [Co] [L]^n / (1 + sum_{k=1}^n K_k [L]^k [Co] )

Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to consider the total concentration of cobalt. The total [Co_total] is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoL] + [CoL₂] + [CoL₃] + [CoL₄].

So, [Co_total] = [Co²+] + K1 [Co][L] + K2 [Co][L]^2 + K3 [Co][L]^3 + K4 [Co][L]^4.

Wait, but [Co] here is the concentration of Co²+ in solution, which is part of the total. Hmm, perhaps I should model it using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the fraction of each species using the expression:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 )

Since [Co_total] is given as 0.01 M, and [L] (SCN-) is 0.1 M.

Wait, but [Co_total] is the total cobalt, which is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoL] + [CoL₂] + [CoL₃] + [CoL₄].

So, [Co_total] = [Co²+] + (β1 [Co²+][L]) + (β1 β2 [Co²+][L]^2) + (β1 β2 β3 [Co²+][L]^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co²+][L]^4).

So, factor out [Co²+], we get:

[Co_total] = [Co²+] (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 )

Then, solving for [Co²+] gives:

[Co²+] = [Co_total] / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 )

But since we are to find the distribution of each species, perhaps it's better to compute the fractions.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the formation for each complex and then find their fractions.

The fraction f_n is [CoL_n]/[Co_total].

[CoL_n] = K_n [Co²+] [L]^n, where K_n = β1 β2 ... βn.

So,

[CoL_n] = K_n [Co²+] [L]^n.

But [Co_total] is the sum of all [CoL_k] and [Co²+].

So,

[Co_total] = [Co²+] + sum_{k=1}^4 [CoL_k] = [Co²+] + sum_{k=1}^4 (K_k [Co²+] [L]^k )

Factor [Co²+] out:

[Co_total] = [Co²+] (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 K_k [L]^k )

So,

[Co²+] = [Co_total] / (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 K_k [L]^k )

Once we have [Co²+], we can compute each [CoL_k]:

[CoL_k] = K_k [Co²+] [L]^k.

Then, the fraction f_k is [CoL_k]/[Co_total].

So, the steps are:

1. Compute each K_k for k=1,2,3,4.

K1 = β1 =9.

K2= β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

K3= β1 * β2 * β3=9*40*63= 22680.

K4= β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, let me compute these:

K1 = 9.

K2=9*40=360.

K3=360 *63= 22680.

K4=22680 *16= 362880.

2. Compute the terms sum_{k=1}^4 K_k [L]^k.

[L] is 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term1: K1 [L]^1 =9 * (0.1) = 0.9.

Term2: K2 [L]^2 =360*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: K3 [L]^3=22680 * (0.1)^3= 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: K4 [L]^4=362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum all terms: 0.9 +3.6=4.5; 4.5 +22.68=27.18; 27.18 +36.288=63.468.

So sum_terms =63.468.

Then, [Co²+] = [Co_total]/(1 + sum_terms) = 0.01 / (1 +63.468 )= 0.01/64.468 ≈ 0.00015515 M.

Wait, that's [Co²+], the concentration of free Co²+ ions.

Now, compute each [CoL_k]:

[CoL_1] = K1 [Co²+] [L]^1 =9 * 0.00015515 *0.1 = 9 * 0.000015515 ≈ 0.000139635 M.

[CoL_2] = K2 [Co²+] [L]^2 =360 * 0.00015515 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.00015515 * 0.01 = 360 * 0.0000015515 ≈ 0.00055854 M.

[CoL_3] = K3 [Co²+] [L]^3=22680 *0.00015515 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.00015515 *0.001.

Let me compute 22680 *0.00015515 first. 22680 *0.00015515 ≈ 22680 *0.00015=3.402, but let's be precise: 22680 *15515e-8 = (22680 *15515 )e-8. But perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.

Wait, 0.00015515 is approximately 1.5515e-4.

So 22680 *1.5515e-4 = 22680 *1.5515e-4.

22680 *1.5515e-4: 22680 *1e-4=0.2268. 0.2268 *1.5515 ≈ 0.352.

Then multiply by [L]^3, which is 0.1^3=0.001: 0.352 *0.001=0.000352 M.

So [CoL3]≈0.000352 M.

Similarly, [CoL4] = K4 [Co²+] [L]^4=362880 *0.00015515 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 362880 *0.00015515.

362880e0 * 1.5515e-4 = (362880 *1.5515 )e-4.

362880 *1.5515 ≈ let's compute:

362880 *1.5=544,320.

362880 *0.0515≈362880 *0.05=18,144; 362880 *0.0015≈544.32 → total ≈18,144 +544.32=18,688.32.

So total approximates to 544,320 +18,688.32=563,008.32.

Multiply by e-4: 563008.32e-4=56.300832.

Then multiply by [L]^4 (0.1^4=0.0001): 56.300832 *0.0001=0.0056300832 M.

So [CoL4]≈0.00563 M.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. Let me check this again because that number seems high compared to others.

Wait, [CoL4] = K4 * [Co²+] * [L]^4.

K4=362880, [Co²+]=0.00015515, [L]^4=0.0001.

So:

362880 * 0.00015515 = let me compute 362880 *0.00015515.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

362880 *0.00005=18.144.

362880 *0.00000515≈ 362880 *5.15e-6 ≈ about 1.863.

So total is 36.288 +18.144=54.432 +1.863 ≈56.295.

Multiply by [L]^4=0.0001: 56.295 *0.0001=0.0056295 M.

So [CoL4]≈0.00563 M.

Wait, that's a significant concentration. Let me check all the computed [CoL] values.

Now, let's list all:

[Co²+] = 0.00015515 M.

[CoL1] ≈0.0001396 M.

[CoL2] ≈0.00055854 M.

[CoL3] ≈0.000352 M.

[CoL4]≈0.00563 M.

Wait, but adding all these:

[Co²+] is about 0.000155.

[CoL1]=0.0001396 → ~0.00014.

[CoL2]=0.0005585 → ~0.00056.

[CoL3]=0.000352 → ~0.00035.

[CoL4]=0.00563 → ~0.00563.

Adding all:

0.000155 + 0.00014 = 0.000295.

+0.00056 → 0.000855.

+0.00035 → 0.001205.

+0.00563 → 0.006835.

Wait, but the total [Co_total] is 0.01 M, which is 0.01 =0.01.

But according to that sum, the total is about 0.0068 M, which is less than 0.01. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the [Co²+] calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum_terms.

sum_terms = K1 [L] + K2 [L]^2 + K3 [L]^3 + K4 [L]^4.

Let me compute each term accurately:

K1=9.

Term1: 9 *0.1 =0.9.

K2=360.

Term2: 360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

K3=22680.

Term3:22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

K4=362880.

Term4:362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum_terms=0.9 +3.6=4.5; 4.5+22.68=27.18; 27.18+36.288=63.468.

So sum_terms=63.468.

So denominator=1 +63.468=64.468.

Then, [Co²+] = 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.00015515 M.

That's correct.

So, [Co²+]=0.00015515 M.

Now, let's compute each [CoL_k]:

[CoL1]= K1 * [Co²+] * [L] =9 * 0.00015515 *0.1.

9 *0.00015515=0.00139635; multiplied by 0.1 → 0.000139635 M.

[CoL2]= K2 * [Co²+] * (0.1)^2=360 *0.00015515 *0.01.

360 *0.00015515=0.055854; *0.01=0.00055854 M.

[CoL3]= K3 * [Co²+] * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.00015515 *0.001.

22680 *0.00015515=approx 3.523; *0.001=0.003523 M.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 22680 *0.00015515 = ?

Let me compute 22680 * 0.00015515.

0.00015515 is 1.5515e-4.

22680 *1.5515e-4 = (22680 *1.5515 )e-4.

22680 *1.5515:

Let me compute 22680 *1.5=34,020.

22680 *0.0515≈ 22680 *0.05=1,134; 22680 *0.0015=34.02 → total ≈ 1,134 +34.02=1,168.02.

So 34,020 +1,168.02=35,188.02.

Multiply by e-4: 35188.02e-4=3.518802.

Then, 3.518802 * [L]^3=0.1^3=0.001 → 3.518802 *0.001=0.0035188 M.

So [CoL3]≈0.0035188 M.

Similarly, [CoL4]= K4 * [Co²+] * [L]^4=362880 *0.00015515 *0.0001.

Compute 362880 *0.00015515=?

362880 *0.00015515= (362880 *1.5515e-4) → let me compute 362880 *1.5515= ?

362880 *1=362,880.

362880 *0.5=181,440 → so 362,880 +181,440=544,320.

362880 *0.05=18,144.

362880 *0.0015≈544.32.

So 362880 *1.5515 = 362880 *1 + 362880 *0.5 + 362880 *0.05 + 362880 *0.0015.

Wait, perhaps another approach: 1.5515 =1 + 0.5 +0.05 +0.0015.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 362880 *1.5515 = ?

Let me compute 362880 *1.5 =544,320.

362880 *0.05=18,144.

362880 *0.0015=544.32.

Adding: 544320 +18144=
