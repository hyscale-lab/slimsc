Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii are in a 1.5:1 ratio, and so are their masses. So Star_1 is 1.5 times bigger in radius and 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. Interesting, so same scaling for both radius and mass.

Then, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a star's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

They also mention radial velocities: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, which probably means it's not moving towards or away from us (so we can ignore Doppler shift for Star_1's spectrum), while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but how does that affect the luminosity calculation? Hmm, maybe the Doppler effect could shift the observed wavelength, but since the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, perhaps the radial velocity doesn't affect the calculation of their temperatures? Or maybe the velocities are a red herring and don't impact the luminosity ratio because we're told the peak wavelengths are same, so their temperatures are same regardless.

So the main goal is to find the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2. The question states that the computed luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of which option?

Okay, I remember that the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since we're comparing two stars, we can write the ratio L1/L2 as (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

From the problem, R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 (since their λ_max are same). So substituting, L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T^4 ) / ( R2² T^4 ) = ( (2.25 R2²) / R2² ) = 2.25. Wait, that would give 2.25, which is option A. But wait, the options also have others close to that. Hmm, but wait a second, the problem says the stars are radiating as black bodies, so that formula applies.

Wait, but what about the radial velocities? Because if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, that would cause a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe Star_2's observed λ is shifted due to velocity, but the intrinsic λ is the same as Star_1? Wait, no. Because if Star_2 is moving, its observed λ_max would change, but the problem says both have same observed λ_max. So, unless the velocity is affecting the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the given velocities are their actual velocities, and the problem is about whether their temperature is affected by Doppler shifting. Let me think. If Star_2 is moving towards or away, the observed wavelength is different than the actual emitted wavelength. But the problem says that their "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is same. So if Star_2 is moving, then its actual emitted λ_max would be different, but when observed, it appears same as Star_1.

Wait, but how does that affect the temperature? Let's clarify. The original emitted peak wavelength is λ0 = b / T. But if the star is moving towards us (assuming radial velocity is positive when moving away?), but wait, the problem says Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So velocity is away from us. So the Doppler effect would cause a redshift in its emitted wavelengths. So the observed λ would be longer than the emitted λ.

But in the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So Star_2's emitted λ_max is shorter than what we observe, but Star_1's is the same as observed. So for Star_2, the observed λ is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), approximately, but only if v is much less than c. Hmm, wait, the Doppler shift formula is a bit more complex, but for small velocities, we can approximate it as λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted (1 + v/c), where v is the recession velocity (if positive for moving away). Since 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s), so it's small enough that the approximation should work.

So, for Star_2, the observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c). Similarly, Star_1's observed λ is λ1_obs = λ1_emit. But the problem says λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But wait, the problem says both stars have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So λ1_emit = λ2_emit (1 + v2/c). Because λ1_obs = λ1_emit, and λ2_obs = λ2_emit*(1 + v2/c). So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c ).

But from Wien's law, λ = b / T, so λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2. So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Canceling b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

But wait, because v2 is positive (700 km/s moving away), (1 + v/c) is greater than 1, so T1 = T2 / something >1 => T1 < T2.

Wait, that's confusing. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer, so the observed λ_max would imply a lower temperature. But in the problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So when we say "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest", that's the observed λ_max.

So, let's model it again. For Star_1: observed λ1_max = emitted λ1_max = b / T1.

For Star_2: observed λ2_max = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

But since the observed λ_max are the same:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c )

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

Hmm, so T1 is less than T2? Wait, that can't be, because from the initial data, I thought T1 equals T2, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So for both stars, their observed λ_max is same. So for Star_2, the observed λ is longer (since it's moving away) than its emitted λ. So Star_2's emitted λ is shorter than the observed λ. So Star_2's actual emitted λ is shorter than what we see, which would mean it's hotter than what it appears. So, in reality, T2 is higher?

Wait, let me get this right. If a star is moving away, its light is redshifted. So the observed λ is longer than the emitted. So if Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ_max is longer than the emitted.

So for Star_2, emitted λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c )

Because λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) → λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c )

So for Star_1, λ1_emit = λ_obs.

For Star_2, λ2_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c )

But from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T.

So:

lambda_1_emit = b / T1 → T1 = b / lambda_1_emit = b / lambda_obs.

lambda_2_emit = b / T2 → T2 = b / lambda_2_emit = b / (lambda_obs / (1 + v2/c )) ) = (b (1 + v2/c )) / lambda_obs.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Because T1 = b / lambda_obs, so T2 = (b (1 + v2/c )) / lambda_obs = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

So T2 is higher than T1.

So the temperatures are different. So my initial thought that T1=T2 was incorrect because I neglected the Doppler effect.

Hmm, that changes things because now the temperatures are different.

So, the problem is more complicated than I thought. So the luminosity ratio is not just (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 ), but considering that T2 is higher.

Let me recast the problem.

Given:

R1 = 1.5 R2,

v1 = 0 → Star_1 is at rest,

v2 = 700 km/s (recession velocity, moving away)

Observed λ_max1 = observed λ_max2 = λ_obs.

But the emitted wavelengths are different. So:

For Star_1: lambda1_emit = lambda_obs → T1 = b / lambda_obs.

For Star_2: lambda2_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + v2/c) → T2 = b / lambda2_emit = (1 + v2/c ) * (b / lambda_obs ) = (1 + v2/c ) T1.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

So the ratio T2 / T1 = 1 + v2/c.

Now, let's compute the luminosity ratio.

L = 4π R² sigma T^4.

So L1 = 4pi R1² sigma T1^4,

L2 =4pi R2² sigma T2^4.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

We can substitute R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² = (2.25 R2² )

And T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

So T2^4 = T1^4 (1 + v2/c )^4.

Substituting, L1/L2 = [ (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 ] / [ R2² * T1^4 (1 + v2/c )^4 ) ]

Simplify:

The R2² and T1^4 terms cancel out, so we have:

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c )^4.

Now, compute (1 + v2/c )^4.

v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c.

c ≈ 3e5 km/s → 300,000 km/s.

v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.0023333.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.0023333.

Now, compute (1.0023333)^4.

We can approximate using the binomial expansion for small x.

x ≈ 0.0023333.

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4.

But x is small, so higher terms are negligible.

Let's compute:

4x = 4 * 0.0023333 ≈ 0.009333.

6x² =6 * (0.0023333)^2 ≈6 * 0.000005444 ≈ 0.00003266.

4x³ = 4*(0.0023333)^3 ≈4 * 1.28e-8 ≈5.12e-8.

x^4≈ (0.0023333)^4≈ 2.9e-11.

So adding these up:

1 + 0.009333 + 0.00003266 + 0.0000000512 + 0.000000000029 ≈ 1.0093656.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈ approximately 1.0093656.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute (1.0023333)^4 numerically.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 1.0023333 squared.

(1.0023333)^2 = ?

Calculate 1.0023333 * 1.0023333.

= (1 + 0.0023333)(1 + 0.0023333) 

= 1 + 2*(0.0023333) + (0.0023333)^2 

= 1 + 0.0046666 + ~0.000005444 

≈ 1.004672044.

Now, square that result to get (1.0023333)^4.

(1.004672044)^2 = ?

= (1 + 0.004672044)^2 

= 1 + 2*(0.004672044) + (0.004672044)^2 

= 1 + 0.009344088 + (approx 0.000021822)

≈ 1.00936591.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.00936591.

So (1 + v2/c )^4 ≈ 1.00936591.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00936591.

Compute 2.25 / 1.00936591.

Let me compute this.

1.00936591 is approximately 1.009366.

So 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009366.

First, 1.009366 * 2.23 = ?

Well, 2.23 * 1 = 2.23.

2.23 * 0.009366 ≈ 2.23 * 0.009 = 0.02007, plus 2.23 * 0.000366≈ ~0.000817. Total ≈ 0.020887.

So 2.23 * 1.009366 ≈ 2.23 + 0.020887 ≈ 2.250887.

Ah, that's very close to 2.25. So 2.23 * 1.009366 ≈ 2.25.

Wait, that's the same as the numerator. So 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ approximately 2.23.

So the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but wait, let's check more accurately.

Wait, 1.009366 * 2.23 = ?

2 * 1.009366 = 2.018732.

0.23 * 1.009366 = 0.23215378.

Adding, 2.018732 + 0.23215378 = 2.25088578.

Which is about 2.250886, but the numerator is 2.25, so 2.250886 is just a bit above 2.25. So 2.23 * 1.009366 = 2.250886.

So 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.23 (since 2.23 * 1.009366 ≈2.25, so 2.25/1.009366≈2.23).

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 2.25 / 1.009366.

Another approach: let me compute 2.25 / 1.009366.

I can write it as 2.25 * (1/1.009366).

1/1.009366 ≈ 0.9907.

Because 1.009366 * 0.9907 ≈ 1.009366 * 0.99 = 0.998, plus 1.009366*0.0007= ~0.0007065 → ~0.9987, which is less than 1. Hmm, perhaps a better approximation.

Wait, let's compute 1/1.009366.

We can write it as 1 / (1 + 0.009366) ≈ 1 - 0.009366 + (0.009366)^2 - ... using the expansion 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x +x^2 for small x.

Here x = 0.009366.

So 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x².

x=0.009366 → x² ≈ 0.0000877.

So,

1/(1.009366) ≈ 1 - 0.009366 + 0.0000877 ≈ 0.9907217.

So 2.25 * 0.9907217 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.9907217 = ?

2 * 0.9907217 = 1.9814434.

0.25 * 0.9907217 = 0.247680425.

Adding: 1.9814434 + 0.247680425 = 2.2291238.

So approximately 2.229.

Which is about 2.23. So the ratio is approximately 2.23.

So the answer is option D: ~2.23.

Wait, but initially, without considering the Doppler shift, I thought it was 2.25, but considering the Doppler effect, which made T2 larger than T1, the ratio is slightly less than 2.25, around 2.23. So that's why the correct answer is option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( R_1^2 = (1.5)^2 R_2^2 = 2.25 R_2^2 \).
2. **Observed Wavelengths**: The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)), implying their temperatures are affected by the Doppler effect due to Star_2's radial velocity.
3. **Radial Velocity**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), while Star_2 has \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) (moving away). Using the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

For Star_1, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} \). For Star_2, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c) \). Equating the observed wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)}{1}
\]

From Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = b / T \)):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

### Temperature Ratio:
The relative temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{v_2}{c}
\]

Substituting \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + 0.002333 \approx 1.002333
\]

### Luminosity Ratio:
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \frac{(2.25 R_2^2) T_1^4}{R_2^2 (T_1 \cdot 1.002333)^4}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4}
\]

Using the approximation \((1.002333)^4 \approx 1.009366\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009366} \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.

**Answer: D**
