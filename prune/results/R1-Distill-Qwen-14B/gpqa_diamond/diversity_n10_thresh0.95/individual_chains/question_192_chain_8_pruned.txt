Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. So, the conductor is bigger, and the cavity is somewhere off-center inside it.

Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A to D, each giving a different formula for E.

Hmm. I remember that when you have a charge inside a conducting shell, the charges in the conductor redistribute. But wait, the conductor is uncharged, right? So initially, it has no charge. When we add +q inside the cavity, since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface of the conductor would induce a charge of -q. Because the charge inside the cavity attracts the opposite charge on the conductor's inner surface. But wait, but the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q, because the inner is -q, so the total conductor has 0, the outer is +q.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. The cavity has +q. So the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. Then, since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it. So the conductor's net charge is zero, but the inner is -q, outer +q.

But point P is outside the conductor. So when considering the electric field at P, which is outside, only the charge on the outer surface of the conductor contributes. Because for a conductor, the electric field outside is due to all the charge on the conductor, but wait, the inner and outer surfaces. But actually, the inner surface's charge is shielded inside the conductor, so the outer surface's charge is the one that affects points outside.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So the electric
