Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum in quantum mechanics is represented by matrices, and each component (like Ax, Ay, Az) has its own matrix form.

The question says that the operator Ay is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h divided by 4π. Oh wait, h is Planck's constant. So c = h/(4π), right. And S is given as a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So let me write that matrix out.

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), Ay would be (h/(4π)) times that matrix. So,

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Now, the problem asks me to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Wait, but before doing that, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So I have to analyze each option and see which one is correct.

Let me think about the eigenvalues first. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

But wait, since Ay is proportional to S, maybe I can first find the eigenvalues of S and then scale them by c.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me find its eigenvalues. The trace of S is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - (-(-1)) because i^2 is -1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1? Wait, wait, let me compute determinant correctly.

Determinant of S is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i * i) = 0 - (-i²). Since i² is -1, so this is 0 - (-(-1))? Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step.

-i multiplied by i is -i². i squared is -1, so -i² is -(-1) = +1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1? Wait, no. Wait determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2). i^2 is -1, so -i^2 is 1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1? Hmm, wait, that can't be right because I thought the determinant of S is -1. But wait, let me recheck:

Wait, first element is 0, so (0)(0) is 0. The other term is (-i)*(i) which is -i². So, 0 - (-i * i) = 0 - (-i²). i squared is -1, so -i² is 1. So the determinant is 0 - (1) = -1. Right?

Wait, no, wait a minute. Oh wait no, wait: determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2). i^2 is -1, so -i^2 is 1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1. So determinant(S) is -1.

The trace of S is 0, so the sum of eigenvalues is 0. The product is determinant, which is -1. So the eigenvalues must be λ and -λ, such that λ*(-λ) = -1. So λ² = 1. Therefore, λ would be 1 and -1? Wait, but wait: 1*(-1) = -1, yes. So eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1.

Wait, wait no, because the product is -1. So if the eigenvalues are λ and μ, then λ + μ = trace(S) = 0, and λ * μ = det(S) = -1. So the equation is x² - (trace)x + det = x² - 0x -1 = x² -1 = 0. So x = ±1. Ah, so eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1.

But wait, S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me double-check. So if I compute the eigenvalues, maybe it's easier to just find them.

Alternatively, perhaps S is actually the Pauli Y matrix. Oh wait, I remember the Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y.

Yes, so sigma_y is the Pauli Y matrix, and its eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

Therefore, since Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y, the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * (+1) and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what options are given.

Option A says the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That seems off because our eigenvalues are real, I think. Because S has real eigenvalues, so when multiplied by a real scalar (c), the eigenvalues are real. So Ay's eigenvalues are real. So options that talk about imaginary parts must be wrong.

Option B: imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are h/(4pi) and negative, which are real. So option B's eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be right.

Option C: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, eigenfunctions of A² are the same as eigenfunctions of Ay, since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which for spin-1/2 particles, A² would have eigenvalues (ħ^2 s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A² would have eigenvalues (ħ^2 (1/2)(3/2)) = 3ħ^2/4. So if Ay and A² share eigenfunctions, then the eigenfunctions of Ay are the m states, but I'm not sure. Wait, for angular momentum, the square and the z-component share the same eigenfunctions, but the x and y components don't. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are different. So probably, the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az, but what about A²?

Wait, A² commutes with all components of A, so any eigenfunction of A² is also an eigenfunction of any component of A. But wait, wait, is that true? Because for orbital angular momentum, the square commutes with the components, so the same eigenfunctions can be used. But for spin angular momentum, the same applies. So if a state is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's an eigenfunction of A², because A² commutes with Ay. So the statement in option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which would be correct. But does it say that they can't be eigenfunctions of Az? Hmm, the eigenfunctions of Ay are different from those of Az. Because Ay and Az don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the basis functions of a matrix operator are typically its eigenvectors, right? Because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, especially since it's a 2x2 matrix, which is diagonalizable if it has two distinct eigenvalues. Since our matrix Ay has eigenvalues h/(4π) and -h/(4π), which are different, the matrix is diagonalizable. So the eigenvectors would form a basis. So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, which would be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The basis functions are the eigenvectors. So if the eigenfunctions form a basis, then D is correct. But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the options are about what's correct. Let's reevaluate each option.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts. As we saw, eigenvalues are real, so A is incorrect.

Option B: same issue as A. Incorrect.

Option C: says eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenfunction of Ay is eigenfunction of A². But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2 and diagonalizable, the eigenvectors are a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So the problem is, which statement is correct.

But looking at the options, both C and D might be correct. Hmm.

Wait, let me go back to the problem: the question is, during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

Wait, the options are:

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So let's think about each statement.

Option C is correct: because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² commutes with Ay), but not of Az (since Ay and Az don't commute).

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, for a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues, the eigenvectors form a basis. So the eigenvectors are indeed a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So both C and D seem correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me reevaluate the options. Let me re-read the problem.

Wait, the matrix operator is 2x2, so it's a two-level system. So the eigenvectors will form a basis for the space, so option D is correct.

But then, looking again at the options, which one is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the problem is to find which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps some statements are correct and others are not.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option C: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². As I said earlier, since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions can be the same. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis of the matrix operator. Well, the operator's matrix is 2x2, and in a two-dimensional space, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options are given as A, B, C, D. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements.

But the problem says 'which statement will you consider to be correct', implying only one is correct. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it's a spin-1/2 system. The eigenfunctions are the spin-up and spin-down states along the y-axis. These states are eigenstates of Ay but not of Az, because measuring along y doesn't collapse the state into an eigenstate of z.

Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is the square of the total angular momentum, which is the same for any direction), but not of Az. So option C is correct.

For option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Well, the operator's matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for this space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D seem correct. Hmm.

Wait, but looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to double-check.

Let me compute the eigenvalues of Ay. As we determined, S has eigenvalues 1 and -1, so Ay has eigenvalues c*1 = h/(4π) and c*(-1) = -h/(4π).

So, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ± h/4π. That can't be, because our eigenvalues are purely real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, eigenvalues are real.

So options A and B are out.

Now, options C and D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As discussed, this is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2 and diagonalizable, that's correct.

So both C and D are correct statements. But the options are presented as possible choices, and the question is which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps in the context of the problem, only one is correct. So let me read the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the basis functions of the matrix operator would refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal, which are its eigenfunctions. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements? But the options are given as A, B, C, D, and the question is which is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the matrix Ay is 2x2, so its eigenfunctions are two-dimensional vectors. So they form a basis, making D correct.

But perhaps the statement in option C is also correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct, and the options are:

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay.

So both C and D are correct. But the options in the problem are multiple-choice, so perhaps the intended correct answer is D. Because the problem is about the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, so the statement about the basis is directly related to that.

Wait, but why would option C be correct? Because if the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², that's correct. Because A² is diagonal in the same basis as Ay.

Let me think about the commutator [Ay, A²]. Since A² is (Ay^2 + Az^2 + Ax^2), but wait, no: A is the vector, so A² is Ay² + Az² + Ax². Oh, right. But in any case, for any angular momentum component, A² commutes with each component because they are commuting with each other? Wait, no, that's not right. A² commutes with all components because A² is the Casimir operator, which commutes with each component. So yes, A² commutes with each component.

Therefore, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A², because A² commutes with Ay. So option C is correct.

But in that case, why is option D correct? Because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. So both C and D seem correct.

But wait, the problem is a multiple-choice question, so only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing option D. Let me think again.

The statement in D is: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the term "basis functions of the matrix operator" is a bit ambiguous. But in quantum mechanics, the matrix operator is represented in a particular basis. The eigenfunctions of the operator form a basis in which the operator is diagonal. So for a 2x2 matrix, the two eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But then, if both C and D are correct, but the options are multiple-choice, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, looking back at the question: the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, considering that for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenfunctions of Ay are spin-up and spin-down along y. These are not eigenfunctions of Az because measuring along y doesn't give information about z.

So, since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which is the same for any direction, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

As for D, the eigenfunctions are a basis for the operator's space, so D is also correct. But the question is which is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's a fact about the eigenvectors being a basis. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the question states that the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So perhaps both statements are correct, but the options may not allow that.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says: "during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct?" So perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because during the calculation, you know that the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, another angle: the option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That is correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Ay and Az do not commute, so the eigenfunctions are different.

So I think option C is correct.

Wait, but looking back, the options:

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So the eigenfunctions are same for Ay and A², but not for Az. So this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the operator is represented as a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the problem is structured so that only one option is correct. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the actual calculation steps.

The matrix Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors. The eigenvectors are orthogonal and can form a basis. So D is correct.

At the same time, since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct. But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D. Because when you calculate the eigenvectors, you find that they form a basis, which is statement D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because it refers to the properties of the eigenfunctions.

Wait, but the question is about what you would consider correct during the calculation.

Wait, let me think of the process. You compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So you find that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

So when you're calculating, you would note that the eigenvectors form a basis for the matrix operator, which is statement D. Also, you would find that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is statement C.

But the options are independent. So the correct statements are C and D.

But the options are given as four choices, and only one can be correct. So perhaps in the given options, only option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: the matrix Ay is proportional to the Pauli Y matrix. The eigenvalues are ±1 multiplied by the constant c. So the eigenvalues are real. Therefore, options A and B, which involve imaginary parts, are incorrect.

That leaves options C and D. Since the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², C is correct. And D is also correct. But if only one is an option, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix operator's eigenfunctions form a basis, making D correct.

Wait, but how would you know which one is correct? The question is about the calculation steps.

Wait, during the calculation, when you find the eigenvectors, you recognize that they form a basis for the operator. So D is correct. Also, you'd note that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A². So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, which is a 2x2 matrix. So D must be correct.

But now I'm more confused. Maybe I should think about which statements are correct.

Another approach: looking for any possible errors in the analysis.

Wait, the matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay has eigenvalues ± c, which is ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are incorrect.

The eigenvectors for S (which is sigma_y) are |+y> and |-y>, which are eigenstates of Ay.

These states are eigenstates of A² (since A² is the same in any direction) but not of Az. So C is correct.

As for D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors are a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow multiple choices. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's a fact intrinsic to the matrix operator, while C is about another operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, I think the correct answer is C. Because in the process of finding the eigenfunctions, you would realize that they can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So when you calculate the eigenvectors, you find they're a basis, so D is correct. Also, you realize they're eigenfunctions of A², which is C.

So perhaps the correct options are C and D. But since the problem says only one option is correct, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. But given the options, and that C is about the eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of A² but not Az, which is correct, I think option C is correct.


The problem involves analyzing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator \( A_y \) is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real. This eliminates options A and B, as they incorrectly suggest imaginary parts for the eigenvalues.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**: Incorrect. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), so the claim about imaginary parts (\( \pm 2\pi h \)) is false.

2. **Option B**: Incorrect. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), not \( \pm 1 \) with imaginary parts (\( \pm \frac{1}{2} \)).

3. **Option C**: Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.

4. **Option D**: Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2×2 matrix operator, as the eigenvectors of a diagonalizable 2×2 matrix span the space.

### Conclusion:

Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, the question asks for the statement that is "correct during the calculation." Since the calculation involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the focus is on the properties directly related to the eigenfunctions. Option C highlights the relationship between \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), which is a key insight during the calculation. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Answer: C**
