Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's try to think this through.

The problem says it's a one-dimensional system with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which I know is F = -kx for a spring. The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of the mass. Oh right, and the speed of light is c. Got it.

Wait, so in a regular (non-relativistic) harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv², would be equal to that. Solving for v gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? That's the non-relativistic case. But this question is about the relativistic case, so I can't use that formula directly.

Relativistic mechanics... I remember that in relativity, the energy considerations change. The total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; it's the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, and it's all tied into the Lorentz factor. So, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy. But wait, how does the potential energy fit in?

In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic is (1/2)mv². But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in this case would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic, which is γ mc².

Wait, but the oscillator's potential energy is still (1/2)kA² when x is at maximum amplitude A. But wait, no, actually, in the relativistic context, the potential energy might not be the same as in the non-relativistic case. Or does this problem treat the potential as the same as the classical case? I'm not sure. Let me think.

The problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is the same as in the classical case, right? So the potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA². So the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA².

So in the system, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x = A), all the energy is potential, and when it's at equilibrium (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. Because for a simple harmonic oscillator, energy oscillates between kinetic and potential.

So at maximum displacement, the total energy E is equal to the potential energy, which is (1/2)kA². But wait, in the relativistic scenario, is the rest mass energy part of this total energy? Because the total energy should include both rest mass and kinetic plus potential. Or does the potential energy come from the same source as the kinetic, like the field's energy?

Wait, no, in classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is split between kinetic and potential. In relativity, perhaps that's not the case, because the mass might change due to velocity. Hmm, getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to consider the conservation of energy. The total energy of the oscillator (including relativistic effects) should be conserved. So, when the oscillator is at x = A, it's at rest momentarily, so its velocity is zero. Therefore, its total energy is rest energy plus any potential energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy?

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the energy is E = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx². But relativistically, the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², and the potential is (1/2)kx². So the total energy would be γ mc² + (1/2)kx²? Or does the potential energy also get relativistic corrections? Oh, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the potential energy is (1/2)kA² as in the non-relativistic case, and that the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. Because when the oscillator is at x=A, its velocity is zero, so all energy is potential.

So at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy E is then (1/2)kA² + mc²? Because the rest energy is mc², and the potential is (1/2)kA². Or wait, maybe the rest energy is included in the potential? I'm not so sure.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total mechanical energy is that. The rest mass energy is mc², which is a separate thing. But in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass too. So perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy (relativistic) at x=0 is E = γ mc² - mc², because E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA², and at x=0, potential is zero, so E_kinetic = E_total - mc².

But wait, E_kinetic in relativity is (γ - 1) mc², so:

At x=0:
E_total = γ mc²
But E_total is also equal to mc² + (1/2)kA² (from x=A).

So setting them equal: γ mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Divide both sides by mc²:

γ = 1 + (1/(2mc²)) kA².

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Let me denote (kA²)/(2mc²) as some variable to simplify. Let's say, let’s compute (kA²)/(2mc²) = let's call it alpha. So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

We can write this as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So numerator is 1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha².

Thus,

v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (kA²)/(2mc²). Let me substitute that back.

So,

v² = c² [ (2*(kA²/(2mc²)) ) + (kA²/(2mc²))² ) ] / [ (1 + (kA²/(2mc²)) ) ]^2.

Simplify numerator:

2*(kA²/(2mc²)) = (kA²)/(mc²).

So,

Numerator becomes:

(kA²)/(mc²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Factor out (kA²)/(4 m² c^4) ?

Wait, perhaps better to factor (kA²)/(mc²) as a common factor:

= (kA²)/(mc²) [ 1 + (kA²)/(4 m c²) * (mc²)/(kA²) ) ]

Wait, no, let me compute:

Wait, the numerator is (kA²)/(mc²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) = (kA²)/(mc²) [ 1 + (kA²)/(4 m c²) * (mc²)/(kA²) ) ] Hmm, maybe not the easiest way.

Alternatively, I can factor it as:

(kA²)/(mc²) [ 1 + (kA²)/(4 m c²) * (mc²)/(kA²) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps better to write the numerator as:

[ (4 m c²) * (kA²)/(mc²) + k^2 A^4/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / (4 m c²)

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let me see when alpha is small. Wait, but since the problem is multiple choice, perhaps I can look for an expression that matches one of the options.

Wait, maybe I can write the expression for v_max in terms of the given options without expanding it. Let me work on the expression I have:

v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Where alpha = (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So substituting, the denominator (1 + alpha)^2 is [1 + (kA²/(2 m c²))]^2.

The numerator is 2 alpha + alpha^2 = alpha (2 + alpha) = (kA²/(2 m c²)) [ 2 + (kA²/(2 m c²)) ].

Hmm, perhaps I can factor it differently.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 2 alpha + alpha²:

2 alpha + alpha² = alpha ( 2 + alpha )

But alpha = (kA²)/(2 m c²) is a small quantity if kA² << 2 m c². But perhaps in this problem, that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

So when x = A, the potential is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

At x=0, the potential is zero, so the total energy is E = γ mc².

Setting these equal: γ mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

So, γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Which brings me to the same point as before.

So, gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (kA²)/(2 m c²) as beta. So,

gamma = 1 + beta.

So,

gamma = 1 + beta = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma)^2 = 1/(1 + beta)^2.

So,

v^2 = c² [1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 ].

Which is,

v^2 = c² [ ( (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 ) ]

Expanding (1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta².

So,

v^2 = c² ( (1 + 2 beta + beta² -1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

Simplifying numerator: 2 beta + beta².

So,

v² = c² ( (2 beta + beta²) ) / (1 + beta)^2.

Factor beta from numerator:

v² = c² beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta)^2.

Beta is (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² ( (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) ( 2 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) ) / ( 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) )^2.

Hmm, let me write this as:

v² = c² (kA²/(2 m c²)) * [ (2 + (kA²/(2 m c²)) ) / (1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2)))^2 ) ]

Simplify the fractions:

The first term is (kA²)/(2 m c²).

The second fraction is [ 2 + (kA²/(2 m c²)) ] divided by [ (1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2)))^2 ]

Let me compute the second fraction:

Let me write x = (kA²)/(2
