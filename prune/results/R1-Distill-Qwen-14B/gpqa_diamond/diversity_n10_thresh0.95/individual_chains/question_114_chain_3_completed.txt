Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem has two parts. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part involves treating 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B (in water) to get 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones via something called the Stephen reduction or maybe the Prins reaction? Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, another possibility: the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with a nitrile in the presence of a strong acid. The acid helps protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A. If it's a cyanohydrin formation, then reagent A would be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (sulfuric acid, maybe). Because NaCN is providing the cyanide ion, which acts as a nucleophile.

So in the first step, the product is a cyanohydrin. So the reagent A is probably H3O+.

Now the second reaction: we have a hydroxy nitrile (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the first part, but the second question has a more complex structure) and it's being treated with reagent B in water to get a carboxylic acid. 

Wait, how do hydroxy nitriles turn into carboxylic acids? Oh, I think it's the hydrolysis of the nitrile group. But wait, if it's a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol group, what's the process? Typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed to amides first, then further to carboxylic acids under strong acidic or basic conditions. But wait, the presence of the hydroxy group might influence that.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is being oxidized. Wait, oxidation of nitriles usually requires certain conditions. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 or CrO3 under acidic conditions. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) must have been converted into a -COOH group. So, the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis to form the acid.

Wait, but the reaction is in water. Oh, maybe it's a hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. So, for nitrile to carboxylic acid, I remember that under strong acidic conditions, perhaps with heat, the nitrile can be hydrolyzed. Alternatively, using H2O with a strong acid or base.

Wait, but in the first part, the product after adding NaCN is the cyanohydrin. Then in the second reaction, that's treated with B, which is in water. So the starting material for the second step is a hydroxy nitrile, and it's being converted into a hydroxy carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure would be like (PhCH2C6H4)(OH)CH2CH2CN. But wait, butanenitrile would have four carbons. Wait, the structure is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile attached to a 4-benzylphenyl group.

Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is at the same carbon as the hydroxy group, maybe? Wait, but butanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2COOH. So butanoic acid has four carbons, but in the product, the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the carboxylic acid? Or perhaps it's the second carbon.

Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the structure is probably:

PhCH2C6H4-C(OH)H-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, but butanoic acid is four carbons: CH2CH2CH2COOH. So if the structure is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, that would be CH2(OH)CH2CH2COOH. But the substituents complicate it.

Wait, maybe the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. So if the starting material is a cyanohydrin, which is R2C(OH)CN, then hydrolysis would convert the CN group into COOH, giving R2C(OH)COOH. So that would make it a beta-hydroxy carboxylic acid.

So, how does the nitrile group get converted into a carboxylic acid? Let me think. Normally, the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in acidic or basic conditions. For example, under acidic conditions, using H2O and HCl (like concentrated HCl), might hydrolyze the nitrile to an amide first, then further to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in another approach, the cyanohydrin (R-C(OH)-CN) can be treated with an acid catalyst to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Or maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: the cyanohydrin has a hydroxyl and a nitrile on the same carbon. If we perform hydrolysis, perhaps the nitrile is oxidized. But oxidation of nitriles usually requires specific conditions. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, which would oxidize the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

But in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is in H2O. The options given for B are HCl or CH3COOH. So perhaps B is HCl, acting as a catalyst for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but the first step's reagent A is H3O+ (option A and B have H3O+, options C and D have NaHSO3). So for the first step, the correct reagent is H3O+ because it's a protic acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation.

So for the first part, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense.

For the second reaction, the starting material is the cyanohydrin. So treating it with HCl in water would cause the nitrile group to hydrolyze into a carboxylic acid. Because nitriles hydrolyze in acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. For example, HCl can act as a catalyst for this hydrolysis. So reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → This would fit.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → Not sure if acetic acid would be strong enough.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → Not sure why NaHSO3 would be used as a catalyst for the cyanohydrin.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH → Again, not matching.

Wait, but wait, what about the other possibilities. Could reagent A be something else? Like NaHSO3? If the first reaction is a different kind of addition.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I think that's used in the hydroboration reaction or maybe in the formation of bisulfite adducts, but not for cyanohydrins. So for the first step, the correct acid catalyst is H3O+ (like H2SO4), so options A and B are possible.

So for the second step, B is HCl, which would make option A the correct choice.

Wait, but another thought: in the second reaction, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed in water. Usually, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under strong acidic conditions, like with HCl. So yes, B is HCl.

So putting it together: A is H3O+, B is HCl. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves two reactions. In the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the ketone reacts with the cyanide ion (CN⁻) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid catalyst facilitates the reaction by protonating the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this step.

In the second reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with reagent B in water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires acidic or basic conditions, and HCl is a strong acid that can effectively catalyze this reaction. Therefore, HCl is the suitable reagent for this step.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both steps.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first step, CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile in the second step.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for cyanohydrin formation, as it is not commonly used as a catalyst for this reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither NaHSO₃ nor CH₃COOH is suitable for the respective steps.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
