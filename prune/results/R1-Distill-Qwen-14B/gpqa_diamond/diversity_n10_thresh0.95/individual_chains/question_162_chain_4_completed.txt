Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. Oh right, metrics in two dimensions can sometimes describe surfaces in higher-dimensional spaces. Like maybe a sphere or a pseudosphere, which I think is related to hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, pseudosphere... I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But how does that relate to the metric? Oh, right, the metric's form can tell us about the curvature. So maybe this metric represents a pseudosphere.

So the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, wait. Wait, in the metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So 4 is (2)^2. Oh, that makes sense. So the radius here is 2. Because 4 - x^2 - y^2 is like the equation of a circle of radius 2 in 3D when considering the coordinates x, y, and something else maybe.

But wait, this metric is in two dimensions because it's dx² + dy². So perhaps this is the metric of a two-dimensional surface embedded in three dimensions, like a sphere or a pseudosphere. Wait, but since it's a pseudosphere, it's a surface of constant negative curvature.

So what's the area of a pseudosphere? I'm a bit confused. I know that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which would correspond to a pseudosphere's surface) with radius r is 2π r (cosh(r) - 1). But wait, no, I think that's the area in hyperbolic space for a disc. Or wait, maybe this is a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking about the area of the 2-sphere embedded in some space. But wait, in this case, it's a pseudosphere, so it's a surface with negative curvature, hence the area might be different.

Wait, but looking at the metric, let me think about the line element. ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me try to write this in terms of a line element that I recognize. Maybe it's related to the metric of a sphere or a hyperboloid.

Wait, another approach: perhaps this is a conformally flat metric, because it's expressed as a scalar function multiplied by the flat metric (dx² + dy²). So in conformal coordinates, the area element is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. But since the metric is diagonal and each component is the same, the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Wait, no, the determinant of a diagonal metric is the product of the diagonal elements. Since both terms are multiplied by the same scalar, the determinant would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the square root of the determinant would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). Therefore, the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, the area of the entire pseudosphere would be the integral of the area element over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator 4 - x² - y² must be positive for the metric to be real, so 4 - x² - y² > 0, which implies x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the xy-plane.

Wait, but integrating the area element over x and y would give the area of the surface. Let me set up the integral.

The area A is the integral over x and y of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. So A = ∫∫ [32 / (4 - r²)] r dr dθ, where I'm switching to polar coordinates (r, θ), with r² = x² + y² and dx dy = r dr dθ.

So in polar coordinates, the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the radial integral first. Let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So the radial integral ∫ [32 r / u] dr becomes 32 ∫ (1/u) (-du/2) from r=0 to r=2. Wait, when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the limits change from u=4 to u=0.

So ∫ [32 r / u] dr from 0 to 2 becomes (32/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to 0. Wait, because r dr = (-du/2), so substitution:

Integral becomes (32/2) ∫ (1/u) (-du) from 4 to 0. Which is 16 ∫ (1/u) (-du) from 4 to 0. The negative sign flips the limits, so it becomes 16 ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to 4.

Wait, but ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to 4 is divergent because at u=0, the integral approaches infinity. So the integral becomes 16 [ln(u)] from 0 to 4. As u approaches 0, ln(u) approaches negative infinity, but when you subtract, it's [ln(4) - (-infinity)] which is infinite. So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the options. The options include D) which is +infty. So the area would be infinite, right? So that would mean the correct answer is D.

But wait, what's the pseudosphere? A pseudosphere is an infinite surface in one direction, right? So maybe when you compute the area, it's infinite. So the area is infinite, so the answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a two-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. The metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be expressed as a scalar function multiplied by the flat metric \((dx^2 + dy^2)\). To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we calculate the area element, which is derived from the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. For a diagonal metric, the determinant is the product of the diagonal components. Here, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is therefore:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To find the total area, we integrate the area element over the domain where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\) implies \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), so the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the \(xy\)-plane. Switching to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\) and \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) is straightforward. The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the limits of integration change from \(r = 0\) (\(u = 4\)) to \(r = 2\) (\(u = 0\)). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

However, \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln(u)\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
