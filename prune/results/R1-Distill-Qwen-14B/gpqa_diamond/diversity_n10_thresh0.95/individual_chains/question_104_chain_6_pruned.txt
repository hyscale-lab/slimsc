Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. The planets are in circular orbits. They used the radial velocity (RV) method to detect them.

The key data points: for planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Wait, so I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The Doppler shift depends on the star's velocity towards or away from us. So the shift relates to the velocity of the star in its orbit due to the planet.

The formula I think I need is something involving the velocity of the star (v), the mass of the planet (M_p), the mass of the star (M_s), the orbital period (P), and maybe the distance? Or wait, I think it's Kepler's third law, but adapted for the star's motion.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) )) * (1/( (2π G)^(1/3) )) ) * (sin i ) / ( (1 day)^(-1) )) ). Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the formula is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) )) )

Wait, but e is zero here because the orbits are circular, so (1 - e²) is 1. So that part simplifies.

Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_s (because Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, Sun is 333,000 Earth masses), so M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So we can approximate M_s + M_p as M_s.

So the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_s^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, no. Let me think again. Alternatively, the formula for K is given by:

K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) ) ) )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_s, this simplifies to:

K ≈ (v) ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_s) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think about Kepler's third law in terms of the star's orbit. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The period P is the same for both. The star's velocity is v = 2π a_s / P, where a_s is the semi-major axis (for the star's orbit around the center of mass).

From the center of mass condition, M_s a_s = M_p a_p. So a_s = (M_p / M_s) a_p.

But Kepler's third law states that (a_p^3) / P^2 = G(M_s + M_p) / (4π²). Since M_p << M_s, this becomes approximately (a_p^3) / P^2 = G M_s / (4 π²). So a_p^3 = (G M_s P²)/(4 π²). So a_p = [ ( G M_s P² ) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

But then, the star's velocity is v = 2 π a_s / P.

Substituting a_s = (M_p / M_s) a_p, we have:

v = 2 π (M_p a_p)/(M_s P) ) 

Substituting a_p from earlier:

a_p = [ G M_s P² / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

So:

v = 2 π ( M_p / M_s ) * [ ( G M_s P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 ) / P

Simplify that:

v = 2 π (M_p / M_s) * [ (G M_s P² )^(1/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] / P

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express this in terms of K, the velocity semi-amplitude.

An alternative approach is to remember that the RV method gives us K, the star's velocity. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) ) * ( ( 2π ) / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to express K in terms of the orbital period and other variables.

Wait, the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is proportional to the velocity. So if K is the semi-amplitude velocity, then the shift (measured in miliangstroms) is proportional to K.

So the ratio of the velocities (K1 and K2) would be the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts.

Wait, the wavelength shift is caused by the Doppler effect. The formula for Doppler shift is:

Δλ / λ0 = v / c

But since the velocities are small compared to the speed of light, this is approximately v ≈ c (Δλ / λ0 )

But for the same spectral line (same λ0), the shifts are Δλ1 and Δλ2 for each planet. So the velocities K1 and K2 are proportional to Δλ1 and Δλ2, respectively.

So K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 5 /7

So K1 = (5/7) K2

But from earlier, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_s^(1/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me get that right. The formula I'm thinking of is:

K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_s)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) P^(1/3) ) )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_s, it's approximately:

K ≈ [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_s^(1/3) ) ] * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Alternatively, the formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( ( M_p sin i ) ) / ( ( M_s + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s, so:

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_s^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, perhaps I can also write this as:

K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( M_s^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but in our problem, the two stars are the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. So M_p1 = M_p2 = M_neptune.

So the mass terms cancel out when considering the ratio of K1 and K2. Wait, but wait, no, the problem says both have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p. So M_p cancels out in the ratio.

So K1/K2 = [ (M_p)/(M_s^(2/3)) * (1/P1^(1/3)) ) ] / [ (M_p)/(M_s^(2/3)) * (1/P2^(1/3)) ) ] = ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

Wait, but earlier I thought K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2 =5/7. So putting it together:

5/7 = ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

Wait, no, that can't be right, because K is proportional to velocity, which is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). Let me think again.

Wait, the formula I have is K ∝ (1/P^(1/3)).

So K1 = k * (1/P1^(1/3)), and K2 = k * (1/P2^(1/3)) ), with k being some constant that includes the masses and other terms.

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) ) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3)) / (
