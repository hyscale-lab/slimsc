Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes (probably Co(SCN)_2^2+) among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. The blue dithiocyanato is likely the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. So I need to find what fraction of all Co species is in that form.

Stability constants, right. So the stability constant (β) for a complex indicates how stable the complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is. The formula for the complex is usually [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge), and β is the formation constant Kf = [complex]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n).

Wait, so β1 would be for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (since Co^2+ plus 2 SCN^- gives Co(SCN)_2 with charge 0?), β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- maybe, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or wait, maybe the numbering is different. Wait, the number of thiocyanate ions attached goes up as the subscript. So Co(SCN)_n^(2+ -n?), since each SCN is -1.

But maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+ -n). So β1 is for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^(+1). β2 for n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^(0). β3 for n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^(-1). β4 for n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^(-2).

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands. So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^(0), which is β2=40.

So the problem is to find the fraction of Co in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the species with β2=40.

But wait, how do the stability constants relate to each other? I think we'll have to consider the distribution of Co between all possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ion.

So the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^− + [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

But calculating all these concentrations might be tricky, especially since each formation constant is for a different complex.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using the stability constants and the given concentrations to find the mole fractions.

Wait, I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the formation constants and the ligand concentration. The distribution depends on the stability of each complex relative to the others and the ligand concentration.

But with four complexes, it might get complicated. Maybe we can make an assumption that the dominant species are the ones with the highest stability constants. But looking at the β values: β3 is the highest (63), followed by β2 (40), then β1 (9), and β4 (16). Wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 but higher than β1.

Wait, no: 16 is more than 9. So the order is β3 (63) > β2 (40) > β4 (16) > β1 (9). Hmm, so the most stable is n=3, then n=2, then n=4, then n=1? Or is it the other way around?

Wait no, higher β means more stable. So the highest β is β3=63, so the [Co(SCN)_3]^- is the most stable. Then [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40), then [Co(SCN)_4]^2− (β4=16), and the least stable is [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1=9).

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, so β2=40.

Wait, but if β3 is higher, perhaps the majority of Co is in the [Co(SCN)_3]^- form. But maybe the ligand concentration and the βs interact in a way that the most populated species isn't necessarily the most stable.

Wait, I think the fraction of each species depends on both the stability constant and the ligand concentration. If the ligand is abundant, higher n complexes may be more favored. So with [SCN^-] = 0.1 M, which is relatively high, perhaps the higher n complexes are more populated.

But let me think about how to approach this. The general approach for such problems is to calculate the fraction of each complex species based on their stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction of each species can be found by considering the formation constants and the concentrations.

The fraction f_n of the complex with n SCN^- ligands is given by:

f_n = ( [Co(SCN)_n] ) / ( [Co^2+] + sum_{m} [Co(SCN)_m] )

But calculating each [Co(SCN)_n] can be done using the stability constants.

The expression for each complex:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n

Wait, no. The stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n).

So [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So the concentration of each complex is proportional to β_n * [Co]^2+ * [SCN]^n.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is itself related to all these. Because [Co^2+] = c(Co) - sum_{n} [Co(SCN)_n}.

Wait, but since the solution is 0.01 M Co and 0.1 M SCN, which is not extremely high, but perhaps the assumption that [Co^2+] is much lower than [SCN^-] can be made. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the fraction of each species using the expressions.

The total concentration of Co is c = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n].

Each [Co(SCN)_n} is β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So substituting, c = [Co^2+] + β_1 [Co^2+][SCN]^1 + β_2 [Co^2+}[SCN]^2 + β_3 [Co^2+}[SCN]^3 + β_4 [Co^2+}[SCN]^4.

We can factor out [Co^2+]:

c = [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So [Co^2+] = c / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can compute each [Co(SCN)_n} and then find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

c = 1e-2 M

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So compute the denominator term:

Denominator = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Compute each term:

β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2 [SCN]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4

β3 [SCN]^3=63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

β4 [SCN]^4=16 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Adding all these: 0.9 +0.4=1.3; 1.3+0.063=1.363; 1.363 +0.0016=1.3646.

Plus 1 gives denominator = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.

So [Co^2+] = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ (0.01) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Now compute each [Co(SCN)_n}:

[Co(SCN)_1} = β1 [Co^2+][SCN} =9 *0.004225 *0.1.

Let me compute each:

First, [Co^2+] is approximately 0.004225 M.

Compute each complex:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ =9 * 0.004225 *0.1 =9 * 0.0004225 = 0.0038025 M.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0=40 *0.004225* (0.1)^2=40 *0.004225 *0.01=40 * 0.00004225=0.00169 M.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3}^- =63 *0.004225 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.004225 * 0.001=63 * 4.225e-6 = approx 2.662e-4 M.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2−=16 *0.004225 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.004225 *0.0001=16 * 4.225e-8=6.76e-7 M.

Wait, let me compute these more accurately.

n=1:

9 * 0.004225 *0.1 =9 *0.0004225=0.0038025 M.

n=2:

40 *0.004225 *0.01=40 *0.00004225=0.00169 M.

n=3:

63 * 0.004225 * 0.001=63 * 4.225e-6 = 2.662e-4 M.

n=4:

16 *0.004225 * (0.1)^4 =16 *0.004225 *0.0001=16 * 0.0000004225=0.00000676 M.

So all the complex concentrations are:

n1: ~0.0038025 M

n2: 0.00169 M

n3: 0.0002662 M

n4: 0.00000676 M

Wait, but wait, [Co^2+] is 0.004225 M.

Wait, let's sum all the species:

[Co^2+] =0.004225

n1: 0.0038025

n2: 0.00169

n3: 0.0002662

n4: 0.00000676

Adding these up:

0.004225 +0.0038025 = 0.0080275

+0.00169 → 0.0097175

+0.0002662 → 0.0099837

+0.00000676 → ~0.00999046 M.

But the total Co concentration is 0.01 M. Our calculated sum is about 0.00999, which is very close to 0.01, so this checks out. The small discrepancy is due to rounding during calculations.

So now, the fractions of each species can be calculated by dividing each concentration by the total Co concentration (0.01 M).

Wait, wait. Wait, the total concentration is 0.01 M, and the sum of all species is about 0.00999, which is very close. So the fractions can be found as (each [Co species]) / (0.01).

But actually, the [Co^2+] + sum([Co(SCN)_n}) = 0.01. So each fraction is [species]/(0.01).

So let's compute the fractions:

[Co^2+] fraction: 0.004225 /0.01 = 0.4225 → 42.25%.

n1: 0.0038025 /0.01 = 0.38025 → 38.025%.

n2: 0.00169 /0.01 → 0.169 →16.9%.

n3: 0.0002662 /0.01 → 0.02662 →2.662%.

n4: 0.00000676 /0.01 → ~0.000676 → 0.0676%.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because adding all fractions: 42.25 +38.025 is 80.275, plus 16.9 →97.175, plus 2.662 →99.837, plus 0.0676 →99.9046. So that's about 99.9% of the total, with a small missing 0.0954%. Probably due to rounding errors. Anyway, the fractions are as above.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is the n=2 species, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. From the calculation, that's 16.9%.

Wait, but wait a second. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So according to this, n2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the calculation shows that the [Co^2+] is 42.25%, which is higher than the dithiocyanato species. That seems a bit counterintuitive because the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, which is 10 times higher than [Co^2+], so I would expect more complexation.

But let's go back. Perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator.

Wait, let me double-check the denominator:

Denominator = 1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4.

β1[SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2[SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

β3[SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

β4[SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Adding all: 0.9 +0.4=1.3, +0.063=1.363, +0.0016=1.3646. So denominator is 1+1.3646=2.3646.

Yes, that's correct. So [Co^2+] is 0.01 /2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Then, for each complex:

n1: 9 *0.004225 *0.1 =0.0038025.

n2:40 * 0.004225 *0.01=0.00169.

Wait, but [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M. So fraction is 0.00169 /0.01 = 0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, in the calculation, the [Co(SCN)_3} is 0.0002662, which is 2.66% of the total, and [Co(SCN)_4} is 0.00000676, which is 0.0676%. So the majority is [Co^2+] (42%) and [Co(SCN)]^+ (38%?), wait no, [Co(SCN)]^+ is 0.0038025 →38% of 0.01 is 0.38, so that's 38% → which is 38% of the total.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the fractions.

Let me recalculate the fractions correctly.

Each [Co species] is:

[Co^2+] =0.004225 M.

n1 =0.0038025.

n2=0.00169.

n3=0.0002662.

n4=0.00000676.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

So each fraction is [species]/0.01.

So:

[Co^2+] fraction:0.004225/0.01=0.4225 →42.25%.

n1:0.0038025/0.01=0.38025 →38.025%.

n2: 0.00169/0.01=0.169 →16.9%.

n3:0.0002662 /0.01=0.02662 →2.662%.

n4:0.00000676/0.01=0.000676 →0.0676%.

Adding all:42.25 +38.025=80.275; +16.9=97.175; +2.662=99.837; +0.0676=99.9046%.

So the dominant species are Co^2+ (42%) and [Co(SCN)]^+ (38%), then [Co(SCN)_2] (16.9%), then [Co(SCN)_3] (2.66%), and [Co(SCN)_4} as negligible.

But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is [Co(SCN)_2], n=2. So the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the option D is 16.9%, which is correct according to this calculation.

But wait, why is [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1) the second largest? Because β1 is 9, but [SCN] is 0.1, so β1 [SCN] is 0.9, which is higher than β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.01)=0.4. So the product is larger. So n=1 is more populated than n=2.

Hmm, but β3 is higher than β2. Wait, but [SCN]^3 is smaller, so the product β3 [SCN]^3 is 63*0.001=0.063, which is less than β2 [SCN]^2=0.4.

So the products for the different n's are:

n=1:0.9

n=2:0.4

n=3:0.063

n=4:0.0016.

So the highest product is for n=1, which explains why [Co(SCN)]^+ is the second most abundant.

Thus, the dithiocyanato species (n=2) is 16.9% of the total, option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- **Cobalt concentration**: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **Thiocyanate concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]
  These correspond to the complexes:  
  \([Co(\text{SCN})]^+\), \([Co(\text{SCN})_2]^0\), \([Co(\text{SCN})_3]^-\), and \([Co(\text{SCN})_4]^{2-}\), respectively.

### Approach:
1. **Total cobalt concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]
   \]

2. **Expression for each complex**:  
   The concentration of each complex is given by:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_n}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]

3. **Fraction of each species**:  
   The fraction of each species is proportional to:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \sum_{m=1}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
   \]

4. **Denominator calculation**:  
   Compute the denominator:  
   \[
   1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \, \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4, \, \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063, \, \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016
   \]
   Adding these:  
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

5. **Free cobalt ion concentration**:  
   Using the total cobalt concentration:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c(\text{Co})}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}
   \]

6. **Concentration of each complex**:  
   Compute the concentration of each complex:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] = \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.1 = 0.0038025 \, \text{M}
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.01 = 0.00169 \, \text{M}
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] = \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.001 = 0.0002662 \, \text{M}
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}] = \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.00000676 \, \text{M}
   \]

7. **Fraction of the dithiocyanato complex**:  
   The fraction of \([Co(\text{SCN})_2]^0\) is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0]}{c(\text{Co})} = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} = 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

ANSWER: D
