Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions when it's part of a Ca-EDTA complex.

The problem says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, stochiometric means the ratio is 1:1, right? So each Ca²+ is paired with one EDTA^4-.

The K value given is KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. That's the formation constant, I think. The formation constant (Kf) tells us how stable the complex is. A high Kf means the complex is more stable, so less free ions in solution.

I remember the formula for the formation constant. The complex [CaEDTA]^2- is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4-: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ [CaEDTA]^2-. The Kf is [ [CaEDTA]^2- ] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ).

Wait, but the solution's Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the reaction is 1:1, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would each be much lower, but wait, let me think.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's model the system. Let's say the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

The Kf equation is 5e10 = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But what about the EDTA? Oh wait, in solution, not all EDTA is free. Most of it is bound to Ca²+ in the complex. But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total EDTA would be the sum of free EDTA and the complex. Hmm, but that's a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe we can make an assumption here. Since the formation constant is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable. That means that essentially all the Ca²+ is bound into the complex, and the free [Ca²+] is very low. Similarly, the free EDTA concentration might not be negligible, but maybe we can make an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider only the complex, and the fact that the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me think: Let’s denote the concentration of the complex as [C] = 0.02 M. Then, when it dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

But in reality, the dissociation is minimal because Kf is so large. So [Ca²+] is much less than 0.02, and [EDTA] is also much less than 0.02.

Wait, but let's model it:

Kf = [C]/([Ca][EDTA]) = 5e10.

We need to find [Ca²+]. Let's assume that [Ca] = [EDTA] = x.

Then,

5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x)
=> x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10)
=> x^2 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-14) = 2e-7 M.

Wait, but that's 2e-7 M for [Ca²+], which is 2 * 10^-7 M. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which is about 6.3 *1e-7. Hmm, but my calculation gives 2e-7, which isn't exactly an option. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a second. Maybe I should consider that the EDTA concentration is higher because the solution might have excess EDTA. No, wait. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. That implies that the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. So, [EDTA_total] = [EDTA_free] + [C].

But if Kf is so big, the complex doesn't dissociate much. So [EDTA_free] is much less than [C], which is 0.02 M. So, perhaps [EDTA] ≈ [C] = 0.02 M? Wait no, because [EDTA] would be the free EDTA plus the complex. But in that case, the free EDTA is much smaller, so [EDTA] ≈ [C] for the denominator? Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation correctly.

Let me define:

[C] = 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = y.

So Kf = [C]/(x*y) = 5e10.

But in the solution, the total EDTA is [EDTA_total] = y + [C]. However, [EDTA_total] isn't given. Hmm, so this complicates things because we don't know the total EDTA concentration. Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Does that mean that the total EDTA (free plus complex) is 0.02 M? Or that the complex is 0.02 M, and the total EDTA is higher?

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement: "a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex." Hmm, I think that implies the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the total EDTA is 0.02 M because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So [EDTA_total] = [C] = 0.02 M. Wait, no. Because the complex is made from Ca²+ and EDTA. So the total EDTA would be [EDTA_free] + [C]. But if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, that doesn't directly tell us the total EDTA unless we know how much free EDTA is present.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again. The problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. So [C]=0.02 M.

The Kf is 5e10, which is huge, so the dissociation is minimal. So, [Ca²+] is very small. Let me model it:

Kf = [C]/([Ca][EDTA]).

Assuming that [EDTA] is approximately equal to [C], because the complex is much more concentrated than the free ions. But wait, if [EDTA] is [C] + [EDTA_free], but [EDTA_free] is negligible, so [EDTA] ≈ [C]?

Wait, no. Wait, because EDTA is a ligand, and if the complex is 0.02 M, but the free EDTA is, say, x, and the free Ca is also x (since for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get a mole of each). So [Ca] = x, [EDTA] = [EDTA_total] - [C], but [EDTA_total] is not given. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm not considering that the total concentration of EDTA plus the complex is equal to the initial concentration of EDTA. But the problem gives the concentration of the complex, not the initial EDTA or Ca.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the only EDTA present is the complex. But that can't be right because you need free EDTA to form the complex. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex, and the rest is free EDTA and free Ca²+. But without knowing the total EDTA or Ca, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem assumes that the amount of EDTA and Ca is just enough to form the complex, and nothing more. But that doesn't make sense because the complex is formed from both.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a bit simpler. Let me try to model it again:

The formation of the complex is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ [CaEDTA]^2−.

The Kf is 5e10. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

So, assuming that the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and that the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4- are x and y, respectively.

Then, Kf = [CaEDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) = 5e10 = 0.02/(x*y).

But, without knowing the relationship between x and y, I can't solve this directly. Unless we make an assumption that x = y. Because for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of each ion. So perhaps x = y, meaning [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.

Then, 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2). So, rearranging, x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13.

So x = sqrt(0.4e-13) ≈ sqrt(4e-14) which is 2e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is 2e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which is about sqrt(4e-13). Wait, did I miscalculate?

Wait, let me recalculate:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

x = sqrt(4e-14) = 2e-7 M. So 2e-7. But the options don't have this. Wait, the options are:

A) 2.0e-2

B)5e-3

C)6.3e-7

D)1e-2.

Hmm, my calculation gives 2e-7, but option C is 6.3e-7. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that x = y. Maybe x and y are not equal. Let's re-examine the setup.

Wait, the initial thinking was that [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, so x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-14. x=2e-7.

But perhaps the total EDTA is not fixed, and I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: The problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. Let's think of the complex as being present at that concentration, and the free [Ca²+] is what we're looking for.

The formation constant is Kf = [C]/([Ca][EDTA]).

But without knowing the total EDTA or Ca, perhaps we can make an assumption that the concentration of free EDTA is much higher than free Ca²+? Or vice versa? I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps another way. Let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then, since the complex dissociates to give x moles of Ca²+ and x moles of EDTA^4-, the concentration of free EDTA is [EDTA] = ([EDTA_total] ) - [C].

But wait, the problem doesn't state the total EDTA concentration. Oh, this is getting tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the complex is formed from the given 0.02 M solution, and the free [Ca²+] is negligible compared to the complex. Wait, but I think that's the same assumption as before.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kf expression. Wait, Kf is ( [CaEDTA] ) / ( [Ca²+][EDTA] ), so I have Kf = [C]/(x*y).

But I still need another equation to relate x and y.

Wait, perhaps the total EDTA is the sum of the complex and the free EDTA. Let me define [EDTA_total] = [EDTA_free] + [C].

But I don't know [EDTA_total], so that's not helpful unless I can express [EDTA_free] in terms of [C], which I don't think I can without more information.

Hmm, maybe the problem is intended to be approached under the assumption that the concentration of free EDTA is approximately equal to the concentration of free Ca²+ because they're both products of the same dissociation. So [EDTA] ≈ [Ca²+] = x.

So then, Kf = [C]/(x^2) = 5e10.

So x^2 = [C]/(Kf) = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-14, so x = 2e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is 2e-7 M, which is 2x10^-7. But the options don't have this. Closest is option C: 6.3e-7.

Wait, wait. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me recompute 0.02 /5e10.

0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, that's different. Oh! Oh no, I think I messed up the exponents earlier.

Wait, wait. 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2 /5) * (1e-2 / 1e10) = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13.

Ah, that's where I went wrong earlier. So x^2 = 4e-13, so x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5. What's 1e-6.5? That's 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = approx 6.3e-7 M.

Ah, that's option C! So the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me make sure. So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7, which is 6.3e-7. So option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

### Step 1: Define the given values
- The concentration of the complex is \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\).
- The formation constant is \(K_f = 5 \times 10^{10}\).

### Step 2: Simplify the problem
Since the formation constant is very large (\(K_f = 5 \times 10^{10}\)), the complex is highly stable, and the dissociation into free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) is minimal. This allows us to assume that the concentrations of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) are equal, i.e., \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

### Step 3: Substitute into the formation constant equation
\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]
Substituting \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\) and \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\):
\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \(x\)
Rearranging for \(x^2\):
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]
Since \(10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7}\):
\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated concentration of \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to **Option C**.
