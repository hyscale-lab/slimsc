Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass 1.5 times larger. Oh wait, but mass might not be directly relevant here because the question is about luminosity, which relates more to radius and temperature, I think.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength due to blackbody radiation. So that should relate to the temperature somehow. Oh, Wien's Law comes into play here. Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, another thought: no, because the stars could have different temperatures but same peak wavelengths? No, no, Wien's Law says λ_max is directly related to 1/T. So if λ_max is the same, T must be the same. So T1 = T2. That makes sense.

Now, the stars' luminosities are being compared. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Oh right, because the formula is σ T⁴ multiplied by surface area, which is 4π R².

So, since both stars have the same temperature, the ratio of their luminosities will depend on the square of their radii. Let me write that down.

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) → (R1² / R2²) * 1. Because T terms cancel out.

Wait, wait, no, because the formula is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So when you take the ratio, the 4π and σ would cancel out, leaving (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴). So when T1=T2, it's (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring that gives (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options have 2.25 as option A. Hmm, but wait the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So 2.25 is option A.

But wait, wait. There's another detail in the question. The radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Oh, so Star_1 is not moving towards or away from us, but Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect anything?

Hmm, because when calculating luminosity, it's the intrinsic brightness. But wait, the observed brightness can be affected by velocity, but luminosity is an intrinsic property. Oh, wait, but maybe the observed flux is affected by velocity due to the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards us, it's blueshifted, which would change the observed wavelength, but the luminosity is still intrinsic.

Wait, but in this problem, the astronomers used the wavelengths at which stars appeared brightest to determine their temperatures. Oh, but if a star is moving, like Star_2 has a high radial velocity, would that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength (λ_observed) would be different from the emitted wavelength (λ_rest).

Wait, but the question says that through spectroscopy, the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_max observed for both is the same. But if the stars have different temperatures, their emitted λ_max would be different, but due to Doppler shift, it could appear the same.

Wait, this complicates things. Because if Star_2 is moving, then the observed λ_max would be different from the actual emitted λ_max. So perhaps I was wrong earlier when I assumed T1 = T2. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving, the observed λ_max is same as that of Star_1, which may not be at the same rest frame.

So, let me model this. Let's denote:

For Star_1: no radial velocity, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2: radial velocity v. So λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away. Wait, since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is quite high. But which direction? The problem says 700 km/s for Star_2, but it doesn't specify direction. Oh, wait, the radial velocity is given as 0 and 700. So Star_1 has 0, so it's not moving towards or away. Star_2 has 700. But the problem doesn't specify direction, so perhaps we can assume it's moving away, so positive velocity.

Wait, but the exact sign depends on the Doppler formula. Let me recall: if a star is moving away (positive velocity), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). If it's moving towards us, v is negative, and λ_obs is shorter (blue shifted).

So, the problem states that λ_max for both stars is the same. Let's say λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But Star_1's λ_rest is λ1_rest = λ_obs1, since v=0.

Star_2's λ_obs2 = λ_obs1, but it's λ_rest2*(1 + v2/c) = λ_obs1.

So, λ1_rest = λ_obs1.

λ_rest2 = λ_obs1 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but if v is positive (moving away), then 1 + v/c >1, so λ_rest2 is less than λ_obs1. So the rest wavelength is shorter, which implies higher temperature.

Alternatively, let's write the relationship between the observed and rest wavelengths for each star.

For Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs (given), so λ1_rest = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But wait, from Wien's Law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1_rest = b / T1, λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

λ1_rest = (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

So,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Which implies,

T2 = T1 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that's the relation between their temperatures.

Wait a minute, but if Star_2 is moving away, then (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, which would make T2 less than T1. So Star_2 is cooler than Star_1.

But earlier I thought that because the observed λ_max is the same, the rest λ_max would be different because of velocity, so their temperatures are different.

Hmm, so this complicates things because now the temperatures are different. So the earlier assumption that T1 = T2 was incorrect.

So I need to adjust my approach.

Let me restate the problem:

Given:
- R1 = 1.5 R2
- M1 = 1.5 M2 (but mass might not matter here)
- Both stars have same observed λ_max (λ1_obs = λ2_obs)
- v1 = 0, v2 = 700 km/s
- Luminosity is computed assuming blackbody.

Compute L1 / L2.

So, first, find the actual temperatures T1 and T2.

From the observed wavelengths:

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (since v1=0)
λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c) (v2 is positive if moving away, negative if towards)

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, so:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's Law:

λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) / 1

Wait, no, let's rearrange:

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) * (1/T2)

So, 1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2 → T2 = (1 + v2/c) T1.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

Wait, moving terms:

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2 → T2 = (1 + v2/c) * T1.

So T2 is larger than T1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c).

But wait, v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So v2=700 km/s → v2/c ≈ 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3e3) = about 0.002333.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333 → T2 is slightly higher than T1.

Wait, but that's a small effect. But for this calculation, it's necessary to include it because it's part of the problem.

So now, I have T2 in terms of T1.

Now, the luminosity of each star is:

L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

So, L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴)

We have R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

And T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c) → T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.002333) → T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / (1.002333) ≈ 0.99768.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute that. Let's compute 1 / (1.002333) first.

Approximating 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x. x = 0.002333.

So, 1/(1.002333) ≈ 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667.

But to compute (0.997667)^4, let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute 1.002333^4 and then take reciprocal.

Wait, let's compute (1.002333)^4.

Let me compute step by step:

1.002333^2 = approx (1 + 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 + 0.0000054 ≈ 1.0046714.

Then, square that again: (1.0046714)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.0046714 + (0.0046714)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0093428 + 0.0000218 ≈ 1.0093646.

So, (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.0093646.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1/1.0093646 ≈ 0.99075.

Wait, but wait, because (T1/T2)^4 = (1/(1.002333))^4 = (approx 0.997667)^4. Wait, perhaps I should compute it directly.

Alternatively, to compute (1 - 0.002333)^4:

Using the binomial approximation for (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - nx + (n(n-1)/2)x² - ... 

x = 0.002333, n=4.

So,

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4.

Compute each term:

4x =4 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.009332.

6x² =6*(0.002333)^2 ≈6*(0.00000544) ≈0.00003264.

4x³ =4*(0.002333)^3 ≈4*(0.00000001256)≈0.00000005024.

x^4≈ (0.002333)^4 ≈ approx 2.9e-11.

So, summing up:

1 - 0.009332 + 0.00003264 - 0.00000005024 + 0.000000000029.

Which is approximately 1 -0.009332 +0.00003264 → 0.99070064.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈0.9907.

So, putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1^4/T2^4) = (1.5)^2 * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.9907 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.9907.

2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275, and 2.25 *0.0007=0.001575. So total is approximately 2.2275 +0.001575= 2.229075.

But wait, earlier I thought 2.25 *0.9907 is around 2.227. So approximately 2.228.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is close. Option A is 2.25, which would be without considering the Doppler effect.

Wait, but why did the Doppler effect lower the luminosity ratio? Because the actual temperature of Star_2 is slightly higher than I initially thought, which would increase its luminosity more than Star_1. Wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, L is proportional to R² T⁴. So if T2 is larger than T1, then for the same R, L2 would be larger. But in this case, R1 is 1.5 R2, and T2 is a little larger than T1.

So, Let me re-express L1/L2.

We have:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * (T1/T2)^4.

Which we have as (2.25) * (0.9907) ≈ 2.228.

So L1 is about 2.228 times L2.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which matches this.

Wait, but earlier I thought that without considering Doppler, it would be 2.25, but considering Doppler, it's 2.23. So the correct answer would be ~2.23.

So the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So, the correct answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The ratio of the luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)). From Wien's Law, the observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength and temperature by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

For Star_1 (\(v_1 = 0\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}
\]

For Star_2 (\(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate the rest wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T \)), we find:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{v_2}{c}
\]

Given \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \):

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + 0.002333) \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

### Step 2: Ratio of Temperatures Raised to the Fourth Power
The ratio \( T_1 / T_2 \) is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997667
\]

Raising this to the fourth power:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.997667)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

### Step 3: Ratio of Radii Squared
The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 4: Combine Ratios to Find Luminosity Factor
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Step 5: Match to Closest Option
The closest option to \( 2.228 \) is:

**D) ~2.23**

Answer: D
