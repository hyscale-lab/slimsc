Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has 3 protons normally, and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6, I think. Because Li usually has 3 protons and 3 neutrons would be isotope Li-6, since 3+3=6. So the mass number A is 6.

So the problem is to find the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. Hmm, okay. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy anymore. Oh right, the total energy includes kinetic energy and rest mass energy.

The formula for the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest energy, which is mc². So E = gamma * m0 c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is given as 0.96c, that should plug into the gamma calculation.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy of the collider. So the collider accelerates the nucleus to that speed, so the energy we're talking about is the total energy, which includes kinetic plus rest mass. Or is it just the kinetic energy? Hmm, I think in these contexts, the beam energy refers to the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, the total energy is often what's reported. Wait, like for particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. No, wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think. The rest mass energy is mc², and the total energy is gamma mc². The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So if the question is about the energy of the collider, it's the kinetic energy that it imparts to the nucleus. Because when you accelerate particles, the energy they gain is their kinetic energy. So the total energy is their rest energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c." So I think the question is asking for the kinetic energy. Or maybe the total energy? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, but the options are in the GeV range. Let's get back to the basics.

First, figure out the mass of the nucleus. X is Li-6, so the atomic mass is approximately the mass of 6 nucleons. Wait, each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². So for 6 nucleons, that's 6 * 938 MeV. Let's calculate that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Wait, but wait. The actual mass of Li-6 might be a bit less because of binding energy, but maybe for this problem, we can approximate it as 6 nucleons each at 938 MeV. So m = 6 * 938 MeV/c². Wait, but perhaps I should compute the exact mass using the isotope's mass.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to just use the mass number times the mass of a proton (or neutron), since they are close. So m = A * m_n, where A is 6 and m_n is the mass of a neutron. Alternatively, since protons and neutrons have almost the same mass, perhaps the problem approximates the mass of the nucleus as A * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. Though for Li-6, it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(m_p + m_n). But m_p is about 938 MeV, m_n is about 939 MeV, so each neutron is about 1 MeV heavier, but the difference is negligible for this calculation. So the total mass is about 6 * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV or 5.628 GeV.

But wait, maybe I should use the exact mass of Li-6. Because the actual mass might be a bit different. Let me think. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus can be looked up, but since I don't have a table, perhaps I can recall that the mass is about 6 * 938 MeV minus some binding energy. Wait, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, they just take the mass as 6 * 938 MeV/c², because the binding energy is small compared to the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass, including electrons. Wait, but in a nucleus, the electrons are separate. So for a bare nucleus, I think the mass is approximately A * m_nucleon, where m_nucleon is about 938 MeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps they take the mass as m = (mass number) * (mass of a proton). So m = 6 * m_p. Since m_p is approximately 938 MeV/c², 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

So, moving on. The speed is 0.96c, so gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Let me compute that. v is 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me compute it accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, since 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m c². Wait, but wait. No, the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest energy, which is m c². So E = gamma * m c².

Wait, but m is the rest mass. So m c² is 5.628 GeV. So E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. 5.628 * 3.5714.

Hmm, 5 * 3.5714 is 17.857. 0.628 * 3.5714 is approximately 2.237. So total E is about 17.857 + 2.237 = 20.094 GeV. Wait, but that's the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, but the question asks for the energy of the RHIC. I think the RHIC's energy refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the ion. Or perhaps the total energy? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In accelerator physics, the energy of the beam is usually the kinetic energy. Because when you accelerate a particle, you're giving it kinetic energy. So the total energy is rest mass plus kinetic. So the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1) * m c².

Wait, yes. Let me compute that.

So gamma is around 3.5714, so gamma minus 1 is 2.5714. Multiply by m c² (5.628 GeV) gives 2.5714 * 5.628.

Hmm, let's compute that. 2 *5.628 is 11.256. 0.5714 *5.628 is approximately 3.213. So total KE is about 11.256 +3.213 =14.469 GeV. Hmm, but that doesn’t match any of the options. So perhaps I was wrong in assuming it's the kinetic energy. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, including rest mass.

Wait, the options given are A)18.475 GeV, B)23.069 GeV, C)20.132 GeV, D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, if I used the rest mass as 5.628 GeV and multiplied by gamma 3.5714, I get 5.628 *3.5714 ≈ 20.094 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly higher number.

Wait, but wait. Let me do more precise calculations.

First, let me compute gamma more accurately. v = 0.96c.

So v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Square root of 0.0784: Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) accurately.

0.0784 = 784 * 1e-4. sqrt(784) is 28, so sqrt(784e-4) is 28e-2 = 0.28. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Then, m c² is 6 nucleons, each about 938 MeV, so 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

So E_total = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

Break it down:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.
3.57142857 * 0.628 = ?

Wait, 3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.
3.57142857 *0.028 = ?

0.028 *3.57142857 = approximately 0.09999999996, which is about 0.1.

So 2.142857142 +0.09999999996= ~2.242857142.

So total E is 17.85714285 + 2.242857142 = 20.1 GeV. Hmm, but wait, that would be 20.1 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to this.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me check the mass calculation again.

Wait, the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938.272 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So the exact mass would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = let's calculate that.

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.
3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.
Total = 2814.816 +2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

So m c² is 5.633511 GeV.

Now, let's compute gamma * m c² precisely.

gamma = 3.57142857.

So 5.633511 * 3.57142857 = ?

Let me compute 5 *3.57142857 = 17.85714285.

0.633511 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.142857142.

0.033511 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.033511 *3.57142857.

Compute 3.57142857 * 0.03 = 0.1071428571.

3.57142857 * 0.003511 ≈ approx 0.012547.

So total for 0.033511 is approx 0.1071428571 + 0.012547 = 0.119689857.

So 0.633511 *3.57142857 ≈ 2.142857142 + 0.119689857 = 2.262546999.

So total E = 17.85714285 + 2.262546999 = 20.11968985 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's pretty close. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me do it step by step.

Compute 5.633511 GeV * 3.57142857.

Alternatively, compute 5.633511 *3.57142857.

Let me break it down:

5.633511 *3 = 16.900533.

5.633511 *0.5 = 2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.07142857 ≈ let's calculate 5.633511 *0.07142857.

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14, so 5.633511 / 14 ≈ 0.40239364.

So adding up the three components:

16.900533 + 2.8167555 = 19.7172885.

Plus 0.40239364 gives 20.11968214 GeV.

So E ≈ 20.11968 GeV.

The options:

Option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit higher than my calculation. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise numbers for the mass. Let me get the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 5.6396856 GeV/c²? Wait, no, wait. The mass of a single Li-6 atom (including electrons) is more, but the nucleus is stripped of electrons, so I think the mass is just the sum of the nucleons.

Wait, each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6 (3 protons and 3 neutrons):

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the mass is a bit different because of binding energy. Wait, but in the absence of exact data, we proceed with the sum of nucleon masses.

So perhaps the exact calculation with precise numbers would bring the energy to 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 5.633511 * 3.57142857 with more precision.

Let me use a calculator approach:

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Alternatively, 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Use the exact multiplication.

Hmm, 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me do this:

3.57142857 * 5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 * 0.6 = 2.142857142

3.57142857 *0.03 = 0.1071428571

3.57142857 *0.003511 = ?

Wait, 0.003511 is 3.511e-3.

3.57142857 * 0.003511 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 * 3.511e-3.

= (3.57142857 * 3.511) * 1e-3.

Compute 3.57142857 *3.511:

3 *3=9

3 *0.511=1.533

0.57142857 *3 =1.71428571

0.57142857 *0.511 ≈0.2916.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 3.57142857 *3.511.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *3 =10.71428571

3.57142857 *0.5 =1.785714285

3.57142857 *0.011 =0.03928571427.

Adding them together:

10.71428571 +1.785714285 =12.5

Plus 0.03928571427 is 12.53928571.

Multiply by 1e-3 (because 0.003511 is 3.511e-3), so 12.53928571e-3 = 0.01253928571.

So adding all the parts:

17.85714285 (from 5) 

+2.142857142 (from 0.6) 

=20.00 (approx? 17.857 + 2.143 =20).

Plus 0.1071428571 (from 0.03) → 20.10714286.

Plus 0.01253928571 (from 0.003511) → 20.11968214.

So the total is approximately 20.11968 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close but a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is taken as the mass of lithium-6, including electrons, but that's unlikely since the nucleus would have lost electrons.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass should be calculated using the exact atomic mass minus the electrons.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.94093837 amu (atomic mass units). 1 amu is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.94093837 amu *931.5 MeV/c²/amu = ?

6.94093837 *931.5 ≈6.94093837 *900=6246.845, plus 6.94093837 *31.5 ≈ 218.492. So total around 6246.845 +218.492 =6465.337 MeV, which is 6.465337 GeV.

Wait, but that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons. The nucleus would have a mass approximately equal to the atomic mass minus the
