Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two different reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different combinations for A and B.

Hmm. I remember that in organic chemistry, nitriles can be formed through various substitution reactions. Let's think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? Structure-wise, it's (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), I think it's an example of a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but ketones are usually not very reactive towards nucleophilic addition unless under specific conditions. Oh, wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation occurs when a ketone reacts with a cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. 

So, the reaction would be something like ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the ketone first being protonated to make it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming an oxonium intermediate, which then gets deprotonated to form the cyanohydrin.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or something that can provide H+ to protonate the ketone. Looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ as A, while C and D have NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

But in the cyanohydrin formation, the catalyst is usually an acid. So I think A is H3O+. So that would limit the options to A and B. Now, looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is the cyanohydrin of butan-2-one. So the first part, A is H3O+.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. The typical reactions are:

1. Hydrolysis with H2O and acid (like HCl) to form a carboxylic acid.
2. Hydrolysis with a base, which would give a carboxylate salt, which can then be acidified.

In this case, the reagent B is given along with H2O. So I think it's a hydrolysis reaction where B is the acid catalyst. Alternatively, if B is another acid, maybe it's for the conditions.

Wait, the reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile turning into 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile (-CN) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acid, heat, and water. Alternatively, using aqueous HCl as the catalyst. Another possibility is using H2SO4 as the acid.

Looking at the options, for B, options A and C have HCl as B. Option A says B is HCl, and C says B is HCl as well? Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Wait, option A says B is HCl, option B is acetic acid, C is HCl, D is acetic acid.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). 

Which of these would be suitable for nitrile hydrolysis to acid? I think the typical reagent is concentrated HCl with heat and water. Acetic acid is a weaker acid and might not be strong enough for this reaction. Alternatively, sometimes H2O with H2SO4 is used as the catalyst.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, H2O in presence of HCl is used to hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids. So if B is HCl, that would make sense. So in the second reaction, B is HCl (so option A or C). But wait, option A's A is H3O+ which is correct for the first reaction. So in option A, B is HCl, which would fit.

Alternatively, what if B is something else? Let me think about other possibilities. Could it be that the second reaction uses a different catalyst? Maybe not. I think HCl is the right choice for B.

Wait, but the second reaction has H2O as a reactant as well. So the conditions are aqueous acid (HCl) and heat perhaps. So B is HCl, making option A and C possible. But we already determined that A is H3O+ (or maybe NaHSO3?), wait, no, for the first reaction, we thought A is H3O+.

Wait, let me re-examine the first reaction. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The mechanism requires acid catalysis. So A is the acid. So if A is H3O+, then option A is correct for part A. Then B is HCl, so option A is the overall choice.

Wait, but what about the nitrile hydrolysis? Could it also be done with another acid, like acetic acid? I'm not too sure. I think the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires a strong acid, like HCl, because the nitrile is a relatively unreactive functional group. So using HCl makes sense.

So putting it together: A is H3O+ and B is HCl. That would be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the ketone, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a suitable acid catalyst for this reaction, as it provides the necessary protons. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl, to facilitate the reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weaker acid and is less effective for this transformation. Thus, B = HCl.

Combining these conclusions, the correct option is A: A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
