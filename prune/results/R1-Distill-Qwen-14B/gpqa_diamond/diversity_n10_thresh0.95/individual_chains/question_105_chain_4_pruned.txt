Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about stars with spots and how they affect photometric observations, and it's comparing that to the signal from an exoplanet. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spots must be at 5000K, right? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000.

Now, the problem is about brightness variations. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing changes in the observed brightness. The same setup could mimic an exoplanet's transit, so they're asking what exoplanet radius would cause the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots do.

Wait, but the question says to find the exoplanet radius that would produce the same signal if the star wasn't spotted. So I think we're comparing the relative brightness dips.

First, I need to figure out the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the variation caused by an exoplanet transit.

So, the star's radius is R_sun, and the exoplanet's radius is R_pl. The variation in brightness when a planet transits is given by the formula (R_pl / R_star)^2, right? Because the area blocked is the area of the planet over the area of the star, and since brightness is proportional to area (and area scales with radius squared), that's the dip.

But wait, the star's spots are causing the variation. How does that work? The spots are cooler regions, so when they are on the visible side, they make the star appear dimmer. So the variation in brightness would be the difference between the normal brightness and the spotted brightness as the spots rotate into view.

Wait, but the way the brightness variation works with spots is a bit different. It's not just a simple transit where a part of the star is blocked; the spots are just cooler regions. So when the spots are on the side we can see, they contribute less light. So the total brightness will decrease when spots are visible.

So what's the formula for the brightness variation due to spots? I think the overall change in flux would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas minus the sum when spots are present.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Each spot is cooler. So the flux from the star when spots are visible would be lower. Let's model the star as two regions: the spotted and unspotted areas.

The flux from the star without any spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * 4πR^2 (but that's the total luminosity). When we have spots, part of the surface is cooler. The spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² (since it's one hemisphere, so 2π steradians, but maybe I should think in terms of area fractions).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the average flux per unit area on the star. The unspotted area has a temperature of 6000K, the spotted area 5000K. The filling factor is 0.2, so 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots.

Wait, the hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So the total area of the star is 4πR². The hemisphere is 2πR². The spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². The unspotted area in the hemisphere is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6π R².

So the total flux when the spots are visible would be:

F = (flux from unspotted) + (flux from spotted)

Flux from unspotted area: (1.6π R²) * σ T_unspotted^4
Flux from spotted area: (0.4π R²) * σ T_spotted^4

But the normal flux when no spots are visible (like if the other hemisphere is facing us), F0 is the entire star's flux: 4π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait no, because when the star is rotating, only one hemisphere is visible at any time. So when the spots are on the day side (the visible hemisphere), the flux is as above. When the spots are on the night side (so the other hemisphere is visible), the flux is F0 = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. The total flux without any spots would be F0 = 4π R² * σ Teff^4. But when we're looking at the star, only the hemisphere facing us contributes. So the flux when the spots are on the far side would be F0 = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no, when the star is rotating, the visible hemisphere is half the surface. So without any spots, the flux is F0 = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the flux becomes:

F = (unspotted part) + (spotted part)
= [ (1 - filling factor) * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 ] + [ filling factor * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 ]

Wait, but the filling factor is 20%, so 0.2. So,

F = (0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4) + (0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 )

Then, the average flux when spots are visible is F, and when not visible (other hemisphere is facing us), it's F0 = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the change in flux (F - F0) will cause the brightness to vary.

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the spots come into view and then go out of view as the star spins. So the maximum change in brightness will be when the spots are on the visible side.

So the brightness variation ΔF is F0 - F, because F is less than F0. Wait, no. Because when the spots are in view, the flux is less than F0.

So the maximum drop in flux is F0 - F? Or is F the flux when spots are present, which is lower.

Wait, F is when spots are present. So the change is F - F0 (which would be negative) but in terms of magnitude, the change is F0 - F.

So the variation amplitude is (F0 - F) / F0.

Let me compute this.

Compute F:

F = 2π R² σ [ 0.8 * (6000)^4 + 0.2 * (5000)^4 ]

F0 = 2π R² σ (6000)^4

So,

(F0 - F)/F0 = 1 - [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)] / (6000^4 )

Factor out 6000^4:

= 1 - [0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4: (5/6)^4. Let me compute that.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333. So (0.8333)^4.

0.8333 squared is about 0.6944. Squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So 0.2 * 0.4823 ≈ 0.0
