Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

The key data given are the spectral line shifts. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us. So, a larger shift means a higher velocity.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )) ) * (1/(2π)) ), but wait, since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun, M_planet is negligible compared to M_star. So, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, which is the mass of the star, same for both planets here.

So the formula simplifies. Let me rewrite K in terms of the known variables. Since K is the velocity, from RV method. And we have K proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) ). Wait, because let me think. The formula I think is K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / (2π) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) ). But since e is zero (circular orbits), the sqrt(1 - e²) is 1. So that part goes away.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recall the version of the RV formula where K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) * sqrt(P)) )^{-1}? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember the formula as K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1) / ( (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) * (2π) )) ). Wait, perhaps I should find a better way.

Wait, a more straightforward approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ] * [ 1 / ( (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) ) ) ] / (2π) )

But since e is 0, the equation simplifies to:

K = [ (G * M_p) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) ] * [ 1 / sqrt(P) ) ] / (2π)

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Let me check a standard formula. Oh right, from the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * P ) / (2π c ) )^(1/3) ) * [ M_p sin i ] ] / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, the denominator becomes (M_*)^(2/3).

So, K ≈ ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p ) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * 2π c ) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a proportionality. Since both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), and the stars have the same mass, the ratio of their K velocities should be related to the inverse cube root of their orbital periods.

Wait, let me think of the equation again. Since K is the velocity of the star due to the planet. So, K is directly proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / sqrt(P)) ), but because M_p is same for both, and M_* same, perhaps it's more about the relation between their K values and P.

Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period P and the mass of the planet M_p via the formula:

K = (v) = ( (27 * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) (P)^(1/3) )

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the formula as K ∝ (M_p) / (M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the ratio of the velocities.

Let me denote the two planets as planet 1 and planet 2.

Given:

K1 = 5 milliangstroms.

K2 = 7 milliangstroms.

We need to find (P2 / P1).

But since K is proportional to (M_p / sqrt(P)) ), assuming all else is the same.

Wait, no, more accurately, I think K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me think in terms of scaling.

The formula is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_* )^(2/3) ) ) * (1) ) / ( (2π P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, that seems a bit off. Maybe an alternative approach.

Another approach is to look at the Doppler shift formula. The velocity K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, so K is proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because the RV method depends on the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, I remember that for a given star mass, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Since M_p is the same for both planets (same mass as Neptune), and M_* is the same for both stars, the ratio of K1 and K2 will be inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

But in the problem, K2 is larger than K1 (7 vs 5). So, K2 = 7, K1 =5, so (K2/K1) = 7/5 = 1.4.

But since K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)), the ratio of K's is inversely proportional to the ratio of the cube roots of the periods. So,

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, let me write it as:

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So,

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3).

Thus, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, (5/7) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, wait, that would be K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Let me recheck:

If K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then K1 = A / P1^(1/3), K2 = A / P2^(1/3), where A is a constant.

Then, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait no, because if K1 = A / P1^(1/3), then P1^(1/3) = A / K1.

Similarly, P2^(1/3) = A / K2.

So, (P2/P1) = ( (A/K2) / (A/K1) )^3 = (K1/K2)^3.

So,

P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Which means the period of planet 2 is (K1/K2)^3 times that of planet 1.

Wait, no, wait. Because P is proportional to (1/K)^3, so if K2 is larger than K1, P2 would be smaller than P1. Because a higher K (velocity) implies a shorter period.

So, the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

So, K1 =5, K2=7.

So, (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So, P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36 times. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Which means P2 is shorter, so it's orbiting faster. Therefore, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. If P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means P2 is shorter, so P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, P2 is shorter, so the factor is less than one.

So, the ratio P2/P1 is approximately 0.36 times. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't get the ratio backwards.

Wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, if P2 is 0.36 * P1, that means it's shorter. So, planet 2 has a shorter orbital period than planet 1. So, the answer is 0.36 times as long, meaning 0.36 times longer. So, it's about 0.36 times.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait but let me double-check the proportionality.

K ∝ (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Since M_p and M_* are same for both, the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So,

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So, P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1.

5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1, which means it's 0.36 times as long. So, the answer is 0.36 times longer, so the correct choice is A.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given the radial velocity (RV) shifts caused by the planets. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{M_p}{M_*^{1/3} P^{1/3}} \), where \( M_p \) is the planet's mass, \( M_* \) is the star's mass, and \( P \) is the orbital period. Since both planets have the same mass and orbit stars with the same mass, the ratio of their \( K \)-values depends only on the cube root of their orbital periods.

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \),
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \),

the ratio of their \( K \)-values is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

From the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1, meaning it is about 0.36 times as long. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
