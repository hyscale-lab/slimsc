Okay, I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, the question gives me five stars with various properties, and I need to determine which ones are observable by both instruments. Both spectrographs have different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17 mag, while HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So, a star must be bright enough to be seen by both, meaning its apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 mag because HIRES is the stricter limit.

But wait, the apparent magnitude isn't given for all stars. Some have absolute magnitudes, and others have distances or extinction values. Hmm. I remember that absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs, and apparent magnitude depends on distance and any extinction (dust) which makes stars appear dimmer.

So, for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude. Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, located at 10 pc. Since absolute magnitude is what it would be at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is the same. So V =15.5. Can ESPRESSO see it? Yes, as it's below 17. HIRES requires V <=16? 15.5 is less than 16, so HIRES can also see it. So Star1 is detectable by both. Wait, but I need to check another factor—wait, Star1's location is RA 15, DEC -75. Do the observatories have the same visibility? Wait, the question says to disregard pointing limits and altitude, so I don't need to worry about that.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. HIRES can go up to 16, so this is beyond—since it's 16.5, HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, as 16.5 <17. So Star2 only ESPRESSO can detect. So it's not a candidate for being in both.

Star3: V mag is apparent 15.5, but there's E(B-V)=0.6. Oh wait, E(B-V) is the color excess, which relates to interstellar extinction. So the star is dimmed by extinction, which increases its apparent magnitude. Because the formula is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av = 3.1 * 0.6=1.86 mag. So the true apparent magnitude (without extinction) would have been lower. But wait, wait. The given apparent magnitude is already the observed one, including extinction? Or is it the intrinsic? Hmm, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) =0.6". So I think the apparent magnitude is what's observed, which is higher than the intrinsic. Wait, no. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, no. The star's light is dimmed by interstellar dust, so the observed apparent magnitude is brighter than the intrinsic. Wait, no, wait. Extinction makes stars appear fainter. Because dust scatters or absorbs the light, so the star appears dimmer (higher apparent magnitude). Wait, actually, no. Wait, no, stars behind dust appear dimmer. So if a star has E(B-V)=0.6, that means it's reddened, and its apparent magnitude in V is higher by Av=3.1*0.6=1.86. So the actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But wait, does that matter for detection?

Wait, no. The question gives the apparent V magnitude as 15.5, but that's after extinction (so it's the observed magnitude). So I think that's the magnitude that the spectrographs would see. Wait, but for the purpose of detection, the observed apparent magnitude is what matters. So Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is within both ESPRESSO (<=17) and HIRES (<=16). So both could detect it. But wait, does extinction affect whether a star is detected? Well, I think for the purpose of this question, the apparent V magnitude given already accounts for extinction. Because the question says Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the intrinsic apparent mag would be lower, but the observed is higher. But wait, in reality, when a star's light is dimmed by dust, it's fainter, so its apparent magnitude increases (since lower brightness is higher magnitude). So if Star3 is at apparent mag 15.5, but that's after extinction, meaning without extinction, it's brighter. But for observation, the observed mag is 15.5, which is still within the limits of both spectrographs. So both can detect it.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If a star is at a certain distance, but with extinction, its apparent magnitude increases. So Star3's given apparent mag is 15.5, but without extinction, it would have been 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But for the spectrograph, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5. So for both spectrographs, Star3 is bright enough. Since 15.5 <17 and <16, so both can see it.

Star4: Absolute V mag is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent mag is 15.5. E(B-V)=0.4. So Av=3.1*0.4=1.24. So the apparent V mag is 15.5 +1.24 =16.74? Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Because the absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc without extinction. Then, when the star is at 10 pc but with extinction, the apparent magnitude would increase by Av. So if Star4's absolute mag is 15.5, which is its apparent mag without dust. But because there's extinction, the observed apparent mag is 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So Star4's observed V is 16.74.

Wait, but then for detection: ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is below that. HIRES can go up to 16. So 16.74 is higher than 16, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star4 is only seen by ESPRESSO.

But wait, wait, is the absolute magnitude the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, but without any extinction? So the actual apparent magnitude when considering extinction would be brighter or fainter? Let me think. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude if the star were at 10 pc, but without any interstellar extinction. So if the star is at 10 pc, and there's extinction, then the apparent mag increases (i.e., becomes fainter). So for Star4, absolute V is 15.5, so without extinction, it would have apparent V 15.5 at 10 pc. But with E(B-V)=0.4, which leads to Av=1.24, the apparent mag is 15.5 + 1.24 =16.74.

So Star4's observed apparent mag is 16.74. So HIRES's limit is 16, so it's beyond. So Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. Only ESPRESSO can detect it. So Star4 is not a candidate for both.

Star5: Absolute V is 16.5, located at 5 pc. So to find the apparent mag, I need to calculate it. Remember that apparent magnitude formula is m = M + 5 +5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs. So M=16.5, d=5.

So m =16.5 +5 +5*log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 +5*(log10(0.5)).

log10(0.5) is about -0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010) =-1.505.

So m=16.5+5-1.505 =20.995? Wait that can't be right. Wait, wait. Let me recheck the formula.

Wait, the formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5, I think. Because the formula is m - M =5 log10(d) -5, which comes from the distance modulus.

So for d=5 pc, log10(5)=0.69897. So 5 * 0.69897=3.49485. Then subtract 5: 3.49485-5= -1.50515.

So m = M + (5 log10(d) -5) =16.5 + (-1.50515) =14.99485, approximately 15.

Wait, that makes sense. Because a star at 5 pc with absolute mag 16.5 would have apparent mag around 15. So without extinction, Star5's apparent V mag is about 15.

But wait, the question doesn't mention any extinction for Star5. So E(B-V)=0? So Av=0. So apparent mag is 15. So both spectrographs can detect it, because 15 <16 and <17.

Wait, but I need to confirm. Star5's absolute mag is 16.5, at 5 pc. So m =16.5 +5*(log10(5) -1) =16.5 +5*(0.69897-1)=16.5 +5*(-0.30103)=16.5 -1.505≈15. So yeah, apparent mag is 15, which is within both ESPRESSO and HIRES limits.

So which stars can be detected by both? Let's list:

Star1: m=15.5 → ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect (15.5≤16? Yes. 15.5≤17, yes.)

Star2: m=16.5 → ESPRESSO can (<=17), HIRES can't.

Star3: m=15.5 → Both can.

Star4: m=16.74 → HIRES no, ESPRESSO yes.

Star5: m=15 → Both can.

Wait, so which stars can both detect?

Looking back:

Star1: can both detect.

Star3: can both detect.

Star5: can both detect.

Wait, so the options given are:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't, so A is wrong.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both can. So B is possible.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't, C is wrong.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't, so D is wrong.

Wait, but looking back at Star3. Wait, I thought Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is within both. But wait, earlier, I thought that Star3's given apparent mag is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6, which implies extinction. So the extinction makes the star appear dimmer. So the observed V magnitude is 15.5, which is after extinction. So I think that's correct.

So Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is acceptable for both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But let me check the options. The options are A to D, each with two stars.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 can, Star4 can't.

So the correct answer should be B, but I need to make sure.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, so not detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both are within limits.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m=16.5, not detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 not detected.

So the correct answer is either B or perhaps I made a mistake with another star.

Wait, no, Star1's m is 15.5. HIRES can handle up to 16. So 15.5 is within both.

So Star1 can be detected by both.

Wait, but the options don't have any option that includes Star1 and Star3 or Star5.

Looking again, the options:

A) 4 and 5 → no.

B) 3 and 5 → yes.

C) 2 and3 → no.

D) 1 and4 → no.

So the correct pairs are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But the options only have B as 3 and5. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but wait, Star5's m is 15, which is within both.

Star1's m is 15.5, which is within both.

So why isn't Star1 in any option? The options don't have an option that includes Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of them.

Wait, looking again at Star5.

Star5: absolute V is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m= M +5 log10(d/10) = 16.5 +5*(log10(5/10))=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, which rounds to 15. So apparent mag 15. So both can detect.

Star1: V=15.5, both can detect.

Star3: V=15.5, both can detect.

So according to the options, none of the options include 1,3,5. So perhaps I made a mistake in another star.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Star3's apparent magnitude. Star3's given apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6, which would mean that the observed V is 15.5 +1.86=17.36? No, I'm getting myself confused again.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The star's intrinsic apparent magnitude (if there's no extinction) is lower, because extinction makes it appear dimmer (higher mag). So when E(B-V)=0.6, the extinction adds to the apparent magnitude.

But in the question, Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. So that's already the observed magnitude, which includes the extinction. So for the purpose of detection, the apparent mag is 15.5, which is acceptable for both. So Star3 can be detected by both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (m=15.5), Star3 (m=15.5), and Star5 (m=15).

So in the options, which pairs are there?

Only option B (Star3 and Star5) and option D (Star1 and Star4). But Star4 isn't detected by HIRES.

Wait, so another possibility: perhaps Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but what about their declinations.

Wait, but the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitudes, so declination shouldn't matter.

Wait, but the RA and DEC for Star1 is RA 15 deg, DEC -75. Paranal is in the southern hemisphere (Chile) and Keck is in the northern hemisphere (Hawaii). So Star1 is at DEC -75, which is far south. Keck is at Mauna Kea, which is at latitude 19°N. So a star at DEC -75 would be visible from Paranal (latitude 24.6° S) but perhaps not from Keck, because it's too far south. Oh wait, the question says to disregard the pointing limits, so I shouldn't consider that. So regardless of DEC, both can observe it.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. According to the problem statement, I should disregard pointing limits, so DEC isn't a factor.

So, the problem is about apparent magnitude. So the only stars that can be detected by both are those with apparent V mag ≤16.

So the stars that meet this are:

Star1: 15.5 ≤16 → yes.

Star3:15.5 → yes.

Star5:15 → yes.

So the options are:

Looking again, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 cannot.

B) Star3 and Star5 → yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 is 16.5, can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the only correct pair is Star3 and Star5, which is option B.

Wait, but why isn't Star1 included in any option? Because the options don't have any option that includes Star1, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about Star5. Let me recheck.

Star5: absolute V is 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Using the distance modulus: m - M =5 log10(d) -5.

d=5 pc → log10(5)=0.69897.

So m -16.5=5*(0.69897) -5 → 3.49485 -5 = -1.50515.

So m=16.5 -1.50515=14.99485 → about 15.0.

So Star5's m is 15.0, which is within both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), and Star5 (15).

But the options only have pairs. So the only pair that fits is B: 3 and5.

So the answer should be B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17 mag, while HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 mag to be detectable by both instruments. Below is the analysis for each star:

### Star1
- Absolute V magnitude: 15.5 mag  
- Distance: 10 pc  
- Apparent V magnitude: Since absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is 15.5 mag.  
- Detection: 15.5 mag ≤ 16 mag (HIRES limit) and 15.5 mag ≤ 17 mag (ESPRESSO limit).  
- **Both spectrographs can detect Star1.**

### Star2
- Apparent V magnitude: 16.5 mag  
- Detection: 16.5 mag > 16 mag (HIRES limit).  
- **Only ESPRESSO can detect Star2.**

### Star3
- Apparent V magnitude: 15.5 mag  
- Extinction: E(B-V) = 0.6 mag  
- Extinction in V band: Av = 3.1 × E(B-V) = 1.86 mag  
- Observed apparent magnitude: The given apparent magnitude (15.5 mag) already accounts for extinction.  
- Detection: 15.5 mag ≤ 16 mag (HIRES limit) and 15.5 mag ≤ 17 mag (ESPRESSO limit).  
- **Both spectrographs can detect Star3.**

### Star4
- Absolute V magnitude: 15.5 mag  
- Distance: 10 pc  
- Apparent V magnitude: 15.5 mag (intrinsic at 10 pc).  
- Extinction: E(B-V) = 0.4 mag  
- Extinction in V band: Av = 3.1 × E(B-V) = 1.24 mag  
- Observed apparent magnitude: 15.5 mag + 1.24 mag = 16.74 mag.  
- Detection: 16.74 mag > 16 mag (HIRES limit).  
- **Only ESPRESSO can detect Star4.**

### Star5
- Absolute V magnitude: 16.5 mag  
- Distance: 5 pc  
- Apparent V magnitude: Using the distance modulus, \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 \):  
  \( m = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5(0.69897) - 5 = 15.0 \, \text{mag} \).  
- Extinction: No extinction mentioned (E(B-V) = 0).  
- Detection: 15.0 mag ≤ 16 mag (HIRES limit) and 15.0 mag ≤ 17 mag (ESPRESSO limit).  
- **Both spectrographs can detect Star5.**

### Conclusion
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1 (15.5 mag)**, **Star3 (15.5 mag)**, and **Star5 (15.0 mag)**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** satisfy the criteria.

**Answer: B**
