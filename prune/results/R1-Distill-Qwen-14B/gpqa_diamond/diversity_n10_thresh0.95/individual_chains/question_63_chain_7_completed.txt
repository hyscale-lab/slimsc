--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state and what photon momentum is needed for it to move to the next lowest energy state. The options are all different momentum values, so I need to find which one is correct.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can have rotational and vibrational energy states. The problem mentions the rotation-vibration model, which probably means we're considering both rotation and vibration. Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor model—so maybe the bond isn't perfectly rigid, but for this problem, maybe the key is about the energy levels.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state. So the next state would be the first excited state.

Wait, but in vibrational and rotational systems, the energy levels are quantized. For rotation, it's quantized as levels with different J values, and for vibration as different n values. Oh right, but I might be mixing up some details here.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I need to find the transition where the molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the next higher energy state with the least possible energy increase. So probably the smallest possible energy difference ΔE between two states.

Wait, the problem statement says, when the molecule is in its fundamental state. So what is the fundamental state in this context? For rotation, the ground state is J=0, and for vibration, the ground state is n=0. So the fundamental state is the lowest rotational and vibrational state, which is J=0, n=0.

But when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to the next possible energy state. The next state could involve either a change in rotation or vibration. Which transition would require the least energy? Because the photon's momentum is related to the energy change.

Wait, but I think the problem is specifically about the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. But when the molecule is in its fundamental state, I think that's the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be either n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational).

But which transition would be lower in energy? Because in quantum mechanics, the energy levels have different spacing. For vibrations, the energy levels are quantized with spacing of ħω (hbar times angular frequency). For rotation, the energy levels are quantized as (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So to find the next state with the lowest possible energy, we need the minimal ΔE. So we should compare the energy needed for the next vibrational state (n=1) and the next rotational state (J=1).

Wait, but for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy is usually higher than rotational. Because the spacing between rotational states is smaller. Let me think: the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I), and vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħ ω. So if ω is 4e14 rad/s, let's compute the energy for n=1 and J=1.

Wait, but the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be either the first vibrational excited state (n=1) or the first rotational excited state (J=1). Which of these requires less energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can make a transition that changes both J and n. But the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the minimal energy difference.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a transition where the molecule goes to the next state, which could be a combination of a change in J and n. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the progression from the ground state to the next state, which might involve a vibrational transition, but maybe that's not the case.

Wait, wait, the problem says, "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the smallest energy jump. So if the vibrational transition (n=0→n=1) has a higher energy than the rotational (J=0→J=1), then the photon would need to have the energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

But wait, let me compute the energies.

First, compute the rotational energy change from J=0 to J=1.

E_rot = [ (ħ² J (J+1) )/(2I) ].

At J=0, E_rot is 0. At J=1, it's (ħ² * 2)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Calculating the energy difference ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = ħ²/(I).

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

μ is (mass_X * mass_Y)/(mass_X + mass_Y). Oh, but wait, the masses are given in amu. So I need to convert them into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg.

Mass X is 20 amu: 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

Mass Y is 2 amu: 3.32e-27 kg (wait, 2 *1.66e-27 is 3.32e-27 kg, not 3.32e-26. Wait, no, 20 amu is 20 *1.66e-27 is 3.32e-26. Y is 2 amu: 3.32e-27 kg.)

So the reduced mass μ is (20 * 2) / (20 +2) ) amu. So (40)/(22) ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait no, wait, μ is (mass_X * mass_Y)/(mass_X + mass_Y) in kg. So let me compute that numerically.

mass_X = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

mass_Y = 2 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 )

Let me compute denominator first: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 +0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg.

Numerator: (3.32e-26) * (3.32e-27) = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53. 3.32^2 is about 11.0, so 1.1e-52 kg^2.

So μ = (1.1e-52) / (3.652e-26) ) ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

3.32 *3.32 is 11.0224, so 11.0224e-53 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 +0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = 11.0224e-53 / 3.652e-26 = (11.0224 / 3.652 ) * 1e-27.

11.0224 /3.652 ≈ 3.018.

So μ ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 12.072e-47 kg m². So I ≈1.2072e-46 kg m².

Wait, 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 is 12.072e-47 which is 1.2072e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that division: 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 = (1.112/1.2072) ) * 1e-22.

1.112 /1.2072 ≈ 0.921, so 0.921e-22 J ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Now, what about the vibrational energy change? The vibrational energy levels are (n + 1/2) ħ ω. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is ΔE_vib = ħ ω.

Given ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = ħ * 4e14 = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈ 4.2183e-20 J.

Comparing the two energy changes:

ΔE_rot ≈ 9.21e-23 J

ΔE_vib ≈ 4.2183e-20 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon would have to provide the energy for the rotational transition, as it's lower than the vibrational one.

Wait, but wait a second—is the molecule allowed to transition from J=0 to J=1 without any vibrational change? Because in the rigid rotor model, transitions between rotational states usually require dipole moment changes, but maybe that's beyond the scope here.

But the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which suggests that both are being considered. So perhaps the minimal energy is the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy should equal the rotational energy difference, which is 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the question asks for the momentum of the photon, not the energy. Oh right, because E_photon = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light.

So E = pc → p = E / c.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, wait, that's 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Let me compute that accurately.

9.21e-23 / 3e8 = (9.21 /3) *1e-31 = 3.07 *1e-31 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are around 1e-31. Let me look at the options:

Options are A) 1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, none of these are around 3e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I got this wrong. Maybe the molecule can't make a pure rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. Because in the rigid rotor model, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, but for a diatomic, changes in J are allowed, but perhaps for a photon to be absorbed, the molecule must have a dipole moment, which allows such transitions.

Wait, but perhaps the problem's model includes both rotation and vibration, so the transition is a combination. Hmm, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both J and n change. For example, from (J=0, n=0) to (J=1, n=0), which is pure rotation, or (J=0, n=1), which is pure vibration. Since the pure rotation requires less energy, that's the minimal. So my initial calculation should be correct.

But the issue is that the options don't match the p I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference.

Wait, let me double-check the moment of inertia. I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass: (mass_X * mass_Y)/(mass_X + mass_Y).

Mass_X =20 amu =20 *1.66e-27 kg=3.32e-26 kg.

Mass_Y =2 amu =3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 )

Wait, denominator: 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg.

Numerator: (3.32e-26 kg) * (3.32e-27 kg) = 11.022e-53 kg².

So μ = 11.022e-53 / 3.652e-26 = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 =12.07e-47 kg m² =1.207e-46 kg m².

Then, ΔE_rot = ħ²/(2I) * [1/(J=0) → J=1]. Wait, wait, the formula for E_rot is:

E_rot(J) = (ħ² J (J+1) )/(2I)

So E_rot(0) =0, E_rot(1) = (ħ² *2)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.207e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68.

So 1.1e-68 /1.207e-46 ≈ 9.1e-23 J.

Wait, same as before. So p=9.1e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈3.03e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are of the order 1e-28, 1e-27, which are about 10^4 times larger than what I got. So maybe I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the change is not just a rotational transition, but also the vibrational state. Because the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the next state after (J=0, n=0) is (J=1, n=0), which is a rotational transition. But if that's the case, then the energy change is as calculated, but that gives a p that's not in the options.

Alternatively, is the molecule allowed to transition to a higher vibrational state without changing rotational state? Because that would require more energy, but perhaps the minimal energy transition is from (J=0,n=0) to (J=0,n=1), which would be a vibrational transition.

Wait, let's recalculate the energy for the vibrational transition.

ΔE_vib = (n=1) - (n=0) = 1 * ħ ω.

So ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So p = 4.218e-20 J /3e8 m/s ≈ 1.406e-29 kg m/s ≈1.4e-29 Ns.

But that's even smaller than the 3e-31 I had earlier, and still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule moving to the next higher energy state, which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes. But that would probably require even higher energy, so that's not the minimal.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the model. Wait, perhaps the fundamental state isn't the lowest vibrational state but the lowest rotational state. Or perhaps the model is considering the energy levels as a combination of both, and the next state is the lowest in the combined energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the energy transition not from J=0→J=1 but from J=0→J=2, which would have a higher energy, but that would not be the minimal.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule in the ground vibrational state but the lowest rotational state, and when it absorbs a photon, it can move to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which of these requires the least energy?

As computed, the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

But again, I'm getting p around 3e-31, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia.

Wait, let me try that again.

Mass X is 20 amu: 20 *1.66e-27 = 3.32e-26 kg.

Mass Y is 2 amu: 2 *1.66e-27 =3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 )

Denominator:3.32e-26 +0.332e-26 =3.652e-26 kg.

Numerator: (3.32e-26)*(3.32e-27) = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 =11.02e-53 kg².

So μ =11.02e-53 /3.652e-26 = (11.02 /3.652) *1e-27 ≈ 3.018 *1e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I=μ r² =3.018e-27 kg * (4e-20 m²) =12.07e-47 kg m²=1.207e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

So E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 /1.207e-46.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1e-34)^2=1e-68, but more accurately, (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 *1e-68 = approx 1.112e-68.

So 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

So p=9.21e-23 /3e8 ≈3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps the model being considered is different. Maybe the question is about a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator, but perhaps the molecule is treated as a rigid rotor where the bond length isn't changing during rotation, but for the vibration, it's a harmonic oscillator.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the energy levels as a combination of rotation and vibration. But perhaps the next state is a vibrational transition but within the same rotational state. Because that would be the first possible state after the fundamental.

But that would require energy E_vib = ħ ω.

Which gives p = (4.218e-20 J)/(3e8 m/s) ≈1.406e-29 kg m/s, which is 1.4e-29 Ns. Again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the molecule as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator, but the next state after the fundamental is a rotational state with J=1. So the photon's energy is the rotational energy's change.

But that's what I did before, and it doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy formula. Rotational energy is sometimes given as E_rot = (J(J+1) ħ²)/(2I). So the change from J=0 to J=1 is (2 ħ²)/(2I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Yes, that's what I did. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions from the ground state to the first excited state, which is a rotational state. But the photon's momentum would be p = E/c, where E is the energy difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the classical model, treating the molecule as a point mass undergoing rotation, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the total energy difference, which includes both rotational and vibrational contributions. But I don't think that's the case because one is much smaller than the other.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the minimal energy but about the transition to the next state regardless of energy. But the question states "the next state with the lowest possible energy", which would imply the minimal ΔE.

Hmm, given that I'm not matching any of the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies, but no, the molecule is in the fundamental state (lowest possible), so the next state would be either higher rotation or higher vibration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the Raman transition, which allows for simultaneous changes in J and n, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the molecule as a pure rigid rotor, not considering vibrations, but that's probably not the case because the question mentions the rotation-vibration model.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to n=1, J=0, which is an allowed vibrational transition. So the energy would be ΔE = ħ ω.

Which gives p= ħ ω /c.

Let me compute that.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

ω=4e14 rad/s.

So E= ħ ω =1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

p=E/c=4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s =1.406e-28 N s.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N s. That's close.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition would have a lower energy. But why would the problem then require a photon momentum of 1.4e-28.

Wait, so let me recap.

If the molecule is in the (n=0, J=0) state, the next possible states are (n=1, J=0), which would be a vibrational transition, or (n=0, J=1), a rotational transition.

The energy difference for the rotational transition is about 9.21e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 Ns.

The vibrational transition gives p=1.4e-28 Ns.

But the vibrational transition requires higher energy, so why would the photon need to have higher energy? The question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the smaller ΔE, which is the rotational transition. But that's not matching the options.

Ah, wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator (vibrational) but neglecting rotational effects. So the minimal energy transition is the vibrational one, giving p=1.4e-28, which matches option D.

But why would that be the case? The question mentions the rotation-vibration model, so I thought both are considered. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only vibrational transitions because the rotational transitions are not allowed, or perhaps the question has a specific setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational transition's momentum.

Wait, let me recalculate the rotational p.

ΔE_rot =9.21e-23 J.

p =9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 N s.

Which is about 3e-31 Ns, but no options are that small.

But option D is about 1.4e-28, which is larger by a factor of about 4.6e4.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the moment of inertia. Let me recheck the calculation.

Mass X:20 amu=20 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.321e-26 kg.

Mass Y:2 amu=3.321e-27 kg.

μ= (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27)/(3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 )

Denominator:3.321e-26 +0.3321e-26 =3.6531e-26 kg.

Numerator:3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 *1e-53.

3.321^2≈11.028.

So numerator≈11.028e-53.

μ=11.028e-53 /3.6531e-26 ≈ (11.028/3.6531 ) *1e-27 ≈3.018e-27 kg.

So I=μ r²=3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =12.072e-47 kg m²=1.2072e-46 kg m².

So E_rot= ħ²/(I)= (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.2072e-46.

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2=1.112e-68.

So E_rot=1.112e-68 /1.2072e-46 ≈9.21e-23 J.

So p=9.21e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns.

But no option matches. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, which gives p=1.4e-28, which is option D.

But why would the question suggest that the next lowest energy state is a vibrational transition if the rotational one is lower in energy?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is already in the lowest vibrational state, but the next state is the first rotational state. But that would require the photon to have the rotational energy's momentum, which isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used treats the vibrational energy as the primary factor. Maybe the problem is treating the transition as a vibrational one, and the rotational part is neglected.

In that case, the photon's momentum would be 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But I'm not entirely confident because my initial calculation suggested the rotational transition requires less energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Raman effect, where both rotational and vibrational changes occur, but that's beyond the scope of the question.

Given the options, the only one that comes close to the vibrational transition is option D.

So I think the correct answer is D, 1.4e-28 N s.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for a diatomic molecule in its fundamental state to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Mass of X**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} = 3.32 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \)
2. **Mass of Y**: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} = 3.32 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
3. **Bond length**: \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
4. **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Step 1: Reduced Mass
The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{(3.32 \times 10^{-26}) \cdot (3.32 \times 10^{-27})}{3.32 \times 10^{-26} + 3.32 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]

### Step 2: Moment of Inertia
The moment of inertia \( I \) is:
\[
I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Rotational Energy Transition
The rotational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_{\text{rot}}(J) = \frac{\hbar^2 J (J+1)}{2I}.
\]
For \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \), the energy difference is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(1) - E_{\text{rot}}(0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
\]
Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Vibrational Energy Transition
The vibrational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_{\text{vib}}(n) = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega.
\]
For \( n = 0 \to n = 1 \), the energy difference is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 5: Comparison of Energy Differences
The rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), while the vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \). The rotational transition requires significantly less energy.

### Step 6: Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition
The momentum \( p \) of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
\]
This value is much smaller than any of the provided options.

### Step 7: Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition
For the vibrational transition:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]
This matches closely with **Option D** (\( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).

### Conclusion
Although the rotational transition requires less energy, the provided options suggest that the problem is focusing on the vibrational transition. Therefore, the correct answer is:
