Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're told that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which probably means I can use the Boltzmann equation here. Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, E is the energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Oh wait, in this case, the problem mentions that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me note that as delta E.

So, the ratio of the populations (n1/n2) is given as 2 for star_1 compared to star_2? Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh wait, wait, what does "twice as excited" mean? Does it mean the population in the higher energy level is twice as much? Or is it the ratio between the two stars?

Wait, the question states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, in star_1, the number of excited atoms in that specific level is twice that in star_2. So, n1 (for star_1) is 2 times n2 (for star_2). Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, perhaps I should model this for each star. Let me think, for star_1, the population in energy level j is n1. For star_2, it's n2. According to the problem, n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, no, because the stars might have different temperatures. So each star's population is determined by their own temperature. So for each star, the population ratio is determined by their own T.

Wait, more accurately, for each star, the population ratio between two energy levels (let's say level i and level j, where j is higher) is given by (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). But wait, in this problem, it's about the same energy levels in each star. So the same transition, same energy difference.

Wait, maybe I should consider the ratio between the two stars. Let me think. For each star, the population ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - delta E/(k T) ), where delta E is the energy difference between the two levels.

In star_1, the ratio is (n_i^1)/(n_j^1) = exp( - delta E/(k T1) ), and in star_2, it's (n_i^2)/(n_j^2) = exp( - delta E/(k T2) ).

But the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. What's being compared? The excitation of a specific energy level. Let me re-read the question.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, perhaps the number of atoms in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 than star_2. So n1 (excited) is 2 * n2 (excited) for the same level. Or maybe the excitation is the ratio of the excited level to the ground level? I think that's more likely. Because in Boltzmann, the ratio is between
