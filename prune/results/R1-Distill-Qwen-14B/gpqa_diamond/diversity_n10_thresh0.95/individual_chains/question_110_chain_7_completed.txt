Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm a bit new to this.

First, I remember that both these instruments are high-resolution spectrographs. ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, and HIRES is at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The question is about which stars are observable by both, so I need to figure out the apparent magnitudes each star has and see if they fall within the detectable range of both instruments.

The problem gives me the parameters for each star. Let's list them out.

Star1:
- Absolute magnitude (Mv) = 15.5 mag
- Distance = 10 pc
- RA and DEC are given, but I think distance is enough to calculate apparent magnitude.

Star2:
- Apparent magnitude (mv) = 16.5 mag
- Distance is 5 pc, but since mv is given, maybe I don't need to calculate it.

Star3:
- mv = 15.5 mag, but E(B-V) = 0.6. There's also a note about extinction in the V band. So I think I need to calculate the extinction to get the true apparent magnitude.

Star4:
- Mv = 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4, distance = 10 pc.

Star5:
- Mv =16.5 mag, distance=5 pc.

Wait, so the key here is apparent V magnitude because that's what the instruments can detect. Each spectrograph has a limit: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 mag, which I think means anything with mv <=17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V=16, so mv <=16.

Wait, no, wait. The question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Wait, I'm a bit confused. In astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter. So if a star has V magnitude of 17, it's at the limit. So if a spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 17, that means it can see stars with mv less than or equal to 17. Because higher magnitude numbers are dimmer. So for ESPRESSO, stars with mv <=17 can be observed. For HIRES, stars with mv <=16 can be observed because it's brighter than 16. So to be detectable by both, the star's apparent magnitude must be <=16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can go up to 17.

Wait, no: the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, that's a bit tricky. Because 'brighter than 17' would mean mv <17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter.

So ESPRESSO can detect stars brighter than 17, so mv <17.

HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 mag, so mv <16.

Wait, that's not correct. Because if a star is 17 magnitude, it's dimmer than a 16 mag star. So if HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, that means mv <16. So any star with mv <=16 can be seen by HIRES, but anything brighter than 17 (so up to 17 mag) can be seen by ESPRESSO. Wait no, because 'brighter than 17' would mean stars with mv less than 17. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the maximum magnitude each can detect.

Wait, the wording is: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star is brighter (i.e., lower magnitude) than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. So the limit is 17. So any star with mv <17 can be observed.

HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16, so any star with mv <16.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if a star is brighter than 17, it's within ESPRESSO's range. So the maximum for ESPRESSO is 17. For HIRES, the maximum is 16. So for a star to be detectable by both, it must have mv <=16, because if it's 17, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the maximum magnitude each can detect. For example, if a star's magnitude is 17, ESPRESSO can detect it, but HIRES cannot since 17 >16. So the star must have mv <=16 to be detectable by both.

Wait, but for Star2, the given is apparent V magnitude 16.5. So for HIRES, that's over 16, so it can't be observed. So Star2 is not observable by HIRES. So Star2 can only be observed by ESPRESSO.

So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust) if applicable, and see which ones are <=16.

Let's go through each star.

Star1:
- Mv =15.5, Distance =10 pc.

The formula for apparent magnitude is:
mv = Mv + 5 log10(d) - 5

So d is 10 pc. log10(10) is 1.

So mv =15.5 +5*(1) -5 =15.5 +5-5=15.5. So mv is 15.5.

So Star1's mv is 15.5, which is less than 16. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it because 15.5 <16 and 15.5 <17.

Wait, but wait: Star1's parameters are:

- Absolute V magnitude (Mv):15.5 mag.

- Distance: 10 pc.

So mv = Mv +5 log10(d/10) → since d is in parsecs.

So 10 pc → log10(10/10)=0. So mv =15.5 +0 =15.5.

So yes, 15.5. So both spectrographs can see it.

Star2:

- mv =16.5, which is given. So for HIRES, the limit is 16, so any star with mv <=16 can be observed. 16.5 is over, so HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can because mv=16.5 <17. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Star3:

- mv=15.5 mag, but with E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, I think E(B-V) is the color excess, which indicates interstellar reddening. The formula given is that the total absorption in V band (Av) is 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag.

So apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5. But since extinction makes the star appear dimmer, we have to add Av to the apparent magnitude.

Wait, no: wait, extinction causes the star to appear dimmer, so the observed apparent magnitude (mv_observed) is brighter (lower) than the intrinsic. Wait, no, wait—no, that's not right. Extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so the observed mv is higher (more positive) than the intrinsic.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think. The total absorption Av is the amount by which the apparent magnitude increases due to extinction. Because the star's light is absorbed, making it dimmer, so the apparent magnitude is higher.

So the formula is mv_observed = mv_intrinsic + Av.

Wait, but Star3's given mv is 15.5, which is the observed mv, or the intrinsic? Wait, the problem says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because E(B-V) is the difference between the observed B-V and the intrinsic B-V. So if a star's light is reddened by dust, its apparent magnitude in V would be dimmer (higher mv) than the intrinsic.

So the given mv is the observed apparent magnitude, which includes extinction. But wait, no, the problem says Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5. But E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the given mv is the intrinsic, and with extinction, the observed mv would be higher. Or maybe the given mv already accounts for extinction.

Wait, in the problem, Star3's data is:

apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag, located at 15 pc.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the intrinsic apparent magnitude and then add the extinction to find the observed mv.

Wait, no. Because the given mv is the apparent magnitude as observed, which includes extinction. Then, the E(B-V) is the color excess, which is E(B-V) = (B-V)_observed - (B-V)_intrinsic. But we don't need B-V here. The problem gives that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So to find the extinction in V, Av = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 *0.6 =1.86 mag.

Wait, but wait: the problem says "the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient of 3.1." So Av = 3.1 * E(B-V).

So if the star's intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude is mv0, then the observed mv is mv0 + Av.

Wait, but Star3's given mv is 15.5, which is the observed magnitude. So the intrinsic mv (without extinction) would be mv_intrinsic = mv_observed - Av.

Wait, no, because extinction causes the star to appear dimmer, so the observed mv is higher. So mv_observed = mv_intrinsic + Av.

So, for Star3, the observed mv is 15.5, but that includes extinction. But wait, the problem says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So does that mean that is the observed mv, which includes extinction? Or is that the intrinsic?

Hmm, the problem says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V..."

Wait, so the given mv is the apparent one, which already includes extinction. Because the 'apparent' magnitude is what we observe, which is affected by interstellar extinction (dust). So if that's the case, then Star3's apparent mv is 15.5, but the question is, is that the observed or the intrinsic?

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because the apparent magnitude is the observed. So if the star's light is extinguished, its observed apparent magnitude is higher. So perhaps Star3's given mv is the observed one, and the E(B-V) is the color excess. But the question is, does the given mv already include the extinction? Or is the given mv the intrinsic, and we need to add the extinction to get the observed mv?

The problem says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The point is, when considering whether a star is visible, we need to use the apparent magnitude as observed, which includes extinction.

Wait, no. Because if a star is dimmer due to extinction, it's harder to see with the spectrograph. So actually, the observed apparent magnitude is higher (dimmer) than the intrinsic. So to see if a star is detectable, we need to calculate the observed mv, including extinction.

Wait, the confusion here is whether the given mv is already the observed or the intrinsic. Let's read the question again.

Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6.

So the given mv is the apparent, which includes E(B-V). So the observed mv is 15.5. So Av = 3.1 * 0.6 =1.86. But that's the extinction, which would make the star dimmer, so the observed mv is higher than the intrinsic.

Wait, but in this case, the given mv is the observed. So perhaps the calculation is that Star3 has an observed mv of 15.5, which is less than 16, so detectable by both. Because 15.5 <16, so HIRES can see it, and 15.5 <17, so ESPRESSO can see it.

Wait, but that can't be right, because if the star is at 15 pc, the apparent magnitude would be further away, but in this case, it's given as 15.5, which is the observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the given mv is the intrinsic, and we need to add the extinction to get the observed.

Wait, that would make more sense. Because the problem gives for Star3: apparent V magnitude 15.5, but that's after extinction. Or is it before?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude m0, and it's at a certain distance, but with extinction, the observed m is m0 + Av.

So if the problem says the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that's the observed (after extinction), then that's the number we use. But if it's the intrinsic (without extinction), then we have to add Av to get the observed.

But the problem seems to say that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which would already include extinction (since we observe it as dimmer). So I think the given mv is the observed, so we don't need to adjust it further.

Alternatively, perhaps the given mv is the absolute magnitude. No, the problem says it's the apparent magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given mv is the apparent (observed) magnitude, which already includes extinction. So the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is what the instrument would see.

So for Star3, mv=15.5, which is less than 16. So both can detect it.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me proceed with each star, calculating their apparent magnitude, considering any extinction.

Star4:

- Mv=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance=10 pc.

So first, compute the apparent magnitude without extinction.

mv_intrinsic = Mv +5 log10(d/10) → d=10 → log(1)=1 → mv=15.5 +5*1 -5=15.5.

But wait, no. Wait, the formula is mv = Mv +5 log10(d) -5. Because Mv is the absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So for d in parsecs, it's mv = Mv +5 log10(d) -5.

Wait, for d=10 pc, log10(10)=1, so 5*1=5, 5-5=0 → mv =15.5 +0=15.5.

But this is without extinction. Now, considering extinction, the observed mv would be mv_observed = mv_intrinsic + Av.

Av=3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So mv_observed =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed apparent magnitude is about 16.74. Which is higher than 16.

So for HIRES, which can only go up to 16, this star would be too dim (since 16.74>16). So HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can since 16.74 <17.

So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

Star5:

- Mv=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Compute mv without extinction.

mv_intrinsic = Mv +5 log10(d/10) → d=5, so log10(5/10)= log10(0.5)= -0.3010.

So mv =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) → 16.5 -1.505 =14.995 ≈15.0.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate:

mv = Mv +5 log10(d) -5

d=5 pc.

So log10(5) is approximately 0.69897.

So mv =16.5 +5*(0.69897) -5.

5*0.69897 is ~3.49485.

So 16.5 +3.49485 =19.99485. Then subtract 5 →14.99485. So about 15.0.

So mv_intrinsic is 15.0. But wait, any extinction in Star5? Let's check the problem statement.

Star5's data: absolute V magnitude of 16.5, distance 5 pc. There's no mention of E(B-V), so I think we can assume Av=0 (no extinction). So mv_observed =15.0.

So Star5's observed apparent magnitude is 15.0, which is less than 16. So both spectrographs can see it.

Wait, but wait. Star5's Mv is 16.5, which is higher than Star1's Mv of 15.5. But distance is only 5 pc, so maybe the apparent magnitude is brighter. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate Star5's mv.

mv = Mv +5 log10(d) -5

d=5 pc.

5 log10(5) =5 * 0.69897 ≈3.49485.

So 16.5 +3.49485 =19.99485. Minus 5: 14.99485 → ~15.0.

Yes, so mv is 15.0. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it.

Wait, but in the options, I need to see which stars are detectable by both.

So let's list each star's observable status.

Star1: mv=15.5 → yes for both.

Star2: mv=16.5 → can't be seen by HIRES (needs mv <16), but can be seen by ESPRESSO.

Star3: mv=15.5, but wait, I thought earlier that the given mv was the observed, so mv=15.5. So yes, both can see it.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's given mv is 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6, so Av=1.86. But if the given mv is the observed, then the intrinsic mv would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's irrelevant because the observed mv is what matters for detection.

Wait, no. The observed mv is 15.5, which is already after extinction. So for detection, we compare the observed mv.

So Star3: observed mv=15.5 → both can see it.

Star4: observed mv=16.74 → HIRES can't, but ESPRESSO can.

Star5: observed mv=15.0 → both can see it.

So which stars are detectable by both?

Star1: yes.
Star3: yes.
Star5: yes.

Wait, but the options don't include all three. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be seen by both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both have mv <=16, so yes.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2's mv=16.5, so can't see with HIRES.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

So the stars that can be seen by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but I thought Star1's mv is 15.5, which is less than 16, so both can see it. So in the options, the possible pairs would be Star1 and Star3, or Star3 and Star5, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5.

Option D is Star1 and Star4.

But wait, in the option B, both are detectable by both instruments.

So according to this, the correct answer would include Star3 and Star5.

But wait, earlier I thought Star3's mv is 15.5, which is okay, but what about Star5? Star5's mv is 15.0, which is also okay.

So the possible pairs are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), Star5 (15.0).

Looking at the options, Option B is Star3 and Star5. So both can be seen by both spectrographs.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check Star3's parameters.

Wait, Star3's given parameters are:

- RA =11h, DEC=48deg, apparent V magnitude 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance=15 pc.

Wait, but to compute the intrinsic apparent magnitude, we'd have to calculate it without extinction. Because if the given mv is apparent (which includes extinction), then observed mv=15.5. But if the given mv is the intrinsic, then the observed mv would be 15.5 +1.86 = 17.36, which is over ESPRESSO's limit (since 17.36>17). So in that case, only ESPRESSO can see it if at all.

Wait, now I'm getting confused again. The problem statement for Star3 says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag..."

So the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed, meaning it's already been affected by extinction. So we don't need to adjust it.

Wait, but wait. The apparent V magnitude is the observed, which is already dimmer (higher mv) due to extinction. So Star3's observed mv is 15.5, which is within both instruments' limits.

So let's recast:

Star3: observed mv=15.5 → both can see it.

Star5: observed mv=15.0 → both can see it.

So the correct answer would be the option that includes these two.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both instruments.

So the answer should be B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m_v < 17$), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m_v < 16$). Therefore, a star must have $m_v < 16$ to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M_v = 15.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 10$ pc  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - $m_v = 15.5$, which is less than 16.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

2. **Star2**  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m_v = 16.5$  
   - $m_v = 16.5$ is greater than 16.  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.**

3. **Star3**  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m_v = 15.5$  
   - Color excess: $E(B-V) = 0.6$  
   - Total absorption in V band:  
     \[
     A_v = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - The given $m_v$ already includes extinction (observed magnitude), so no further adjustment is needed.  
   - $m_v = 15.5$, which is less than 16.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

4. **Star4**  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M_v = 15.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 10$ pc  
   - Apparent V magnitude (intrinsic):  
     \[
     m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Color excess: $E(B-V) = 0.4$  
   - Total absorption in V band:  
     \[
     A_v = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_v = m_v + A_v = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - $m_v = 16.74$, which is greater than 16.  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.**

5. **Star5**  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M_v = 16.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 5$ pc  
   - Apparent V magnitude (intrinsic):  
     \[
     m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5
     \]  
     \[
     \log_{10}(5) \approx 0.699 \quad \Rightarrow \quad m_v = 16.5 + 5(0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 15.0
     \]  
   - No extinction is mentioned, so $m_v = 15.0$.  
   - $m_v = 15.0$, which is less than 16.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

### Conclusion:
Stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, the correct pair is **Star3 and Star5**.

**Answer: B**
