Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (pl) is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a small parallax is far away, and a large parallax is nearby. But how does the number of stars per unit parallax change as parallax changes?

So the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, which I guess is like how many stars you find when you look at a slice of the sky for a certain change in parallax. Let's say you're looking at a range of plx from pl to pl + dpl, how many stars are in that range?

I think this has to do with the distribution of stars in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means there are the same number of stars in a given volume anywhere you look. Wait, but the volume in space as you go further out increases, right? Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so it scales with the cube of the radius.

So parallax is 1/distance. So if parallax increases, the distance decreases. Let me denote distance as d, so pl = 1/d. So for a given range of plx, say from pl to pl + dpl, I need to find how the number of stars N in that range depends on pl.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume depends on the volume. The volume per unit distance (or per unit d) increases with d. Wait, maybe I should think about the differential volume.

The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π d³, or wait, actually, the volume between d and d+dd is 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is surface area (4πd²) multiplied by thickness (dd).

So if I have a parallax range from pl to pl + dpl, which corresponds to distance from d to d + dd, where d = 1/pl and dd = 1/(pl + dpl) - 1/pl. Wait, maybe pl is small, so I can approximate pl as approximately 1/d, so when pl changes by dpl, the distance changes by dd. Let me think about the relationship between dpl and dd.

Wait, pl = 1/d, so d = 1/pl. So dd = - (1/pl²) dpl. Oh, because d = 1/pl, so dd = - dpl / pl². So dd is proportional to -dpl. But I'm dealing with magnitudes, so I can ignore the negative sign for now since I'm considering the absolute change.

So the number of stars in a parallax range dpl is the same as the number in a distance range dd, scaled by the volume.

Wait, but the number of stars is proportional to the volume. So for a given volume, the number of stars is N = n * Volume, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But how does this translate to parallax? Let's think in terms of distance. Let's say the number per unit distance is proportional to the volume element, which is 4π d² dd. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases with d squared.

But wait, the number of stars per unit distance (per dd) is proportional to d². Because Volume element is 4π d² dd. So n * 4π d² dd.

But I need the number per unit parallax, which is dpl. Because the question is about the number per unit plx range.

So dpl is the change in parallax. And since pl = 1/d, dpl = -1/d² dd. So dd = - dpl * d². Or, for small changes, dpl is approximately - (1/d²) dd. Wait, but I need to relate dd to dpl.

Alternatively, let me express the number of stars between parallax pl and pl + dpl as N = n * (Volume between d and d+dd).

But Volume between d and d + dd is 4π (d)^2 dd. So N = n * 4π d² dd.

But I need N in terms of dpl. So substituting dd in terms of dpl.

We have pl = 1/d, so d = 1/pl. Then dd = d (dpl)^2) ? Wait, no. Let me think again.

pl = 1/d → d = 1/pl. So dd/ddpl = derivative of d with respect to pl.

dd/ddpl = derivative of (1/pl) with respect to pl → -1/pl².

So dd = (-1/pl²) dpl. So, in terms of dpl, Volume becomes 4π (1/pl)^2 * (-dpl / pl²) )? Wait, wait. Let me do the substitution:

N = n * 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/pl → d² = 1/pl².

And dd = (-1/pl²) dpl → but since dpl is a small positive change, perhaps we can take absolute value, so |dd| = (1/pl²) dpl.

So N = n * 4π (1/pl^2) * (dpl / pl^2) ) → N = n * 4π (dpl) / pl^4.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check:

Volume between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. So yes. So substituting d = 1/pl, dd = (dpl * 1/(pl^2)).

Wait, no, because pl = 1/d → dpl = - (1/d^2) dd. So, rearranged, dd = - d^2 dpl.

Since d = 1/pl, dd = - (1/(pl^2)) dpl.

So substituting into N:

N = n * 4π (d^2) * (-d^2 dpl) → which is n *4π (1/(pl^2)) * (1/(pl^2)) dpl * (-1). But since we're considering positive dpl (because it's a range), the negative sign just indicates direction, so we can ignore it for the number.

So N = n * 4π (d^4) dpl.

But d is 1/pl, so d^4 is 1/(pl^4). So N = n *4π (1/(pl^4)) dpl.

Wait, but that suggests that the number of stars per unit plx (dpl) is inversely proportional to pl^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/(pl^4).

But wait, that can't be right because when pl is small (d is large), the number of stars should be less. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because when pl is small, d is large. So in a given plx range (like from pl to pl + dpl), which is a small change in pl, the corresponding distance is a small change in d (since pl is small). But the number of stars in that distance range depends on the volume element, which is proportional to d² dd. So as d increases, the volume element increases.

So for a given dpl, the corresponding dd is smaller when pl is small (d is large), so the N would be proportional to d² * dd.

Wait, let me think.

We have N = n * 4π d² dd.

We can express this as N = n *4π d^2 * (dd).

But dd = (dpl * (d^2)), because from pl = 1/d, dpl = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dpl.

Substituting into N:

N = n *4π d² * (d² dpl) → n *4π d^4 dpl.

But d = 1/pl → d^4 = 1/(pl^4).

So N = n *4π (1/(pl^4)) dpl.

Which means that N is proportional to 1/(pl^4) per unit dpl.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dpl) is inversely proportional to pl^4. So the number density (stars per unit plx) goes as 1/pl^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach might give a different result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. The number of stars in that shell is n *4π d² dd. Since n is uniform, the number is proportional to d² dd.

But parallax pl =1/d → d =1/pl. So substituting, number of stars N is proportional to (1/pl)^2 * (1/(pl^2)) dpl.

Wait, because dd = (1/(pl^2)) dpl. So N = (d^2) * dd * 4πn → (1/pl^2) * (1/pl^2) dpl) *4πn.

So N is proportional to (dpl) / pl^4.

Which again leads to 1/pl^4.

So the number per unit plx (dpl) is 1/pl^4. So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax, distance, and the distribution of stars in space.

1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**: Parallax (\( \text{pl} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{pl} = 1/d \). A small parallax corresponds to a large distance, while a large parallax corresponds to a small distance.

2. **Volume Element and Star Count**: The number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself, assuming a uniform distribution of stars. The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Thus, the number of stars in this shell is proportional to \( d^2 dd \).

3. **Expressing in Terms of Parallax**: Since \( d = 1/\text{pl} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( d\text{pl} \) (a small change in parallax). Differentiating \( d = 1/\text{pl} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{pl}^2} d\text{pl} \). Substituting \( d = 1/\text{pl} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{pl}^2} d\text{pl} \) into the volume element, the number of stars becomes proportional to:
   \[
   N \propto d^2 dd = \left(\frac{1}{\text{pl}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{pl}^2} d\text{pl}\right) \propto \frac{1}{\text{pl}^4} d\text{pl}.
   \]

4. **Interpreting the Result**: The number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{pl} \)) is inversely proportional to \( \text{pl}^4 \). This means as parallax decreases (distance increases), the number of stars per unit parallax range drops sharply.

5. **Option Analysis**: Among the given options:
   - **A) \( \sim 1/\text{pl}^4 \)**: Matches the derived result.
   - **B) \( \sim 1/\text{pl}^2 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger due to the volume element scaling with \( d^4 \).
   - **C) \( \sim 1/\text{pl}^1 \)**: Incorrect, as it underestimates the dependence.
   - **D) \( \sim 1/\text{pl}^3 \)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived result.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim 1/\text{pl}^4 \).
