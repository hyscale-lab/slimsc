Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of angular momentum operators. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, Ay. The setup says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices for spin-½ particles. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are involved in representing spin operators. The spin matrices Sx, Sy, Sz are proportional to the corresponding Pauli matrices. So maybe S here is the Pauli Y matrix?

Let me think. The Pauli Y matrix, σy, is indeed [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be σy. 

So the operator Ay is c times σy. Since c is h/(4π), let's write that out. So Ay = (h/4π) * σy. 

But wait, what are the eigenvalues of σy? I remember that the eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1 because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and their eigenvalues satisfy (σy)^2 = I, the identity matrix. So for σy, the eigenvalues are ±1. 

Thus, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by these, so c*(±1). Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a would be ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but let me double-check. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are indeed ±1. So when you multiply by a scalar, the eigenvalues just scale by that factor. So yes, Ay's eigenvalues should be ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real or imaginary? Wait, wait. Wait, σy is Hermitian, so Ay is also Hermitian because c is real. Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues should be real, not having any imaginary parts. 

So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts must be incorrect. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). So eigenvalues are complex? That can't be right because Ay is Hermitian. So option A is wrong. 

Option B: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Wait, but again, eigenvalues should be real, so this option is also incorrect. 

Hmm, looking back, wait. Did I make a mistake? Let me reevaluate. Because wait, Ay is c times σy. So if c is h/(4π), then the eigenvalues are c * (±1) = ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers. So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). 

Wait, another thought. Let me compute the matrix Ay explicitly. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Multiply by c = h/(4π). So Ay is:

[[0, -i * h/(4π)], [i * h/(4π), 0]]

So to find eigenvalues, I can set up the characteristic equation.

The matrix is 2x2, so the trace is 0 and determinant is (0)(0) - (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)).

Calculate the determinant: 

(−i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) )= (−i)(i) * (h/(4π))^2 = (1) * (h²)/(16 π²) = h²/(16 π²)

So the determinant is h²/(16 π²).

The eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - (trace)*λ + determinant = 0. Since trace is 0, equation is λ² + (h²/(16 π²)) )= 0 → λ² = - h²/(16 π²).

Wait wait, that would give λ = ± i h/(4π). Oh, wait a second. That's different from what I thought earlier. I think I made a mistake earlier. Because σy is Hermitian, so S is Hermitian? Let me check. The matrix S is:

0   -i
i    0

The conjugate transpose would be:

0    i
- i   0

Which is not the same as S. Wait, no. Wait, for a matrix to be Hermitian, it should equal its conjugate transpose. Let me compute S^†.

S^† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is not the same as S. Because the original S has [i,0] in the second row. So S is not Hermitian. Wait, but that can't be right because σy is Hermitian. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, in the problem statement, S is given as the first row (0, -i), second (i, 0). Let me write S as a matrix:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Then, S^† is the conjugate transpose. Since the elements are real except for the i's. So S^† would be [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ]

But the original S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So S^† is not equal to S. Therefore, S is not Hermitian. So that's conflicting with my earlier thought because σy is Hermitian. Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me write down σy again.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually given as:

σy = [ [0, -i],
        [i, 0] ]

Which is actually equal to its conjugate transpose. Let me compute S^† again. S^† would have the first row as [0, i], second row as [ -i, 0 ].

Wait, no, because the conjugate of -i is i, and i becomes -i. So S^† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is not the same as S. So S is not Hermitian. That's a problem because I thought σy is Hermitian. Wait, maybe I messed up. Let me think about σy again. Oh wait, perhaps S is actually -σy?

Because σy is Hermitian, and its matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as S in the problem. So S is σy, which is Hermitian. That would mean S is indeed Hermitian. Because when you take the conjugate transpose, you get the same matrix. Let me check: For S, the (1,2) element is -i. Its conjugate is i. In the transpose, the (2,1) element would be i. So the conjugate transpose would have (2,1) as i, which matches S's (2,1) element, which is i. Similarly, (1,2) element of S^† is i, which would be the (2,1) element of S. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, matrix S:

Row 1: [0, -i]
Row 2: [i, 0]

Transpose of S would be:

Column 1: [0, i]
Column 2: [-i, 0]

So the transpose is:

[ [0, i],
  [-i, 0] ]

Now, the conjugate of that would be:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Which is the original S. So S is equal to its conjugate transpose. So S is Hermitian. Therefore, σy is Hermitian, so Ay is c times a Hermitian matrix, so Ay is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues must be real.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to compute the eigenvalues, I thought I got imaginary numbers. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

The matrix Ay is c times S. So c is h/(4π), which is a real scalar.

So, the matrix Ay is:

[ [ c*0, c*(-i) ],
  [ c*i, c*0 ] ]

Which is:

[ [0, -i c ],
  [i c, 0 ] ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ      -i c |
| i c     -λ |

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (1)(c²) because (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is λ² - (c^2) → λ² - c² = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ± c → so eigenvalues are +c and -c.

So a = ±c → which is ±h/(4π).

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So the eigenvalues are real, which makes sense because Ay is Hermitian.

So looking back at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real, so this is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. No, same issue.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm.

Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum. Since for spin-½ particles, A² has eigenvalues (ħ(ħ + 1)) etc. Wait, but wait, the question is about the intrinsic angular momentum of the muon, which is spin-½. So the eigenvalues of A² should be (½(½ +1))ħ² → but wait, in our case, c is h/(4π), and the operator is Ay = c S.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the eigenfunctions. Since Ay and A² share the same eigenfunctions, because A² is the Casimir operator and commutes with all the components. So if a state is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's automatically an eigenfunction of A². So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. But what about Az? Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So a function can't be eigenfunction of both Ay and Az. So option C says it can be eigenfunction of A² but not of Az, which is correct. So option C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. The basis functions would be the eigenvectors of Ay, but the matrix operator's basis is perhaps the standard basis. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, so the matrix is represented in the standard basis (computational basis). So the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors when diagonalized, but the question is, are they the basis of the matrix operator? I'm not entirely sure. But if the matrix is diagonal in that basis, then yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis. But I'm not certain about this option. 

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So the options are about which statements are correct in the process.

So, looking again at the options, let's think:

Which statements are correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay?

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think this refers to the fact that the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the two eigenvectors (assuming they are distinct, which they are) will form a basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions are a basis for the matrix operator. So option D is correct.

But wait, let's reevaluate. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, which of these statements is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are the same. So this is correct. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors span the space and thus form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Which statements are correct during the calculation.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix operator is written in the standard basis. The eigenvectors are the functions that diagonalize it. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions in which the matrix is diagonal. But the original matrix is not diagonal, it's in the standard basis. So perhaps the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix operator, which is in the standard basis. Hmm. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, the statement says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That would be the case if the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, which they do. So option D is correct.

Wait, but let's think about the other options.

So the correct eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) as real numbers. So looking at the options, none of the options A or B have real eigenvalues. So only options C and D are possible.

Which one is correct?

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Because A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So yes, it's correct. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, so this is also correct. So both C and D are correct statements. But wait, looking at the options, can only one be correct? Or does the question state that only one is correct?

The question says which statement is correct, implying only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenfunctions are vectors in a two-dimensional space. So the eigenfunctions form a basis. So statement D is correct.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

So let's see the options again:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². But since Az doesn't commute with Ay, their eigenfunctions are different. So yes, C is correct.

Option D is correct as well.

Wait, but the options might have only one correct statement. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in D is incorrect. Because the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis, not necessarily the eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix operator, which is given in the standard basis. So D is incorrect.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think. The matrix operator is given in the standard basis (computational basis). The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are expressed in whichever basis they are in. If you diagonalize the matrix, the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis, which is different from the standard basis unless the matrix is already diagonal.

So, the statement in D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which would be correct only if the matrix is diagonal in that basis, which it is. So the eigenfunctions can form a basis for the vector space, but the given matrix is in the standard basis. So I'm not sure if D is correct in the context of the matrix operator given.

Hmm. Now, I'm getting a bit stuck between options C and D.

Wait, looking for which statement is correct during the calculation:

When calculating the eigenvalues, you solve (Ay - λ I)φ = 0. The solution gives you the eigenvectors φ, which are the eigenfunctions.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, and it commutes with Ay, this is correct. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenfunctions are a basis. So D is also correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is not about the basis for the whole space, but for the operator. So, the operator's matrix is in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are in their own basis. So during the calculation, the eigenfunctions are functions of that basis. So perhaps statement D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in D is correct in the sense that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's eigenspace. So during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for that operator's representation.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options. Only one is correct. So which one refers to something correct.

Looking at the options, let's check each.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me think about the given matrix S. The matrix S is:

[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

Which is the same as the Pauli Y matrix. So when you compute the eigenvalues, you find ±1, scaled by c.

So the eigenvalues are real, and eigenvectors are orthogonal. 

So, in any case, the correct eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real, so options A and B are out.

Between C and D, I think C is correct because the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² (since A² commutes with Ay) but not necessarily of Az, which does not commute.

So the correct answer is C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The operator is given by \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a matrix with the first row \((0, -i)\) and the second row \((i, 0)\). This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, which is Hermitian, making \( A_y \) also Hermitian. Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \), as \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix.
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), which are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

2. **Eliminating Options A and B:**
   - **Option A:** Suggests eigenvalues with imaginary parts (\( \pm 2\pi h \)) and real parts (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are entirely real.
   - **Option B:** Suggests eigenvalues with imaginary parts (\( \pm \frac{1}{2} \)) and real parts (\( \pm 1 \)). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are entirely real and equal to \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

3. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot generally be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the \( z \)-component of angular momentum) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This statement is correct.

4. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the eigenvectors of the matrix operator \( A_y \). These eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, as they are orthogonal and span the \( 2 \times 2 \) space. However, the matrix operator \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions are not necessarily the basis functions of the matrix operator. This statement is ambiguous and likely incorrect in the context of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), while also accounting for the non-commutativity with \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
