Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux question. Hmm, the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch of reactions in the Sun's core suddenly stops. I remember that the pp chain is a major process in the Sun's fusion, responsible for a lot of the energy production, especially in the core.

So, the Sun emits neutrinos from different processes. The main ones are from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I, II, and III branches. Oh wait, the question says the pp-III branch has stopped. So what does that mean for the neutrino production?

I think the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain. The pp chain produces helium-4 from protons, and one of the steps in that chain involves the emission of positrons and neutrinos. Oh right, in the pp-III branch, a boron-8 nucleus captures a proton to form lithium-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei. This process releases a lot of energy and emits neutrinos.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, the main source of neutrinos from that process would be cut off. But neutrinos also come from other processes, like the CNO cycle, right? Oh, but the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So does the CNO cycle continue unaffected?

But wait, the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV. The ratio is flux_band1 / flux_band2.

I remember that the neutrinos emitted from the different branches have different energy spectra. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the CNO cycle. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The pp chain's main neutrino emission is from the decay of boron-8, which produces 7 Be, which then decays into carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. The energy of those neutrinos is about 0.5 MeV or so. Or wait, no, maybe the pp-III branch produces lower-energy neutrinos compared to the CNO cycle. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the CNO cycle is more active in the Sun's core but the main neutrino emission from the pp chain occurs at lower energies. The CNO cycle's neutrinos are higher energy? Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the CNO cycle have a broader spectrum but higher average energies. The pp chain, particularly the pp-III branch, emits neutrinos in the PeV range? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, solar neutrinos are typically low-energy, on the order of a few hundred keV to a few MeV.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos. Let me think again. The main neutrino process in the pp chain is the decay of 7Be to 7Li plus a positron and a neutrino. The energy of the neutrino is around 0.862 MeV, I think. Because that's the Q-value for the beta-plus decay of 7Be. So that would be about 862 keV. So the neutrinos from pp-III are around 862 keV. So if the pp-III branch stops, then the flux in that energy region would drop.

So neutrinos from the CNO cycle have a different energy spectrum. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos when 13C captures a proton to become 14N, which then emits a neutrino when it decays. The energy of those neutrinos is around 1.4 MeV, I believe. So higher than the 862 keV from the pp-III branch.

Wait, but the question is about neutrinos from the Sun. So when the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos from that process (around 862 keV) would drop off. But the CNO cycle continues, so the flux from the CNO neutrinos would remain the same.

Wait, so the bands are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. The pp-III neutrinos are around 862 keV, which would fall into the 800-900 keV band (band 2). So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would decrease, but what about band 1?

Band 1 is 700-800 keV. So what neutrinos are in that band? Hmm, I thought the main source is the pp-III branch at 862 keV. So if that's cut off, the main flux in band 2 (around 862) would drop. But what about other sources, like the CNO cycle?

Wait, the CNO neutrinos are higher energy than 800 keV. So CNO neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is beyond the 900 keV band. So if the pp-III stops, the main flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would be from pp-III, but if that's gone, only CNO's lower-energy tail might contribute. But CNO's neutrinos are higher energy on average, so perhaps their contribution to band 2 is minimal compared to band 1?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the dominant source in the 800-900 keV band. So when pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop, while band 1's flux would remain because it's from the CNO cycle or another source.

Wait, but what are the other sources of neutrinos in the Sun? There's also the so-called 'other' neutrinos, like from the decay of 15O in the CNO cycle, which I think emit around 1.0 MeV. So higher than 800 keV. So in band 2, the main source is the pp-III neutrinos, which are at 862 keV.

So if the pp-III branch stops, then the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would drop, but the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would be less affected because it's from other sources like the CNO cycle's higher-energy neutrinos, but wait, CNO's neutrinos are higher than 800. So maybe the 700-800 keV band is where the CNO cycle doesn't contribute much, or perhaps the lower-energy tail of the CNO neutrinos would be in that band.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The neutrinos from the CNO cycle have energies up to about 1.4 MeV. So the lower end of their spectrum would be around, say, 0.5 MeV or so. So the CNO neutrinos would contribute to both band 1 and band 2, but their peak is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the main contribution to band 1 (700-800 keV) comes from the CNO cycle, while the main contribution to band 2 comes from the pp-III branch. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop a lot, while band 1 remains roughly the same.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio flux_band1 / flux_band2. If pp-III produces most of the neutrinos in band 2, and the CNO cycle contributes more to band 1, then after pp-III stops, band 2's flux would drop significantly, while band 1's flux remains about the same. So the ratio would increase.

Wait, but if the pp-III is the main source for band 2, and CNO contributes to band 1, then after pp-III stops, band 2's flux would decrease, so the ratio band1/band2 would go up.

Wait, let me think about the relative contributions. Suppose before the pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 is mostly from pp-III, and band 1 is from CNO. Then when pp-III stops, band 2's flux drops, and band 1 remains the same. So the ratio (band1/band2) increases.

But I'm not sure about the exact energy ranges. Let me try to remember the neutrino spectra. The standard solar neutrinos:

- The dominant pp-III neutrinos are around 862 keV, so in band 2 (800-900 keV).
- The CNO neutrinos are higher, around 1.4 MeV, but their spectrum extends down to lower energies as well. So maybe some of the CNO neutrinos are in band 2, but their main contribution is higher.

Wait, then band 2 would have contributions from both pp-III and some CNO. So if the pp-III stops, the band 2 flux would drop by the amount that the pp-III contributed. But what was the relative contribution?

If the pp-III neutrinos contribute, say, 80% of the flux in band 2, then stopping them would reduce band 2's flux by 80%. So band 2 would go from 80% pp-III + 20% CNO to just 20% CNO.

But if band 1's flux is mainly from CNO, which is a small part of their total emission, wait no. Because CNO neutrinos are higher energy, perhaps their contribution to band 1 (700-800 keV) is less than their contribution to band 2.

Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos contribute little to band 1 and more to band 2 and higher energies. So when pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 (which was mainly pp-III) drops, while band 1's flux comes from a different source, perhaps the CNO cycle's lower-energy tail or another process.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the production rates. The pp-III branch produces a significant number of neutrinos. If that's stopped, the flux would drop. So if before, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) was mainly from pp-III, and band 1 (700-800 keV) was from, say, the CNO cycle, then after stopping, band 2's flux would decrease.

But what is the ratio before and after? Before, the flux in band 2 was higher than band 1 because it was from a dominant source. After stopping, band 2's flux drops, so their ratio (band1 / band2) goes up.

Wait, but what if the CNO neutrinos contribute more to band 1 than band 2? Let's say that the CNO neutrinos have a distribution where more of them are in band 1 than in band 2. Then, when the pp-III is stopped, band 2's flux (which was mostly pp-III) would drop to a small value, while band 1's flux (which is from CNO, which is still active) remains roughly the same.

So the ratio (band1 / band2) would be much higher than before. So for example, if band1 was 100 before, and band2 was 1000, the ratio is 0.1. But after pp-III stops, band2 drops to say 100 (if CNO contributes 10%), then the ratio becomes (100)/(10) = 10. So the ratio would increase by a factor of 10.

But wait, the question says the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos take about 8 minutes to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, the effect would be felt now. So the neutrinos we detect now would reflect the solar activity 8 minutes ago. So the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, which is slightly before the neutrinos arrive. So the neutrinos we detect now are from the Sun as it was 8.5 minutes ago, i.e., with the pp-III stopped.

So, the neutrinos reaching us now come from the Sun's reactions 8.5 minutes ago. So the current production in the Sun's core has the pp-III stopped. But the neutrinos take 8.5 minutes to reach us, so the neutrinos we detect now are from a time when the pp-III was still running (since the Sun's core is the source, and if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted after that would have to come from elsewhere).

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So, the neutrinos that were emitted before that time are still traveling towards us. The neutrinos emitted after that (i.e., in the last 8.5 minutes) are from the pp-III process stopped, so they wouldn't contribute. Wait, no. The process stopped 8.5 minutes ago, so the neutrinos emitted from that process since then are zero. So the neutrinos that reach us now are the ones that were emitted before the process stopped, plus any neutrinos emitted during the 8.5-minute period, but since the process stopped, the neutrinos from that process in those 8.5 minutes would have been zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is hypothetical; perhaps we can assume that the pp-III stopped, and all other reactions continue. So the neutrinos from the pp-III would stop, but the others (like CNO) continue as usual.

So, if the pp-III is stopped, the neutrinos from that process are no longer emitted. So the neutrino flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would drop because that band was mainly filled by the pp-III neutrinos. The band 1 (700-800 keV) would be filled by other sources, like the CNO cycle.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos make up most of the flux in band 2, and the CNO neutrinos contribute more to band 1. So the ratio flux_band1 / flux_band2 would increase because band 2's flux drops.

But how much? If before, the pp-III contributed 90% of band 2's flux, and the CNO the other 10%, then stopping pp-III would reduce band 2's flux to 10% of original. If band 1's flux was 50% from CNO and 50% from pp-III, then after stopping, band 1 would drop to 50% of original (since pp-III contributes nothing). But wait, I'm not certain about the exact contributions.

Alternatively, I need to think about the specific energy bands. The pp-III neutrinos are at about 862 keV, so in band 2. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop significantly, but band 1's flux would remain mainly from other sources. Therefore, the ratio (band1 / band2) would increase.

But to get the ratio, perhaps the flux ratio is determined by the relative contributions of the processes. If the pp-III neutrinos were the main source in band 2, and CNO contributes more to band 1, then the ratio increases.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Let me think about the solar neutrino fluxes. The total solar neutrino flux is dominated by the pp-III branch, which accounts for about 90% of all solar neutrinos. The CNO cycle contributes the rest, around 10%. But that's the overall picture. But the neutrinos from the CNO cycle have higher energies on average.

So, looking at the energy bands:

Band 1: 700-800 keV
Band 2: 800-900 keV

The pp-III neutrinos are at 862 keV, so they fall into band 2. The CNO neutrinos have a broader spectrum, with a peak at around 1.4 MeV, but they also have a tail extending down to lower energies.

So, the total flux in band 1 would mostly come from the CNO neutrinos, but perhaps a small fraction from the pp-III. Since the pp-III neutrinos are at 862 keV, which is in band 2, their contribution to band 1 is negligible. So if the pp-III stops, band 1's flux remains roughly the same, while band 2's flux drops.

Wait, but that can't be right because the CNO neutrinos might have some in band 1. Let's say that the CNO neutrinos have a distribution that includes some in band 1 and more in band 2 and higher. So their contribution to band 2 is non-negligible.

Wait, let's make a rough estimate. Suppose that the CNO neutrinos contribute about 10% of the total neutrino flux, and their spectrum is such that 50% of them are above 800 keV. So, in band 2, CNO contributes 5% of the total flux, and pp-III contributes 85% (since pp-III produces 90% of all neutrinos, and all of them are in band 2). Then band 2's flux is 90% (pp-III) + 5% (CNO) = 95% of total, and band 1's flux is 5% (CNO) perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Perhaps another approach. The pp-III neutrinos are all at 862 keV, so they are in band 2. The CNO neutrinos have a distribution from about 0.5 MeV up to 1.4 MeV. So the number of CNO neutrinos in band 1 (700-800 keV) would be lower than in band 2 (800-900 keV), since their peak is higher.

Wait, that's not necessarily true. The number depends on the shape of the spectrum. The CNO neutrino spectrum is roughly a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. So higher energy neutrinos are less probable, but the total number at lower energies is higher.

Alternatively, the CNO neutrinos have a higher number at lower energies compared to higher energies. So, for example, in the CNO spectrum, the number of neutrinos between 700-800 keV might be higher than those between 800-900 keV.

Wait, I'm not certain, but perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux in band 1 than in band 2. Because their spectrum peaks at lower energies, but extends up. So their flux in band 1 could be higher than in band 2.

If that's the case, then the total for band 1 is dominated by CNO, and band 2 is dominated by pp-III. So when pp-III stops, band 2's flux drops dramatically, but band 1's remains roughly the same (since it's from CNO).

So the ratio (band1 / band2) would be roughly (CNO_band1) / (CNO_band2). Because pp-III contributes almost nothing to band1, and all to band2.

If the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux in band 1 than band 2, then the ratio would be greater than 1. But how much?

Alternatively, perhaps CNO neutrinos contribute about 10% to the total flux. Let's say that 60% of CNO neutrinos are in band 1, and 40% in band 2. So in band 1, you have 0.6 * 0.1 = 0.06 (6%) of total flux. In band 2, you have 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04 (4% of total flux). So the ratio would be 0.06 / 0.04 = 1.5.

But if the pp-III neutrinos contribute 90% of the total flux, which is all in band 2 (so 0.9 in band2), then the original ratio is (0.06)/(0.9 + 0.04) = 0.06/(0.94) ≈ 0.064. So band1/band2 was around 0.064.

After pp-III stops, the CNO neutrinos in band2 would contribute 0.04, and pp-III contributes nothing. So the new band2 flux is 0.04. The band1 flux is 0.06. So the ratio becomes 0.06 / 0.04 = 1.5.

But this is a very rough calculation. So the ratio would increase by a factor of about 20 (from 0.064 to 1.5). But the options given are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the dominant sources. If band2's flux is almost entirely from pp-III, and band1's flux is from CNO, then before the pp-III stops, band2 is much larger than band1. So the ratio is small.

But after pp-III stops, band2's flux drops to whatever CNO contributes, and band1's remains the same.

So if before, band1 was 1 unit and band2 was 100 units, then the ratio is 0.01. After stopping, band2 drops to say 10 units (if CNO contributes 10% of what pp-III did), and band1 remains at 1. So the ratio becomes 1/10 = 0.1.

But I'm not sure about the actual numbers. Alternatively, if pp-III contributes 90% of the neutrinos, and all of them are in band2, and CNO contributes 10% of the neutrinos, with 50% in band1 and 50% in band2.

So before stopping, band1 has 5% (10% * 0.5) and band2 has 90% + 5% = 95%. So the ratio is 5/95 ≈ 0.0526.

After stopping, band2 has only 5% from CNO. So the ratio becomes 5 /5 =1.

But the options don't have 1 as the answer in the same scenario. Wait, the options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

If the ratio becomes 1, then the correct answer would be C)1.

But wait, that's under the assumption that pp-III contributed 90% to band2, and CNO contributes equally to both bands. But in reality, perhaps CNO contributes more to band1 than band2.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux in band1 than in band2. So if the pp-III stops, the ratio increases.

But considering that the CNO neutrinos are higher energy, their flux in band2 (800-900) would be higher than in band1. So let's say that CNO contributes 80% of its neutrinos to band2 and 20% to band1.

So before stopping: band1 = 0.1 (from CNO) * 0.2 = 0.02; band2 = 0.9 (pp-III) + 0.1 *0.8 = 0.9 + 0.08 = 0.98.

So the ratio is 0.02/0.98 ≈ 0.02.

After stopping, band2 is 0.08. So the ratio becomes 0.02 / 0.08 = 0.25.

But this is not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are more abundant in band1 than band2. Let's suppose that CNO neutrinos make up about 10% of the total flux, and 60% of them are in band1, 40% in band2.

Before stopping: band1 = 0.1 *0.6 = 0.06; band2 = 0.9 (pp-III) + 0.1 *0.4= 0.94.

Ratio is 0.06/0.94 ≈ 0.064.

After stopping: band2 = 0.04. So ratio is 0.06 / 0.04 = 1.5.

But again, the options don't have 1.5.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The question is the ratio of band1 to band2. So what's the relative production of these neutrinos in the two bands.

If the pp-III branch is responsible for most of the neutrinos in band2, and CNO for most in band1, then after pp-III stops, band2's flux drops a lot, making the ratio larger.

Originally, band1 flux is from CNO, band2 mostly from pp-III.

Let me think about the actual neutrino spectrum. The pp-III neutrinos are a peak around 862 keV. So they contribute a significant number in band2. The CNO neutrinos have a broader spectrum, with a higher average energy, so their main contribution is in higher bands, but they also have a tail extending into band2 and band1.

So, the number of neutrinos in band1 from CNO might be lower than the number in band2. So if the pp-III stops, then band2's flux would drop by a large amount, making their ratio (band1/band2) increase.

But without exact numbers, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band2 is dominated by pp-III, and band1's flux is dominated by CNO. So after the pp-III stops, the ratio becomes (CNO_band1) / (CNO_band2).

If CNO_band2 is lower than CNO_band1, then the ratio would be greater than 1.

But I don't know the exact distribution. However, I recall that the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux at higher energies, meaning that in band2 (800-900 keV), the CNO neutrinos are more abundant than in band1 (700-800 keV). So the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, that would mean that if pp-III stops, band2's flux decreases, but the CNO contribution to band2 is less than CNO's contribution to band1. So the ratio band1 / band2 would be (CNO_band1) / (CNO_band2 + pp-III_band2). But when pp-III stops, the ratio becomes CNO_band1 / CNO_band2.

If CNO has more in band2 than band1, then band1's CNO contribution is less than band2's, so the ratio would be less than 1.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute about 90% of the flux in band2. So if they stop, band2's flux drops by 90%, so only 10% remains (from CNO). If CNO contributes 10% of the total neutrino flux, and 50% of that is in band1 and 50% in band2, then CNO_band1 is 5% and CNO_band2 is 5%. So after pp-III stops, band2's flux is 5% (from CNO), and band1's flux is 5% (from CNO). So the ratio is 1.

Wait, that would make the ratio 1.

But in this scenario, the pp-III contributed 90% of band2's flux (so band2 was 95% from pp-III and 5% from CNO), and band1 was 5% from CNO. So before stopping, the ratio is (5%) / (95%) = 0.0526.

After stopping, band2 is 5% (all from CNO), and band1 is 5% (from CNO), so the ratio is 1.

So the correct ratio would be 1, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos contribute more to band2 than band1.

Wait, another angle. Suppose that the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum where the number of neutrinos decreases with energy. So more neutrinos are in lower energy bands. Therefore, CNO neutrinos would contribute more to band1 than band2.

If that's the case, then after the pp-III stops, the ratio band1 / band2 would be (CNO_band1) / (CNO_band2).

If CNO_band1 is higher than CNO_band2, then the ratio would be greater than 1.

But without precise data, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 10. How?

If the pp-III neutrinos contribute almost all of band2's flux, and the CNO neutrinos contribute a small amount to both bands.

So, after the pp-III stops, band2's flux is only from CNO, which is much less than the original. So the ratio (band1 / band2) is band1_flux / band2_flux.

If band1_flux is, say, 10 times band2_flux, the ratio is 10.

But why would band1 be ten times band2 after the change?

Because CNO produces more in band1 than in band2.

But given that CNO neutrinos have higher energies, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos contribute more to band1 than band2. So band1 would have higher flux from CNO than band2. So the ratio becomes greater than 1.

But without exact data, I think the intended answer is option D)0.1.

Wait, another thought. The main neutrino source in the Sun is the pp-III branch. So when it stops, the majority of the neutrinos in band2 come from this process. So without it, band2's flux drops.

Suppose that the CNO neutrinos are about 10% of the total flux, and 10% of those are in band1 and 90% in band2.

So before stopping:

band1: 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01 (1% of total)
band2: 0.9 (pp-III) + 0.1 * 0.9 = 0.99 (99% of total)
ratio: 0.01 / 0.99 ≈ 0.01.

After stopping:

band2: 0.09 (CNO's 9% of 1% total flux? Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the total neutrino flux is dominated by pp-III, which contributes 90% to band2. The CNO contributes 10% of the total, with 90% in band2 and 10% in band1.

So, before stopping:

band1: 0.1 (CNO) * 0.1 (10%) = 0.01 (1% of total)
band2: 0.9 (pp-III) + 0.1 (CNO) *0.9 (90%) = 0.99 (99% of total)
ratio: 0.01/0.99 ≈ 0.01.

After stopping, pp-III stops, so:

band2 is only from CNO: 0.09 (9% of total)
band1 remains 0.01 (1% of total)
ratio: 0.01/0.09 ≈ 0.111.

Which is about 0.1, option D.

So the ratio would be approximately 0.1, which is option D.

Ah, so the correct answer is D)0.1.


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands (700-800 keV, band 1, and 800-900 keV, band 2) in the Sun after the pp-III branch of nuclear reactions in the solar core hypothetically stops. The pp-III branch is a significant source of neutrinos, primarily emitting at 862 keV, which falls within band 2. The CNO cycle, which continues unaffected, produces neutrinos with a broader energy spectrum, peaking at higher energies but extending into both bands.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Sources**:
   - The pp-III branch is the dominant source of neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV), contributing approximately 90% of the total neutrino flux.
   - The CNO cycle contributes the remaining 10% of the total neutrino flux, with its spectrum extending into both bands. However, CNO neutrinos are generally higher energy, so their contribution to band 1 (700-800 keV) is smaller compared to their contribution to band 2.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - When the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 drops significantly because the pp-III neutrinos are the primary contributors to this band.
   - Band 1's flux remains largely unaffected because it is dominated by the CNO cycle, which continues unaffected.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After**:
   - Before the pp-III branch stops, band 2's flux is dominated by pp-III neutrinos, while band 1's flux is smaller and mostly from the CNO cycle. The ratio of band 1 to band 2 flux is therefore small.
   - After the pp-III branch stops, band 2's flux drops to the contribution from the CNO cycle alone, while band 1's flux remains roughly the same. This causes the ratio of band 1 to band 2 flux to increase.

4. **Numerical Estimate**:
   - Assume the pp-III branch contributes 90% of the total neutrino flux, all in band 2. The CNO cycle contributes the remaining 10%, with 90% of its neutrinos in band 2 and 10% in band 1.
   - Before stopping:
     - Band 1 flux: \( 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \) (1% of total flux).
     - Band 2 flux: \( 0.9 + 0.1 \times 0.9 = 0.99 \) (99% of total flux).
     - Ratio: \( 0.01 / 0.99 \approx 0.01 \).
   - After stopping:
     - Band 2 flux: \( 0.09 \) (9% of total flux, from CNO).
     - Band 1 flux: \( 0.01 \) (1% of total flux, from CNO).
     - Ratio: \( 0.01 / 0.09 \approx 0.1 \).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2 after the pp-III branch stops is approximately **0.1**.
