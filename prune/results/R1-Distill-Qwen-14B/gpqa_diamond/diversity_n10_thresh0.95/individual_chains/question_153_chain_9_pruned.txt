Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part step by step.

First, the question has three different reactions labeled A, B, and C. Each reaction is a Michael addition, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I'll match them with the given options.

Starting with reaction A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, I'm thinking about what each reactant looks like.

Dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid, so its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. It's a good nucleophile because the enolate can form easily. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be CH2=CH-C6H4-tolyl-OCH3, but wait, the substituents are in the E configuration. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (the enolate) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Here, dimethyl malonate can form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So, the acrylate has the carbonyl at one end and the double bond. The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon (the CH2 part of CH2=CH-), adding to it. Then, the oxygen will attack the alpha carbon, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, but when the enolate attacks, it's adding across the double bond. So the product will have the two molecules connected. The malonate part will add to the acrylate.

So, the product of A should be a tricarboxylate. Let me draw this out mentally. The acrylate has a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. The malonate's enolate attacks the beta position (the second carbon) of the acrylate. So the structure becomes a longer chain with three carboxylate groups. Specifically, I think the product will be trimethyl something. Let me see: the acrylate is CH2=CH-C6H4-OTolyl-OCH3? Wait, no, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl substituent on the double bond? Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the central carbon. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but in this case, the substituent is on the double bond. So the structure is CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the formula is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3 with a substituent, but I think I'm mixing up the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, no, for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 3. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(=O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl substituent on the middle carbon. Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. No, that doesn't make sense because the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Oh wait, perhaps it's actually CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that's not likely. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, actually, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is (E)-3-(4-tolyl)prop-2-enoate methyl ester. So the double bond is between C2 and C3; the substituents on C3 are COOCH3 and a p-tolyl group. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3, but in the E configuration.

So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position, which is the CH2 part adjacent to the double bond. Wait, no, the enolate would attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. The alpha is the carbon next to the carbonyl, so in the acrylate, the alpha is the CH2 in CH2=CH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no. The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The alpha position is the CH2, beta is the CH. So in the Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta carbon (CH) of the acrylate. So the product will have the addition across the double bond, adding the malonate part to the beta carbon, and the oxygen will attack the alpha.

Wait, maybe I should think about the mechanism. The enolate (from dimethyl malonate) deprotonates to form a strong nucleophile. It attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate, which is the CH in CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the attack is on the CH, leading to a new bond between that carbon and the malonate.

After the attack, the oxygen will then attack the alpha carbon, closing the ring and forming a new structure. So the product would be a longer chain with two ester groups from the malonate and the p-tolyl group.

So, the product A would have the p-tolyl group attached to a carbon that's connected to another carbon, which has two ester groups. So the structure would be something like (CH2)2(COOEt)2 with a p-tolyl group.

Wait, but the acrylate's structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So when the enolate attacks the beta carbon (CH), the addition would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's carbon and the CH. Then, the oxygen from the carbonyl would attack the alpha carbon (CH2), leading to a four-membered ring? Or perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product after the addition would have the two ester groups (from dimethyl malonate) and the p-tolyl group on the same carbon. So the product would be a trimethyl ester with the structure (CH2)2(COOEt)2 attached to the p-tolyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Let me see: propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have three COOEt groups on carbons 1, 1, and 3. Wait, that would imply the central carbon is 2. Hmm, maybe that's correct. So the product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Looking at the options, option A and B have A as this structure, while options C and D have a different structure for A.

So moving on to reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with MeOH and H3O+.

Wait, the reactants are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The reagent is MeOH and H3O+, which suggests a proton source and perhaps a solvent.

Wait, but waitâ€”actually, the Michael addition usually involves a base to deprotonate the nucleophile. But in this case, the reagent is MeOH and H3O+, which is acidic. Hmm, maybe it's a different kind of addition, like a conjugate addition under acidic conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is a nucleophile, acting as a enamine or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack on the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile.

So, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a cyclic amine attached to a cyclohexenyl group. The structure is cyclohexene (with a double bond between C1 and C2) attached to a piperidine ring at position 1. So the piperidine is connected to C1 of the cyclohexene.

(E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN, with the E configuration, but wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CHCN with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So it's CH2=CHCN.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (enamine or amine) would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl or nitrile. But wait, nitriles can also participate in Michael additions as electrophiles. So the (E)-but-2-enenitrile has the structure CH2=CHCN.

In this reaction, the nucleophile is the piperidine derivative. Wait, but piperidine is a base. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexenylpiperidine acts as a nucleophile. Oh wait, cyclohexenylpiperidine is a conjugated system. The piperidine is a six-membered ring with one nitrogen, and the cyclohexene is attached at one position. So perhaps the lone pair on the nitrogen can form an enamine-like structure, making the adjacent carbon more nucleophilic.

Wait, but in Michael addition, the nucleophile is the enolate. So perhaps the piperidine's amine isn't acting as a base, but as a nucleophile in a conjugate addition. Alternatively, the piperidine may form an enamine with the cyclohexene, making the alpha position more nucleophilic.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexenylpiperidine is serving as the nucleophile, attacking the (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

Wait, but (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN. The alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. So the nucleophile would attack the beta carbon (the CH of CH2=CHCN), leading to a new bond between the nucleophile and the beta carbon.

So the piperidine part would add to the CH2 of CH2=CHCN, or the CH? Wait, the nucleophile would attack the beta position, which is the CH in CH2=CHCN. So the product would have the cyclohexenylpiperidine attached to the CH of the nitrile.

Wait, maybe I should think about the mechanism. The nucleophile (enamine or amine) attacks the beta carbon of the nitrile's double bond, adding to it, and then the nitrile's lone pair forms a new bond.

Wait, but nitriles can undergo conjugate additions similar to carbonyls. So, when the piperidine attacks the beta carbon, it would do so in a conjugate fashion, leading to a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

But wait, the product would then have a new carbon chain attached where the piperidine has added. Let me try to visualize this.

The (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN. The nucleophile attacks the CH2 part? Or the CH part?

Wait, no. The alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile is CH2-CH2-CN, but with a double bond. So the structure is CH2=CH-CN. The alpha is CH2, beta is CH. So the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon (CH), adding to it.

So after attack, the product would have the nucleophile attached to the beta carbon, and the nitrile would become a single bond, possibly leading to a new structure. Wait, but nitriles are less reactive than ketones for Michael additions, but I've heard that they can undergo such reactions under certain conditions.

So the product would have the piperidine-cyclohexenyl group attached to the beta carbon of the nitrile. So the nitrile is now connected to another carbon, which is connected to the piperidine-cyclohexenyl group.

So, the product would be something like (CH2CH2CN) attached to the piperidine group. Wait, but the but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN. After addition, the structure becomes CH2-CH(CN)-piperidinyl-cyclohexenyl group. Wait, maybe more accurately, the product would be a new molecule where the piperidine has added to the CH2 group, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a nitrile with an addition, but I think I'm not getting this right. Let me think about the options. The options for B are either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Wait, looking at option A for B: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. That would be a nitrile group attached to a butane chain, where the third carbon has a cyclohexyl group with a ketone (oxo) at position 2.

Alternatively, option B for B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile as well. Hmm, maybe I should think about whether the product is a ketone or an alcohol.

Wait, but the reagents for reaction B are MeOH and H3O+, which are acidic. So perhaps the addition leads to a protonation step. Let me think again: the nucleophile is the piperidine, which attacks the beta carbon of the nitrile's double bond. Then, the lone pair from the nitrile would form a new bond, perhaps leading to a ring formation or a new substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine adds to the nitrile in a way that forms a new carbon-nitrogen bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what is the structure of the product? The product is either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

So, if the product is butanenitrile with a substituent on the third carbon, which is a cyclohexyl group with either an oxo (ketone) or a hydroxyl group.

The starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So the piperidine is attached to the cyclohexene at position 1. The cyclohexene has a double bond between C1 and C2.

In the reaction, the piperidine's lone pair may form an enamine-like structure, making the adjacent carbon more nucleophilic. So the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen in the piperidine would attack the beta position of the nitrile.

Wait, but the nitrile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CHCN. The piperidine's nucleophilic carbon (say, the one adjacent to N) would attack the beta carbon (the CH in CH2=CHCN), leading to a new bond.

After the attack, the structure would have the piperidine-cyclohexenyl group attached to the CH of the nitrile. Then, perhaps the nitrile's triple bond would rearrange? Or maybe the oxygen from the solvent (MeOH) would protonate something.

Wait, considering the reagent is H3O+ and MeOH, perhaps after the addition, a proton is added somewhere. Maybe the cyclohexenyl ring becomes a cyclohexanol or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the addition leads to the formation of a new ring. Let me think: when the piperidine attacks the nitrile, maybe the cyclohexene ring becomes part of a larger ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on reaction B. Let me move on to reaction C and come back.

Reaction C is C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O â†’ 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the cyclohexane has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and at position 2, there's a butyl group with a ketone at position 3.

So the starting material C must be a nucleophile that can attack the but-3-en-2-one. The reagents are KOH and H2O, which suggests a basic condition for enolate formation.

But-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(H)COCH3. Wait, no: but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2COCH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but-3-en-2-one would have the structure CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, perhaps it's CH2=C-CO-CH3. Wait, but numbering would be: 1 2 3 4. But-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2-CO-CH2? No, maybe it's CH2=C-CH2-CO-CH3? No, perhaps it's (CH2)2-CO with a double bond. Alternatively, but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but has four carbons.

But-3-en-2-one: position 2 is the ketone, so structure is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that would make it CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=C-CH2-CO-CH3? No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C-CH2-CO-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH3? No, wait.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one. The 'but' implies four carbons. The 'en' indicates a double bond starting at position 3, and the 'one' indicates a ketone at position 2.

So the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C-CH2-C(=O)-, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C-CH2-C(=O)- something. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but that's butan-2-one, not enone.

Ah, perhaps it's (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2, but that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C-CH2-C(=O)-, but that's not correct either.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C-CH2-C(=O)-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2 but that's not possible because the double bond can't be after the ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the product. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the cyclohexane has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 which is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3.

So the butyl group is -CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, because the substituent is at position 3 of the butyl group.

Wait, the substituent is 3-oxobutyl, which would be -CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane. So the structure is cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent at position 2 being -(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH3? Or is it -(CH2)3-C(=O)-?

Wait, but 3-oxobutyl is CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-, so the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but butyl is four carbons, so 3-oxobutyl would be (CH2)3CO- group. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons. Wait, 3-oxobutyl would be CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2- as a substituent. So the substituent is -(CH2)3-C(=O)- attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, no, but the substituent is 3-oxobutyl, which is CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane. So, the substituent is at position 2 of the cyclohexane, making it 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, the starting material C must have been a nucleophile that adds to the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one) to form this product.

The reagents are KOH and H2O. KOH is a strong base, so it likely deprotonates the starting material to form an enolate, which then attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone in a conjugate addition.

So, the starting material C must be a compound that, when deprotonated, forms an enolate which can attack but-3-en-2-one.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Let me think about the structure of C. It must have a carbonyl group where the enolate forms, which then adds to the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent. So the starting material C must have been cyclohexane-1,3-dione itself? Or perhaps another structure.

Wait, no, because the product has a substituent at position 2, which wasn't present in C. So, perhaps C was a ketone that, upon enolate formation, adds to the but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, perhaps C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which upon treatment with KOH forms an enolate (at position 2?), which then adds to the but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, but in the product, the substituent is at position 2 of the cyclohexane, which is a 3-oxobutyl group. So the enolate from cyclohexane-1,3-dione would attack the but-3-en-2-one.

But then, where would the substituent come from? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound that, when treated with KOH, forms an enolate that adds to the but-3-en-2-one to form the product.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is a 3-oxobutyl group attached to position 2.

So, the but-3-en-2-one has the structure CH2=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, but that would be five carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the mechanism. The enolate of C attacks the but-3-en-2-one at the beta position, adding to it. Then, the carbonyl oxygen attacks, leading to a new bond.

But regardless, the product has a substituent from the but-3-en-2-one added to the cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, perhaps the starting material C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which upon enolate formation, adds to the but-3-en-2-one. Then, the product would have the substituent from the but-3-en-2-one added to the cyclohexane.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of the options.

Looking at the options, for reaction C, the product is either 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione or cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, the product given in the question for reaction C is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the options for C in the options are:

Option A: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option B: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option C: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option D: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which isn't listed in the options for C. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, no, looking back, the product in the problem statement is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is the product, so the options for C are the starting materials.

Wait, the question says: What are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions? So reaction C is C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH
