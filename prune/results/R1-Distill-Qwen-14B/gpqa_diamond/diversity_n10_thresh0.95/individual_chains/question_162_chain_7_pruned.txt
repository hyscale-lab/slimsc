Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I've heard the term pseudosphere before, but I'm not exactly sure what it is. I think it's like a surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? Oh wait, yeah, it's a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformally flat metric. So it's in two dimensions because we've got dx and dy. The general form of a 2D metric is often written as ds² = f(r)² (dr² + dθ²) in polar coordinates, but here they're using Cartesian coordinates, x and y.

I remember that for a pseudosphere, the metric can sometimes be written in terms of a function that depends on r² = x² + y². Let me think about the area element. The area element in 2D is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Since the metric here is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². Both are multiplied by the same factor, so det(g) = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

Wait, the area element would then be sqrt([32/(4 - x² - y²)]²) dx dy. The square and square root cancel out, so it's 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. So the area would be the integral of this over all x and y where the metric is defined.

What's the domain of this metric? The denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). To avoid singularities, the denominator shouldn't be zero, so x² + y² < 4. So the coordinates x and y are in a disk of radius 2. That makes sense because the radius of the pseudosphere is given as r=2.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is an infinite surface, isn't it? I think that's the case. So the metric might describe a surface that extends infinitely even though the coordinates are limited in radius. Or maybe I'm getting this mixed up with other surfaces.

Wait, let me think again. The metric given has a conformal factor that depends on (x² + y²), so as x² + y² approaches 4, the coefficient blows up. So maybe this is a model of hyperbolic space in the Poincaré disk model. In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. Comparing that to what's given here, if I set r² = x² + y², then the conformal factor becomes 32/(4 - r²). Wait, 32/(4 - r²) is 8 * (4)/(4 - r²), because 32 = 8*4. So that's 8 times (4/(4 - r²)).

But I'm not sure how this relates directly. The area of the pseudosphere... Wait, but in hyperbolic space, the area of a surface isn't finite. For example, the entire hyperbolic plane has infinite area. So if this is a model of hyperbolic space, then maybe the area is infinite.

Wait, the question specifically asks about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, what's the area of a pseudosphere? Alternatively, perhaps the metric is describing a pseudosphere (which is a finite area?), but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is that of a hyperbolic plane scaled somehow. Let me recall that the standard hyperbolic metric in the Poincaré disk model is ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radius in the disk. So in our case, the given metric is (32/(4 - r²)) (dx² + dy²) = [32/(4(1 - (r²/4)))] * (dx² + dy²) = [8/(1 - (r²/4))] * (dx² + dy²).

Wait, if r is sqrt(x² + y²), then r²/4 is (x² + y²)/4, so 4 - r² = 4(1 - (r²/4)), which means 32/(4 - r²) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)).

So the metric becomes ds² = [8/(1 - (r²/4))] (dx² + dy²) = (8) * (1/(1 - (r²/4))) (dx² + dy²).

But in the standard Poincaré disk model, the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²). Comparing to our case, maybe we can see a scaling factor. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is conformally equivalent to the Poincaré disk model.

But wait, let's think about the area. The area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, but the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a finite area surface. Wait, no, the pseudosphere is an infinite surface. Because when you look at the tractrix and extrinsically embed it, the pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent. So maybe the area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a sphere. Wait, if the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), and the radius is 2, then when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. So perhaps the metric is describing a sphere of radius 2, but with a conformal factor that makes it a hyperbolic space? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: in the given metric, the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy, where r² = x² + y². So to compute the area, we can perform a double integral over the disk r² <4.

But wait, isn't the integral of 32/(4 - r²) over r from 0 to 2 divergent? Let me check.

The area A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. Switching to polar coordinates, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So,

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Compute the integral over r:

Integral from 0 to 2 of [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me set u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So integral becomes 32 ∫ [1/u] (-du/2) from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2).

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0.

= -16 [ ln(u) ] from u=4 to u=0.

But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, but the limits are from 4 down to 0. So evaluating [ln(u)] from 4 to 0 is ln(0) - ln(4) which is (-infty) - (ln4). So the whole integral becomes -16 * (-infty - ln4) = 16*(infty + ln4), which is infinite.

So the area would be infinite. That suggests the area is +infty, which is option D.

But why is that? Because the metric is that of a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So the pseudosphere here, which is a model of hyperbolic space, has infinite area.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is a surface of revolution, right? Like the tractricoid. Is that an infinite area?

Wait, no. The tractrix is a curve of infinite length, but when you revolve it, the surface area might be finite or infinite. Let me think. The tractrix is the curve such that the distance from the origin to the tangent is constant. When you revolve it, the pseudosphere's surface area is finite. Wait, I thought the pseudosphere has finite area. Or is it?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the tractrix is asymptotic to a line, so the surface generated by revolving it around the asymptote is a pseudosphere. But does that surface have finite area? I think it does. Because as you approach the asymptote, the radius of the surface approaches zero, but the length is infinite. So the area might be finite.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for the area of a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given isn't of a pseudosphere but a hyperbolic plane.

Wait, the
