Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I guess we need to consider relativistic effects, which usually involve the gamma factor or something related to special relativity.

Wait, the setup says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator, mass m, maximum amplitude A. Hook's law is F = -kx. So the spring is obeying Hooke's law normally, but the mass is moving relativistically.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when the kinetic energy is maximum, which is when all the potential energy (1/2 k A²) is converted into kinetic energy. The KE is (1/2)mv²_max = (1/2)kA² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = (A) * sqrt(k/m). But wait, that's option C. But since it's relativistic, this might not hold because as speeds approach c, relativistic effects become significant.

Relativistic considerations: The total energy of the oscillator isn't just kinetic plus potential, but in the relativistic case, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. Also, in special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the approach here. Let's think about energy conservation. The total energy in the system would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude. Because in the oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the extremes (x=A), and kinetic is zero. Wait, but in the relativistic case, maybe the potential energy is considered differently? Or perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy from the spring.

Wait, so the total mechanical energy in the non-relativistic case is (1/2)kA², but relativistically, when the mass is at rest (x=A?), the potential energy is (1/2)kA², but the total energy is mc² + (1/2)kA². Oh wait, but no, because in the oscillator, when the mass is at maximum displacement, it's momentarily at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero, but the potential is maximum. So the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or is the total energy just the sum of rest energy and the potential energy? Hmm, maybe I should model it that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)kx² as usual, and when x is maximum, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)kA². But that doesn't include rest mass energy. Hmm, that's confusing. Because in relativity, the energy includes rest mass. So maybe the approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy, because when the mass is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But I'm not entirely sure.

Then, when the mass is at the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy is purely kinetic energy. So (gamma - 1)mc² = E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Wait, but if E is mc² plus (1/2)kA², then at equilibrium, KE is (gamma -1)mc².

Wait, let me write the equations:

At maximum displacement (x=A), the mass is momentarily at rest, so KE is zero. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², assuming it's the same as non-relativistic. So total energy E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

At equilibrium (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and kinetic energy is maximum. So KE = (gamma -1) mc² = E.

So,

(gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc²

Wait, that can't be right because the left side would be (gamma-1)mc², and the right is (1/2)kA² plus mc². Let's see:

Wait, let me write:

At x=A, the total energy E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

At x=0, the total energy E is (gamma) mc², because all the energy is kinetic plus rest mass. Wait, no, because the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc², so the total energy is (gamma) mc², yes.

So at x=0, E = (gamma) mc².

But also, E at x=A is (1/2)kA² + mc².

So set them equal:

gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Subtract mc² from both sides:

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2)kA².

Factor mc²:

mc² (gamma -1 ) = (1/2)kA².

So,

gamma -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²) → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call this term (k A²)/(2 m c²) as Q for simplicity.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + Q.

Take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1+Q).

Then square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1+Q)^2.

Which gives:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1+Q)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1+Q)^2 ].

But Q is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute that back in.

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ].

Hmm, let me compute 1/(1+Q)^2:

= 1/( (2 m c² +k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

= (2 m c²)^2 / (2 m c² +k A²)^2 )

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/(1+Q)^2:

1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )^2 = [ (2 m c² +k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^(-2) → [ (2 m c² +k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^(-2) → [ (2 m c²)/(2 m c² + k A²) ) ]^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / (2 m c² +k A² )^2 ].

Wait, maybe simplifying the expression.

Another approach: Let me compute the numerator 1 - 1/(1+Q)^2.

1 - 1/(1+Q)^2 = [ (1+Q)^2 - 1 ] / (1+Q)^2.

Expanding (1+Q)^2: 1 + 2 Q + Q². So,

[1 + 2 Q + Q² -1 ] / (1+Q)^2 = (2 Q + Q²) / (1+Q)^2.

Factor Q:

Q (2 + Q) / (1+Q)^2.

Hmm, but since Q is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is likely a small term because in normal cases, the spring constant isn't so high, but relativistic effects are negligible. But in the problem, it's given as a general case.

Wait, but let me go back. The expression for v_max^2 is c² [ 1 - 1/(1+Q)^2 ].

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1+Q)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ (1+Q)^2 - 1 ] / (1+Q)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (1 + 2 Q + Q^2 -1 ) ) / (1+Q )

= c * sqrt( (2 Q + Q^2 ) ) / (1+Q )

But perhaps it's better to leave it as is.

Wait, the options are given in terms of various expressions. Let's see the options:

Option D says v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Which is exactly what we have.

Wait, because,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + Q )^2 ]) → which is option D.

So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, let me double-check.

Because in the equation we derived:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ]

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 )

Which matches option D:

D) v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, the other options: Option A has a square root with 1 + ... which seems to relate to gamma, but I think that approach would be different. Option B has a sqrt(1 + ... ), which might not fit. Option C is the non-relativistic case.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. At \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At \( x = 0 \), the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is purely kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( Q = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + Q.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + Q},
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + Q)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + Q)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( Q = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A introduces an incorrect form with \( \sqrt{1 + \dots} \), which does not align with the derived expression.
- Option B has a similar issue with the incorrect sign and structure.
- Option C corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which neglects relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
