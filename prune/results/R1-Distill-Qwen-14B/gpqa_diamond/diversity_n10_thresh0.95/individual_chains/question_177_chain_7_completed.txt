Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Hmm, right, luminosity is the total energy a star emits, right?

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So if Star_2's radius is R, then Star_1's is 1.5R. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. I'm not sure how the mass plays into this yet, but maybe it's a red herring or maybe it relates to something else like the blackbody radiation.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, the peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same, since b is a constant. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So yeah, using the blackbody radiation laws applies here.

Next, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But luminosity is an intrinsic property, so the Doppler shift due to radial velocity affects the observed wavelengths but not the intrinsic brightness. Because when you have a Doppler shift, the observed wavelength changes, but the star's actual emission characteristics are based on its rest frame. Hmm. So the observed wavelengths are shifted, but the actual emission peaks are based on the star's temperature.

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe that's the observed wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, the observed λ_max would change. Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So perhaps that's the same observed wavelength. So Star_1 has a rest frame λ_max1, and Star_2 has a rest frame λ_max2, but due to their velocities, their observed λ_max are the same.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So when calculating the luminosity, are we considering their rest frame or observed frame?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let's think. Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, so it doesn't depend on the observer's frame. The Doppler effect would change the observed flux, but the actual luminosity is an intrinsic property. So when the problem says they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor, they are probably considering the rest frame properties.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So if both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, that would mean their rest frame temperatures are adjusted by the Doppler shift. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ would be blueshifted, implying higher temperature. Conversely, if moving away, redshifted, implying lower temperature.

Wait, let's formalize this. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer (positive if moving towards). But wait, I think the exact formula might differ based on approximation. Alternatively, the relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is λ = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but I might have that wrong.

Alternatively, another approach: the observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest by λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. The redshift z is determined by the radial velocity. For non-relativistic speeds (which these velocities are, 700 km/s is a fraction of the speed of light), the redshift z is approximately v/c. So z ≈ v/c.

So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But wait, if the velocity is towards us (since Star_2's radial velocity is positive, I think it's moving towards us). So Star_2 is moving towards us, which causes a blueshift, so its observed λ_max is shorter than its rest λ_max. But in the problem, Star_1's observed λ_max is the same as Star_2's. So their observed λ_max are equal.

Wait, because both have the same observed λ_max, but Star_1 is at rest (v=0), so its observed λ_max equals its rest λ_max. Star_2 is moving towards us with v=700 km/s, so its observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )? Or is it the other way around? Wait, if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so λ_obs is smaller. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ). Because when v is positive (moving towards), the denominator and numerator change.

Wait, maybe I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. The formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ) )

where β = v/c.

Alternatively, another form is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), and the redshift z can be approximated for small velocities as z ≈ v/c. But wait, when the source is moving towards the observer, z is negative, which would correspond to a blueshift.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact Doppler shift formula. So for a source moving towards the observer with velocity v, the observed wavelength λ is related to the rest wavelength λ0 by:

λ = λ0 * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ) )

where β = v/c.

Because when the source moves towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshift), so λ < λ0.

But since in this problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, and Star_1 is at rest (v=0), its observed wavelength is λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Star_2 is moving towards us with v=700 km/s, so its observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β = 700e3 m/s divided by the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. So β ≈ 700e3 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333.

So for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) ) = λ2_rest * sqrt( (0.997667)/(1.002333) ) )

Let me compute that denominator and numerator. Let me approximate sqrt( (1 - 2β)/(1 + 2β) ) approximately as 1 - 2β, using a binomial expansion since β is small. Wait, let's see:

(1 - β)/(1 + β) ≈ (1 - 2β) when β is small. So sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 2β) ≈ 1 - β.

So therefore, λ2_obs ≈ λ2_rest * (1 - β).

But wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Compute (1 - β)/(1 + β) = (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99533.

Then sqrt(0.99533) ≈ 0.99766.

So λ2_obs ≈ λ2_rest * 0.99766.

But since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But Star_1's observed λ is its rest λ, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 0.99766.

Wait, but wait, let's write the equation:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So the ratio of λ1_rest to λ2_rest is sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which can be rewritten as sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ), with β= v/c.

So let's compute this ratio.

v = 700 km/s. c is about 299,792 km/s, so v/c ≈ 0.002334.

So (1 - β) = 0.997666, (1 + β)= 1.002334.

Their ratio is (0.997666)/(1.002334) ≈ 0.99533. The square root of 0.99533 is approximately 0.99766.

So λ1_rest ≈ 0.99766 * λ2_rest.

Therefore, λ1_rest / λ2_rest ≈ 0.99766.

But from Wien's law, λ_max = b / T, so λ1_rest / λ2_rest = T2_rest / T1_rest.

Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ1_rest = (b/T1) and λ2_rest = (b/T2), then λ1_rest/λ2_rest = T2 / T1.

From earlier: λ1_rest / λ2_rest ≈ 0.99766 = T2 / T1.

So T2 = T1 * 0.99766.

Hmm, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the ratio. Let's re-express:

λ_max1 = b / T1 => T1 = b / λ_max1.

Similarly, T2 = b / λ_max2.

Then λ_max1 / λ_max2 = T2 / T1.

But in our case, λ_max1 is Star_1's rest frame, which equals Star_2's observed λ_max, which is λ2_obs.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me reorganize.

Star_1 is at rest, so its observed λ_max is λ1_rest.

Star_2 is moving towards us, so its observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

But the problem says λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Therefore, λ1_rest / λ2_rest = sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Which, as computed, is approximately 0.99766.

But since λ_max = b / T, we can write λ1_rest / λ2_rest = T2_rest / T1_rest.

So T2_rest = T1_rest * (λ1_rest / λ2_rest) ) = T1_rest * 0.99766.

So T2 is approximately 0.99766 times T1.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 0.99766.

So the temperature of Star_2 is a bit lower than that of Star_1, but very close.

Now, moving on to luminosity. The luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4.

Similarly, L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4.

We need to find the ratio L1 / L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5.

T2 = T1 * 0.99766.

So T2/T1 = approx 0.99766.

So let's plug into the ratio:

L1/L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * (T1/T2)^4 )

= (1.5)^2 * (1 / 0.99766)^4

Compute each part.

1.5 squared is 2.25.

Now, (1/0.99766) is approximately 1.002345.

So (1/0.99766)^4 ≈ (1.002345)^4.

What's 1.002345^4? Let's compute that.

We can approximate using the binomial expansion: (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + n(n-1)x²/2 + ... for small x.

Here, x = 0.002345.

So (1.002345)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002345) + 6*(0.002345)^2 + 4*(0.002345)^3 + (0.002345)^4.

Compute each term:

4*0.002345 = 0.00938.

6*(0.002345)^2 = 6 * (approx 0.0000055) ≈ 0.000033.

4*(0.002345)^3 ≈ 4*(1.28e-8) which is about 5.12e-8, negligible.

(0.002345)^4 is even smaller, about 3e-11, so negligible.

Adding up the first two terms: 0.00938 + 0.000033 = 0.009413.

So (1.002345)^4 ≈ 1.009413.

So the factor (T1/T2)^4 = (1/0.99766)^4 ≈ 1.009413.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009413 ≈ 2.271.

Wait, but let me check that calculation. Because 1.5 squared is 2.25, and 1.002345^4 is approximately 1.0094, so 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the choices are around 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.

So 2.27 isn't exactly matching any option. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute (1/0.99766) more accurately and then calculate its fourth power precisely.

Wait, 0.99766 ≈ 1 - 0.00234.

So 1/0.99766 = 1 + 0.00234 + (0.00234)^2 + ... (using 1/(1-x) = 1 + x + x² + ... )

So x = 0.00234.

So 1/0.99766 ≈ 1 + 0.00234 + (0.00234)^2 + ... which is approximately 1.00234 + (0.000005476) ≈ 1.0023455.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute 1/0.99766 exactly.

0.99766 is the denominator.

Let me compute 1 / 0.99766.

Let me calculate it numerically.

0.99766 ≈ 0.99766.

1 / 0.99766 ≈ ?

Let me compute it step by step. Let me approximate 1 / 0.99766.

Let me write it as (1 + 0.00234)⁻¹. Wait, no, 0.99766 is 1 - 0.00234, so 0.99766 = 1 - 0.00234.

Wait, no: 1 - 0.00234 is 0.99766.

So 1/(1 - 0.00234) ≈ 1 + 0.00234 + (0.00234)^2 + (0.00234)^3 + ... 

So 1/0.99766 ≈ 1 + 0.00234 + 0.000005476 + ... which is approximately 1.0023455.

So 1.0023455^4 = ?

Let me compute 1.0023455^2 first.

(1.0023455)^2 = (1 + 0.0023455)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.0023455 + (0.0023455)^2 = 1 + 0.004691 + 0.0000055 ≈ 1.0046965.

Then, (1.0046965)^2 = ?

Again, (1 + 0.0046965)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.0046965 + (0.0046965)^2.

So that's 1 + 0.009393 + 0.000021996 ≈ 1.009415.

So 1.0023455^4 ≈ 1.009415.

So then L1/L2 is 2.25 * 1.009415 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm, but the options are: A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

So 2.27 is not exactly matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute (T1/T2) more accurately.

Wait, I have:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So the ratio λ1_rest/λ2_rest is sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), which is sqrt( (1 - 0.0023333)/(1 + 0.0023333) )

Let me compute (1 - 0.0023333) = 0.9976667.

(1 + 0.0023333) = 1.0023333.

So the ratio is 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 = ?

Let me compute this division:

0.9976667 ÷ 1.0023333.

Let me compute it as:

≈ (1 - 0.0023333) / (1 + 0.0023333) = (1 - x)/(1 + x), where x = 0.0023333.

Which is approximately (1 - 2x + x²) for small x, because (1 - x)/(1 + x) = (1 - x)(1/(1 +x)) ≈ (1 - x)(1 - x + x²) ≈ 1 - 2x + 2x².

So x = 0.0023333.

So 2x = 0.0046666.

So (1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - 2x = 1 - 0.0046666 = 0.9953334.

So sqrt(0.9953334) is sqrt(0.9953334) ≈ 0.99766.

Wait, but when I compute sqrt(0.9953334), perhaps it's better to compute it accurately.

Let me calculate: 0.99766 squared is approximately (0.99766)^2 = 0.995327. That's very close to 0.9953334. So sqrt(0.9953334) ≈ 0.99766.

So λ1_rest = 0.99766 * λ2_rest.

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, so T1 = b / λ1_rest, T2 = b / λ2_rest.

So T1 = (b) / (0.99766 λ2_rest) ) = (1/0.99766) * (b / λ2_rest) ) = (1.00234) * T2.

So T1 =1.00234 * T2.

Therefore, T1/T2 = 1.00234.

So the ratio (T1/T2) is about 1.00234.

So when we compute (T1/T2)^4, that's (1.00234)^4.

Which as I calculated earlier is approximately 1.00941.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1.00941) = 2.25 * 1.00941 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm, again, 2.271 is not one of the options. The options are A) 2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift. Let me re-examine that.

Another approach: Since Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter than its rest wavelength. And Star_1's observed wavelength is its rest wavelength.

So, for Star_2, λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But in the problem, λ_obs for both stars is the same, so:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So λ2_rest = λ1_rest / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

Which is λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ), where β = v/c.

So, from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

So T2 = (b) / λ2_rest = (b) / (λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ) )

T1 = (b) / λ1_rest.

Thus, T2 = T1 / sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) )

= T1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Which is the same as before. So T2 = T1 * 0.99766.

Wait, so T1 = T2 / 0.99766 ≈ T2 * 1.00234.

So (T1/T2) ≈ 1.00234.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00941.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.00941 = 2.25 * 1.00941 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm, but the options don't have 2.27. The closest is option B) ~2.32, but that's a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe I should consider relativistic Doppler shift without approximation.

Wait, let's compute the exact Doppler shift.

Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. c is 299792 km/s.

So v = 700,000 m/s.

c = 299,792,458 m/s.

So β = v/c = 700000 / 299792458 ≈ 0.0023375.

So exact calculation:

(1 - β) = 1 - 0.0023375 = 0.9976625.

(1 + β) = 1.0023375.

So (1 - β)/(1 + β) = 0.9976625 / 1.0023375.

Let me compute this division.

0.9976625 ÷ 1.0023375.

Hmm, let's compute it as:

≈ (approx 0.9976625) / (1.0023375) = 0.9976625 / 1.0023375.

Let me compute this as 0.9976625 * (1 / 1.0023375).

1 / 1.0023375 ≈ 0.9976625.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.0023375 is 1 + 0.0023375.

So 1 / 1.0023375 ≈ 0.9976625.

Wait, I think that's correct because (1.0023375)(0.9976625) ≈ 1.

So 1.0023375 * 0.9976625 = 1.0000000006, which is approximately 1.

So, (1 - β)/(1 + β) = 0.9976625 / 1.0023375 = 0.99534.

Wait, wait, let's compute it.

Wait, 0.9976625 ÷ 1.0023375.

Let me compute:

0.9976625 ÷ 1.0023375 ≈ 0.99533.

Wait, same as before.

So sqrt(0.99533) ≈ 0.99766.

So same as before.

Hmm, so I'm back to L1/L2 ≈ 2.27.

Wait, but what if the problem considers the Doppler shift for luminosity? Because when a star is moving, the observed flux changes due to the Doppler effect. But in this problem, the luminosity refers to the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed flux.

Because the problem states, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So the luminosities are intrinsic, so Doppler shift doesn't affect them.

Wait, but the question mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max are the same. So that would influence the calculation of their temperatures, which in turn affects luminosity.

So perhaps my initial approach is correct, and the answer should be approximately 2.27, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the Doppler effect.

Wait another approach: Maybe the problem is about flux, not luminosity. Because flux depends on distance and Doppler shift. But the problem says they computed the luminosity, so that's the intrinsic brightness.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler effect affects how the peak wavelengths are observed, but the luminosity calculation is based on their rest frame properties.

So perhaps I should ignore the Doppler effect for the luminosity and only use the observed λ_max for temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars are radiating as blackbodies, and the observed λ_max are the same. So to find their temperatures, we have to account for Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is stating that the peak emission wavelengths are the same when observed, so the stars' rest frames have different temperatures.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed without considering the Doppler shift and see what happens.

Wait, no, that's not right because the problem specifically says that the observed λ_max are the same, which would imply that the rest frame λ_max are different, leading to different temperatures.

But maybe I should think differently. Let me try to approach it from another angle.

The problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, and that the observed λ_max are the same. So the calculated temperatures for each star would be based on their observed λ_max. But since they are at different velocities, their rest temperatures would be different.

Wait, but no. Because the observed λ_max is used to compute the star's temperature. For Star_1, since it's at rest, observed λ_max is the same as rest λ_max, so T1 is calculated normally. For Star_2, it's moving, so the observed λ_max is shorter than its rest λ_max. So when we apply Wien's law, T2_obs = b / λ2_obs. But the actual rest temperature is higher because of the blueshift.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that the observed λ_max are the same for both. So when we calculate the temperature using observed λ_max, both T1 and T2 would be the same as per the observed λ_max.

Wait, but that can't be right because if their rest temperatures are different, but observed λ_max are same, that would imply same observed T, but different rest T.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the stars' rest peak wavelengths are the same. But no, the problem says the observed are the same.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the observed λ_max is the same, so when calculating the temperatures for each star, we have to account for their velocities.

Wait, let me think. When a star is moving towards us, its observed λ_max is shorter than its rest λ_max. So for Star_2 to have the same observed λ_max as Star_1, which is at rest, Star_2 must have a longer rest λ_max, meaning a lower temperature.

So, the observed λ_max is the same for both. So:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * ( observed Doppler factor )

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

Thus, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Then, using Wien's law:

λ = b / T => T = b / λ.

So T1 = b / λ1_rest.

T2 = b / λ2_rest.

So T1 = (b) / (λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )) )

= (b/λ2_rest) * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) )

= T2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So T1 is higher than T2.

Thus, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ≈ sqrt( (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) ) ≈ sqrt(1.004666) ≈ 1.00233.

Hmm, wait, that's different from earlier. Let me compute sqrt(1.004666).

sqrt(1.004666) ≈ 1.00233.

So T1 = T2 * 1.00233.

Then, (T1/T2)^4 = (1.00233)^4.

Again, approximate using binomial expansion.

(1.00233)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.00233) + 6*(0.00233)^2 + ... 

4*0.00233 = 0.00932.

6*(0.00233)^2 =6 * 0.00000543 ≈ 0.00003258.

So sum is 0.00932 + 0.00003258 = 0.00935258.

So (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00935.

So now, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

= (1.5)^2 * 1.00935.

= 2.25 * 1.00935 ≈ 2.271.

Again, same result.

But the options are B) ~2.32, which is higher than 2.27. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the exact (1.00233)^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact numbers without approximation.

Let me compute (1.00233)^2:

1.00233 * 1.00233 = ?

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.00233 = 0.00233.

0.00233 *1= 0.00233.

0.00233 *0.00233 ≈ 0.0000054289.

So sum:

1 + 0.00233 + 0.00233 + 0.0000054289 = 1 + 0.00466 + 0.0000054289 ≈ 1.0046654289.

So (1.00233)^2 ≈ 1.0046654289.

Then, square that to get the fourth power.

(1.0046654289)^2 = ?

Let me compute 1.0046654289 * 1.0046654289.

Approximating:

= 1 + 2*0.0046654289 + (0.0046654289)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.0093308578 + 0.000021765 ≈ 1.0093526228.

So (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.0093526.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0093526 ≈ 2.271.

Still around 2.27.

Hmm. The options don't have 2.27, but option B is 2.32, which is higher. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the luminosity is calculated using the observed flux, which is affected by the Doppler shift.

Oh, wait! Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, but when calculating flux (the observed power per unit area), it's affected by distance and Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using blackbody radiation. So maybe they accounted for the Doppler shift when determining the star's properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the apparent brightness, but that's not what the question states.

Wait, no, the question says they computed the luminosity, so it's the intrinsic property. So the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength but not the luminosity.

But the problem says that the observed λ_max are the same, which allows us to find the temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the luminosity formula again.

L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So if I have R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ), then:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Which is (1.5)^2 * [sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )]^4.

= 2.25 * [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ]^2.

Because [sqrt(x)]^4 = x^2.

So compute (1 + β)/(1 - β) = (1 + 0.0023333)/(1 - 0.0023333) = 1.0023333 / 0.9976667.

Which is approximately 1.004666.

So (1.004666)^2 = approx 1.00934.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00934 ≈ 2.271.

Same as before.

So the calculated factor is approximately 2.27, which isn't an option. The closest option is B) ~2.32, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the Doppler shift for the temperature.

Wait, another approach: The observed flux is affected by the Doppler shift. The observed flux is F = L / (4π d²) * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity. Because when a star is moving towards us, more flux is received, increasing the observed flux.

But wait, that's about the observed flux, not the luminosity. The luminosity is an intrinsic property, so it's not affected by Doppler shift. So that shouldn't be considered here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's surface brightness (emissive power per unit area) is affected by the Doppler shift, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler shift in the calculation of the temperature from the observed spectrum. So when looking at Star_2, which is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, implying higher temperature. But because the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1, the calculated temperature from λ_max would be the same.

Wait, that can't be right because if both observed λ_max are the same, then their temperatures would be the same when calculated using Wien's law. But that contradicts because Star_1's temperature would be higher than Star_2's.

Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the observed λ_max is the same for both, but this is due to their actual temperatures being different because of their velocities. So when using observed λ_max, the temperatures would be the same, but their rest temperatures are different.

Wait, let's think: For Star_1, observed λ_max = λ1_rest. For Star_2, observed λ_max = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

So if they have the same observed λ_max, then λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Thus, λ1_rest / λ2_rest = sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

From Wien's law: T1 = b / λ1_rest; T2 = b / λ2_rest.

So T1 = T2 * (λ2_rest / λ1_rest ) = T2 * 1/(sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )) ) = T2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - beta) )

So T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Which is higher than T2.

Thus, when calculating luminosity, using the rest frame parameters:

L1 = 4pi R1² sigma T1^4.

L2 = 4pi R2² sigma T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

= (1.5)^2 * [ sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ]^4.

= 2.25 * [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ]^2.

Because [sqrt(x)]^4 = x^2.

So compute (1 + β)/(1 - β) = (1 + 0.0023333)/(1 - 0.0023333) ≈ 1.0023333 / 0.9976667 ≈ 1.004666.

So (1.004666)^2 = approx 1.00934.

Thus, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00934 ≈ 2.271.

So again, same result.

Hmm, none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, which impacts the calculation of luminosity. Because when a star is moving towards us, the observed flux is higher, but luminosity is an intrinsic property. So perhaps the Doppler shift is already accounted for in the calculation of luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the Doppler shift effect on the temperature, which would be a mistake, but perhaps that's what leads to one of the options.

If I ignore Doppler shift, then λ1_rest = λ2_rest, so temperatures are same. Then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Which is option A.

But that doesn't account for the Doppler effect, which seems incorrect because the problem states that the observed λ_max are the same. So perhaps the intended answer is 2.25, option A, but that seems to ignore the temperature difference due to Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended for the stars to have the same temperature, hence L ratio would be 2.25, but that contradicts the given that their observed λ_max are same but velocities are different.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option B) ~2.32.

Wait, how?

Wait, let me compute (1 + β)/(1 - β) exactly.

β = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s.

c = 299,792,458 m/s.

β = 700,000 / 299792458 ≈ 0.0023375.

So (1 + β) = 1.0023375.

(1 - β) = 0.9976625.

(1 + β)/(1 - β) = 1.0023375 / 0.9976625 ≈ 1.004667.

Compute [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 = (1.004667)^2.

1.004667^2 = ?

1^2 = 1.

2 * 1 * 0.004667 = 0.009334.

0.004667^2 ≈ 0.000021778.

Sum: 1 + 0.009334 = 1.009334 + 0.000021778 ≈ 1.0093557.

So [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 = 1.0093557.

Then, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0093557 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm computing the Doppler shift. Let me check the Doppler shift formula again.

The correct Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ).

Which is what I used earlier. So that part should be correct.

So, perhaps the answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to L1/L2=2.25, which is option A.

But that would ignore the fact that the observed λ_max are same, implying different rest temperatures.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute using non-relativistic Doppler shift, which is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

Wait, wait, the relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), but for small velocities, it can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - β).

So maybe the problem expects using this approximation.

So let's try that.

Using λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - β).

So, Star_2's observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 - β).

And since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 - β).

From Wien's law, λ_max = b / T.

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 - β) => (b / T1) = (b / T2) (1 - β).

So, T2 = T1 (1 - β).

Thus, T1 = T2 / (1 - β).

So, the ratio T1/T2 = 1/(1 - β) ≈ 1 + β + β² + ... ≈ 1 + β (for small β).

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1 + β)^4 ≈ 1 + 4β + 6β² + ... 

With β=0.0023375, 4β = 0.00935, 6β²≈ 6*(0.00000546) ≈ 0.0000328.

So, (1 + β)^4 ≈ 1.00938.

Thus, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.271.

Again, same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to ~2.27, but the options don't include this. Perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, but I might have to re-express the calculation more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute without any approximation.

Let me compute (1 + β)/(1 - β) exactly.

β = 0.0023375.

(1 + β)/(1 - β) = 1.0023375 / 0.9976625.

Compute this division accurately.

Let me compute 1.0023375 ÷ 0.9976625.

= (1 + 0.0023375) / (1 - 0.0023375).

We can write this as (1 + a)/(1 - a), where a=0.0023375.

We can use the approximation (1+a)/(1-a) ≈ 1 + 2a + 2a² for small a.

So, 1 + 2a = 1 + 2*0.0023375 = 1.004675.

2a² = 2*(0.0023375)^2 = 2*(0.000005465) ≈ 0.00001093.

So, (1+a)/(1-a) ≈ 1.004675 + 0.00001093 = 1.00468593.

So, (1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ 1.00468593.

So, [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 = (1.00468593)^2.

= 1.009417.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009417 ≈ 2.271.

Same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 2.27, but that's not among the options. Therefore, I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the Doppler effect on the temperature, and the observed λ_max being the same is just a distraction. So, if both stars have the same observed λ_max, then their calculated temperatures are the same, leading to luminosity ratio (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But that would ignore the Doppler effect's impact on temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the luminosity using the observed flux, which would be affected by the Doppler shift.

Wait, but that would change the observed flux, not the intrinsic luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the stars' luminosities are computed assuming that the observed wavelengths are their emission peaks. So perhaps the temperature used in the Stefan-Boltzmann law is the observed temperature, which would be the same for both stars.

In that case, T1 = T2.

Then, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But that doesn't align with the Doppler shift because Star_2's observed λ_max would imply a higher temperature.

Wait, but if the observed λ_max are the same, then the calculated temperatures would be same, but their actual (rest) temperatures are different.

Wait, but the problem says that when calculating luminosity, they assumed blackbody radiation. So perhaps the temperature used is the rest temperature, which is determined by the observed λ_max adjusted for Doppler shift.

But I'm not sure. I'm getting stuck between 2.25 and 2.27.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the Doppler shift to compute the rest temperature, and then use that to find the luminosity.

So, with T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ), as before.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2.

Which is 2.25 * (1.004667)^2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00935 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Without the correct option, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32.

But wait, another approach: Let me compute the exact value of (1 + β)/(1 - β) where β = 700e3 / 299792e3 = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.0023375.

So (1 + β ) = 1.0023375, (1 - β )= 0.9976625.

So (1.0023375) / (0.9976625) = ?

I can compute this as:

1.0023375 ÷ 0.9976625 = ?

= (1 + 0.0023375) / (1 - 0.0023375) = (1 + a)/(1 - a), where a=0.0023375.

The exact value is approximately 1.004667.

Thus, [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 = (1.004667)^2 ≈ 1.00935.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00935 = 2.271.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but that's lower than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), for non-relativistic speeds.

Wait, no, that's the non-relativistic approximation. The correct relativistic formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), but for small β, it can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - β).

So perhaps the problem expects using the non-relativistic Doppler shift, which is λ_obs = λ_rest (1 + v/c).

Wait, no, if the source is moving towards us, v is positive, so the observed wavelength is λ_rest (1 - v/c).

Wait, the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

f_obs = f_rest (1 + v/c ), when the source is moving away.

When moving towards, it's (1 - v/c).

But wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency, so λ_obs = λ_rest (1 + v/c ) when source moves away, and λ_obs = λ_rest (1 - v/c ) when moving towards.

So in the problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, meaning moving towards us.

So λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 - v/c ) = λ2_rest (1 - 0.0023375 ) = λ2_rest * 0.9976625.

Star_1 is at rest, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 0.9976625.

From Wien's law, λ = b / T, so T = b / λ.

Thus, T1 = b / λ1_rest = b / (λ2_rest * 0.9976625 ) = (b / λ2_rest ) * (1/0.9976625 ) = T2 * 1.0023375.

So T1 = T2 * 1.0023375.

Thus, T1/T2 = 1.0023375.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (1.0023375)^4.

Compute (1.0023375)^4.

Using binomial expansion:

(1.0023375)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.0023375) + 6*(0.0023375)^2 + 4*(0.0023375)^3 + (0.0023375)^4.

Compute each term:

4 * 0.0023375 = 0.00935.

6 * (0.0023375)^2 =6 * 0.000005465 ≈ 0.00003279.

4 * (0.0023375)^3 ≈4 * 0.00000001279 ≈ 0.00000005116.

(0.0023375)^4 ≈ 0.0000000002965.

Summing up:

0.00935 + 0.00003279 = 0.00938279.

Add the other terms, which are negligible: 0.00000005116 + 0.0000000002965 ≈ 0.000000051456.

Total ≈ 0.00938284 + 0.000000051456 ≈ 0.00938289.

So (1.0023375)^4 ≈ 1.00938289.

Thus, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.00938289 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00938289 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm, same result.

I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option B) ~2.32, but I don't see how to get that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without any approximation.

Let me compute (1.0023375)^4 exactly.

Compute 1.0023375^2 = ?

1.0023375 * 1.0023375.

= 1 + 2*0.0023375 + (0.0023375)^2.

= 1 + 0.004675 + 0.000005465.

= 1.004680465.

Then, square that:

1.004680465^2.

= (1 + 0.004680465 )^2.

= 1 + 2*0.004680465 + (0.004680465)^2.

= 1 + 0.00936093 + 0.000021908.

= 1.009382838.

So (1.0023375)^4 = approximately 1.009382838.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009382838 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm. So this suggests that the correct factor is approximately 2.27, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, which is the closest higher option.

But why would the calculation lead to 2.27? Maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the radial velocity given is the star's actual velocity, so the Doppler shift is more significant. Wait, 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light. So the Doppler shift effect is small, but not negligible when computing luminosity.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, the Doppler shift is being applied to the observed flux, which would affect the calculated luminosity.

Wait, but luminosity is an intrinsic property, so I don't think so.

An alternative approach: Perhaps the problem considers the luminosity as observed, which would be affected by the Doppler shift.

But observed luminosity isn't a standard term; luminosity is intrinsic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about flux, but the question says luminosity.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to calculate the ratio based only on radius, ignoring the Doppler effect, leading to 2.25, option A.

But that would ignore the Doppler effect, which the problem statement seems to imply is relevant because they mention the observed λ_max.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the problem is considering the Doppler shift to calculate the actual temperature, and the radius is 1.5 times, leading to the L ratio (1.5)^2 * (1.0023375)^4 = 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.271.

But since the options don't include this, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, which is approximately 2.27 rounded up.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to compute (1.5)^2 times (1 + 4*0.0023375), but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to compute the Doppler shift using the non-relativistic formula, which is λ_obs = λ_rest (1 + v/c), but that would be incorrect.

Wait, let me try that approach.

Using the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards us:

λ_obs = λ_rest (1 - v/c).

So, for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 - 0.0023375 ) = λ2_rest * 0.9976625.

Since Star_1's λ1_obs = λ1_rest, and λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 0.9976625.

Using Wien's law, T1 = b / λ1_rest = b / (0.9976625 λ2_rest ) = (b / λ2_rest ) * (1/0.9976625 ) = T2 * 1.0023375.

Thus, T1 = T2 * 1.0023375.

Thus, (T1/T2)^4 = (1.0023375)^4 ≈ 1.00938.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.271.

Same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, but I can't reconcile the calculation with that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the observed flux is Doppler shifted, which affects the calculation of luminosity.

Flux F = L / (4π d²).

But observed flux F_obs = F * (1 + v/c ), when the source is moving towards us.

So, observed F_obs = (L / (4π d² )) * (1 + v/c ).

But since the problem is about intrinsic luminosity, L is the same regardless of distance or Doppler shift. So perhaps the problem is not considering this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistakenly considering the observed flux when calculating luminosity, which would lead to a different result.

But no, the question says they computed the luminosity of the stars, which is an intrinsic property.

So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is option B) ~2.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct factor is 2.32.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 more accurately.

β = 0.0023375.

(1 + β) = 1.0023375.

(1 - β) = 0.9976625.

(1.0023375)/(0.9976625) = 1.004667.

(1.004667)^2 = ?

Let me compute it more precisely.

1.004667 * 1.004667.

Break it down:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.004667 = 0.004667.

0.004667 * 1 = 0.004667.

0.004667 * 0.004667 ≈ 0.000021778.

Sum:

1 + 0.004667 + 0.004667 + 0.000021778 = 1 + 0.009334 + 0.000021778 = 1.009355778.

Thus, [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 ≈ 1.009355778.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009355778 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm. No change.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The calculation consistently gives approximately 2.27, which isn't one of the options. But perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, which is the next higher option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use only the radius ratio, leading to 2.25 (option A), but that ignores the Doppler effect which the problem seems to imply is relevant.

In conclusion, the calculation points to a factor of approximately 2.27, but since that's not an option, I'll have to choose the closest one, which is option B) ~2.32.


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, given that they radiate as blackbodies, have the same observed peak wavelength (λ_max), and different radial velocities. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Observed λ_max and Temperature Relation**:  
   The observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Using Wien's law, the temperature of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its peak wavelength:  
   \[
   T = \frac{b}{\lambda_{\text{max}}}
   \]  
   Since the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, their observed temperatures are equal. However, the rest-frame temperatures differ due to the Doppler effect caused by their radial velocities.

2. **Doppler Shift and Rest-Frame Temperatures**:  
   Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), while Star_1 is at rest (\( v = 0 \, \text{km/s} \)). The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}, \quad \text{where } \beta = \frac{v}{c}.
   \]  
   For Star_2, the observed wavelength is blueshifted due to its motion toward the observer. The rest-frame wavelength of Star_2 is related to its observed wavelength by:  
   \[
   \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}.
   \]  
   Using this relationship, the rest-frame temperature of Star_2 is lower than its observed temperature.

3. **Luminosity Formula**:  
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4.
   \]  
   The luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2 is:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
   \]  
   Given \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), the radius factor is \( \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25 \). The temperature ratio depends on the Doppler shift.

4. **Temperature Ratio and Luminosity Calculation**:  
   From the Doppler shift, the rest-frame temperature ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \beta = \frac{700}{299792} \approx 0.0023375 \):  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \sqrt{\frac{1.0023375}{0.9976625}} \approx 1.00233.
   \]  
   Raising this to the fourth power:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (1.00233)^4 \approx 1.00938.
   \]  
   Combining with the radius factor:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 1.00938 \approx 2.271.
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately \( 2.27 \), but this value does not match any of the provided options exactly. The closest option is \( \mathbf{B) \, \sim 2.32} \), which is slightly higher than the computed value. The discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.
