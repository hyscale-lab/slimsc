--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons. Wait, but if it's Li-6, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number of 6.

So I need to find the total energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Relativistic energy, yeah. I remember the formula for relativistic energy is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

The formula for gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Let me write that down:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Given that v is 0.96c, so let's compute gamma.

First, compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 equals 0.0784. Then the square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let me calculate that more accurately. Let me see: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857 approximately.

Now, the energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is m c squared. So I need to find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, the nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.6605e-27 kg. The mass of Li-6 is 6 u. So m = 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 9.963e-27 kg.

But wait, another approach is to compute the rest mass energy in electron volts (since the options are in GeV). Oh right, because 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. So the rest mass energy is 5.589 GeV.

But wait, do I need to be more precise with the value of u? Because the problem says the precision is at 1e-4. So perhaps I should use a more accurate value for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, let me double-check the exact mass. Alternatively, maybe the mass is the atomic mass including electrons? No, in a nucleus, the electrons are part of the atom, but when considering the nucleus alone, the electrons are not included. So the mass of the Li nucleus is 6 u, but wait, no. Wait, lithium has atomic number 3, so the neutral atom has 3 electrons. But the nucleus is Li-6, so it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so the mass is 6 u minus the electrons' mass? No, when dealing with heavy ions like in colliders, the mass is considered as the mass of the nucleus, which is A u, where A is the mass number.

Wait, but wait. The mass of the nucleus is approximately A u, but in reality, due to binding energy, it's slightly less. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can approximate it as 6 u. Because the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6.

So then, the rest mass energy is 6 u converted into GeV. Let me compute that precisely.

1 u = 931.494 MeV/c². So 6 u = 6 * 931.494 MeV = 5588.964 MeV, which is 5.588964 GeV.

So m c² is 5.588964 GeV.

Then the total energy is gamma multiplied by that. Gamma is 3.57142857, so let's compute 5.588964 * 3.57142857.

Let me calculate that step by step.

5.588964 * 3.57142857.

First, perhaps approximate:

3.57142857 is about 3.5714. Let's compute 5.588964 * 3.5714.

Let's break it down:

5 * 3.5714 is 17.857
0.588964 *3.5714 ≈ let's compute 0.5 *3.5714=1.7857 and 0.088964 *3.5714 ≈ about 0.316.

So 1.7857 + 0.316 = 2.1017.

Then total is 17.857 + 2.1017 = 19.9587 GeV.

Wait, but that's an approximate calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps multiply 5.588964 * 3.57142857.

Hmm, let me compute it accurately.

3.57142857 is equal to 25/7. Because 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 5.588964 * (25/7) = (5.588964 *25)/7.

Compute 5.588964 *25: 5 *25=125, 0.588964 *25=14.7241. So total is 125 +14.7241 = 139.7241.

Divide by 7: 139.7241 /7 = approximately 19.9605857 GeV.

Hmm, so about 19.96 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Wait, my approximate calculation is about 19.96 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132 GeV) or option D is 21.419, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the gamma calculation.

Wait, v is 0.96c. So beta is 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So that part is correct. Then the rest mass energy is 5.588964 GeV.

So 5.588964 * 3.57142857 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise computation.

Let me compute 5.588964 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

5 * 3.57142857 = 17.85714285

0.588964 *3.57142857 = ?

0.5 *3.57142857 = 1.785714285

0.08 *3.57142857 = 0.2857142856

0.008964 *3.57142857 ≈ let's calculate:

0.008 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.02857142856

0.000964 *3.57142857 ≈ approximately 0.003443.

So adding up:

1.785714285 + 0.2857142856 = 2.07142857

Plus 0.02857142856 is 2.099999998

Plus 0.003443 is approximately 2.103443.

So the total would be:

17.85714285 + 2.103443 ≈ 19.96058585 GeV.

Hmm, so approx 19.96 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C: 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.17 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me double-check. Because I used 6 u, but perhaps the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less due to binding energy?

Wait, another approach: The exact rest mass of Li-6 might be slightly less than 6u. For example, the atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.014102 atomic mass units. Hmm, wait, wait, I think I should check the exact mass.

Wait, the standard atomic weight of lithium-6 is about 6.014102 u. So perhaps the nucleus is slightly less than 6u because the electrons' mass is not included, but wait, no. Wait, the nucleus's mass is approximately the sum of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, which is usually about 0.931 MeV per nucleon, but that's for the binding energy per nucleon. Wait, but that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.014102 u? No, wait, that's the atomic mass, which includes the electrons. So if we're considering the nucleus, we have to subtract the mass of the electrons.

Wait, that's an important point. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.014102 u, and the neutral atom has 3 electrons. So the mass of the electrons is 3 * (mass of electron) = 3 * 0.00054858 u (since 1 u is about 1.66e-27 kg, but the electron mass is about 0.00054858 u).

So the nucleus mass is 6.014102 u - 3*(0.00054858 u) = 6.014102 - 0.00164574 = approximately 6.01245626 u.

So the rest mass of the nucleus is 6.01245626 u.

Wait, but that's the atomic mass, so perhaps I should use the exact value.

So then, the rest mass energy is 6.01245626 u * 931.494 MeV/u.

Let's calculate that.

6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.01245626 u *931.494 MeV/u = approx 0.01245626 *931.494 ≈ let's compute:

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494

0.00245626 *931.494 ≈ 2.288.

So total: approx 9.31494 + 2.288 ≈11.6029 MeV, which is 0.0116029 GeV.

So total rest mass energy is 5.588964 +0.0116029 =5.6005669 GeV.

Wait, that's a significant change. So earlier I used 5.588964 GeV, but the actual rest mass is about 5.6 GeV.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, let's compute it accurately.

The exact rest mass energy is (6.01245626 u) * 931.494 MeV/u.

6.01245626 * 931.494 = ?

6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.01245626 *931.494 = ?

0.01 *931.494 = 9.31494

0.00245626 *931.494 ≈ 0.00245626 *900 = 2.2106, and 0.00245626 *31.494 ≈ 0.0773. So total is 2.2106 +0.0773 ≈2.2879.

So summing up: 5588.964 +9.31494 +2.2879 ≈5588.964 +11.60284=559, (5588.964 +11.60284)=5600.56684 MeV.

Which is 5.60056684 GeV.

So now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So total energy E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.60056684 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.60056684 =16.80170052

0.57142857 *5.60056684 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.5 *5.60056684 =2.80028342

0.07142857 *5.60056684 ≈ approx 0.07142857 *5 =0.35714285, and 0.07142857 *0.60056684≈0.042916. So total ≈0.35714285 +0.042916≈0.399.

So 0.57142857 *5.60056684 ≈2.80028342 +0.399=3.19928342.

So total E ≈16.8017 +3.19928342 ≈19.99998 ≈20 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20 GeV.

But looking at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So 20 GeV is not exactly listed, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps my calculation was a bit off because I approximated some steps. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma and the rest mass.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

Rest mass in GeV is 5.60056684 GeV.

So E = 3.5714285714 *5.60056684.

Let me compute this product precisely.

3.5714285714 ×5.60056684.

Break it down:

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.60056684.

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 ×0.00056684 ≈approx 0.002022.

So 2.14285714284 + 0.002022 ≈2.144879.

So total E = 17.857142857 +2.144879 ≈19.9990218 GeV.

Hmm, about 20 GeV.

But the options are precise to four decimal places. So perhaps my calculation is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should use more accurate values for the mass.

Wait, the exact value of the Li-6 nucleus's mass is 6.01245626 u.

So 6.01245626 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute it:

6.01245626 ×931.494 = ?

Let me compute this step by step.

6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.01245626 *931.494 = ?

Compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494 MeV.

0.00245626 *931.494 = let's compute 0.002 *931.494=1.862988 and 0.00045626 *931.494≈0.4245.

So total is 1.862988 +0.4245 ≈2.2875.

So sum: 9.31494 +2.2875 =11.60244 MeV.

So total is 5588.964 +11.60244 =5600.56644 MeV =5.60056644 GeV.

So m c² is 5.60056644 GeV.

Now, compute E = gamma * m c².

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 3.5714285714 *5.60056644 = ?

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

Multiply 3.5714285714 ×5.60056644.

Using a calculator:

3.5714285714 ×5.60056644 ≈20.001 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.00 GeV. But none of the options is 20.00 exactly. The closest is option C which is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me try another approach. Maybe the mass is m = 6 u, which is 5.588964 GeV, and gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.588964 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.588964.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.588964.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.5 =1.785714285.

3.57142857 ×0.088964 = let's compute:

0.08 ×3.57142857=0.2857142856.

0.008964 ×3.57142857≈0.03192.

So 0.2857142856 +0.03192 = 0.3176342856.

So 1.785714285 +0.3176342856 =2.10334857.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.10334857=19.96049142 GeV.

So about 19.96 GeV.

Hmm, that's still around 19.96 GeV. But none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, perhaps the mistake comes from assuming the nucleus's mass is 6u. Maybe I should use the precise mass of Li-6, including the electrons?

Wait, no. Wait, in particle physics, when dealing with ions, the mass is usually taken as the atomic mass (including electrons) because the ion has the same number of electrons as protons. But in this case, when the nucleus is moving in the collider, the electrons are separate, so the mass considered is just the nucleus's mass. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the correct approach is to use the rest mass of the nucleus, which is not exactly 6u because of binding energy. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01245626 u, as I computed earlier. So the rest mass energy is 5.600566 GeV.

So, then, E = 3.57142857 ×5.600566 GeV.

Let me calculate that precisely.

5.600566 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.600566 *3.57142857.

Using a calculator:

It's easier to use a more precise calculation.

Well, 3.57142857 is exactly 25/7.

So 5.600566 * (25/7) = (5.600566 *25)/7.

5.600566 ×25 = 140.01415.

Divide by 7: 140.01415 /7 = 20.00202143 GeV.

So approximately 20.002 GeV.

The options don't have that. So the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but that's 0.13 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps I should check my calculation again. Did I make a mistake in the mass?

Wait, another approach: the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01245626 u. So that's 6.01245626 × 931.494 MeV/u.

Wait, 6.01245626 ×931.494 = ?

Let me compute:

6 × 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.01245626 ×931.494 = let's compute 0.01 ×931.494 =9.31494, 0.00245626 ×931.494 = approx 2.2874 MeV.

So 9.31494 +2.2874=11.60234 MeV.

Total is 5588.964 +11.60234=5600.56634 MeV =5.60056634 GeV.

So that part's correct.

So E=5.60056634 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.60056634 ×3.57142857.

Compute 5 ×3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.60056634 ×3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.00056634 ×3.57142857≈0.002022.

So total 2.142857142 +0.002022=2.144879142.

So E=17.85714285 +2.144879142=19.99902199 GeV.

Hmm, about 20 GeV.

But the options don't have 20. So perhaps the correct answer is option C (20.132 GeV), but why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

Wait, perhaps more decimal places are needed in gamma.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator for gamma.

Compute 1 - (0.96)^2 =1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise values for the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me check.

Looking up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus: I think it's about 6.01245626 u, as I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps the initial approximation of using 6 u is giving me 19.96 GeV, but using the exact mass gives me about 20.00 GeV, which is still not matching any of the options.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recheck.

v=0.96c, so beta is 0.96. Then gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options due to a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another possibility: the problem asks for the energy of the RHIC, which is a collider. So perhaps the energy per nucleon or per ion is considered, but I think the problem states the nucleus itself.

Wait, but perhaps the mass is per nucleon. No, the nucleus is Li-6, so the mass is 6 nucleons.

Wait, another thought: maybe the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider", which typically refers to the total energy, including rest mass.

Wait, but the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So it's the total energy of the nucleus.

I'm a bit stuck here. So according to my calculations, the energy should be around 20 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rest mass energy.

Wait, 6.01245626 u ×931.494 MeV/u = 6.01245626 ×931.494 = Let me compute this precisely.

6.01245626 ×931.494:

Compute 6 ×931.494 =5588.964.

0.01245626 ×931.494 = let's compute this exactly.

0.01 ×931.494 =9.31494.

0.00245626 ×931.494 = compute 0.002 ×931.494=1.862988, and 0.00045626 ×931.494≈0.4245.

So 1.862988 +0.4245=2.287488.

So 9.31494 +2.287488=11.602428 MeV.

Adding to 5588.964 MeV: 5588.964 +11.602428=5600.566428 MeV=5.600566428 GeV.

So that part is correct.

So gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 5.600566428 ×3.5714285714.

Let me compute this exactly.

5.600566428 ×3.5714285714.

Let me break it down:

5 ×3.5714285714 =17.857142857.

0.600566428 ×3.5714285714.

Compute 0.6 ×3.5714285714=2.14285714284.

0.000566428 ×3.5714285714 ≈0.002022.

So total for 0.600566428 ×3.5714285714 is approximately 2.14285714284 +0.002022=2.14487914284.

Adding to 17.857142857: 17.857142857 +2.14487914284=19.999022 GeV.

Hmm, about 20 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the answer is supposed to be option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But according to my calculations, it's 19.999, which is about 20 GeV.

But perhaps I should recheck the initial steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mass is not 6 u but the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.014102 u (atomic mass) and because the electrons contribute to the mass, the total mass considered is the atomic mass. Because in the collider, the ions are charged, so they include electrons.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because in a nucleus, the electrons are not part of the nucleus; the nucleus is the protons and neutrons. So the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

But perhaps the problem is considering the mass of the entire ion, including electrons.

Wait, wait, wait. If the ion is Li^6 with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, and for the ion, the number of electrons depends on the charge. But in this case, since it's a nucleus, perhaps it's a bare nucleus, meaning it has no electrons. So the mass is the mass of the nucleus, which is 6.01245626 u.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using just 6 u without worrying about the precise binding energy. So for 6 u, the rest mass is 5.588964 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.588964=?

Let me compute 5.588964 ×3.57142857.

5.588964 ×3 =16.766892.

5.588964 ×0.57142857.

Compute 5.588964 ×0.5=2.794482.

5.588964 ×0.07142857≈0.4008.

So total 2.794482 +0.4008=3.195282.

So E=16.766892 +3.195282=19.962174 GeV.

So about 19.962 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is C) 20.132 GeV, but why the discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact values without any approximations.

Let me compute gamma exactly.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714285714.

Rest mass energy: 5.600566428 GeV.

E = 3.5714285714285714 ×5.600566428 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

3.5714285714285714 ×5.600566428.

Break it down:

3.5714285714285714 ×5 =17.857142857142857.

3.5714285714285714 ×0.600566428.

Compute 3.5714285714285714 ×0.6 =2.1428571428571428.

3.5714285714285714 ×0.000566428 ≈0.002022.

So total for 0.600566428: 2.1428571428571428 +0.002022=2.1448791428571428.

Adding to the 17.857142857142857:
