Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, so the wave function is psi(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, wave functions usually are complex, right? The square of the absolute value gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |psi|^2 dx over that region.

Given that all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Oh wait, but the way it's phrased: when measuring, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3, which implies that the wave function has zero probability outside this range. So the wave function must be such that |psi|^2 is zero for x <1 and x>3. 

But wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square is |psi|^2 = [ (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because the imaginary part is -0.5i. So |psi|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But if the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, the probability outside this region should be zero. So for x <1 and x>3, |psi|^2 must be zero. Wait, but looking at the expression for |psi|^2, it's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. For this to be zero, each term would have to be zero, but 0.25 is a positive number, so that can't be. Hmm, that suggests I might have misunderstood the setup.

Wait no, maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside that interval, but the given form is just for the part where it's non-zero. That would make sense. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and has the given form in between.

Wait, but the given function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex function, but for the region x <1 and x>3, the wave function should be zero. So perhaps this function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But then the question says each particle can move along the tube, but when measured, none were found outside 1 and 3. So the wave function is zero outside [1,3].

Wait, but the given wave function is a/(sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So when x is 1, sqrt(2) is in the denominator, etc. So perhaps in the region x=1 to x=3, the wave function is as given. So the wave function is zero outside this interval.

But given that, the square of the absolute value would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. But if the wave function is zero outside [1,3], then the integral of |psi|^2 dx from -infinity to infinity should be 1, as it's a probability distribution.

Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside [1,3], then the integral from 1 to 3 of |psi(x)|^2 dx should equal 1. So I can set up the integral of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 equal to 1.

But wait, wait a second. If the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2], right? But that would imply that |psi|^2 is not zero outside [1,3], unless the wave function is zero outside. So perhaps the wave function is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 <= x <=3, and zero otherwise.

So then the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but if that's the case, I can compute the integral as the sum of two terms: integral of a^2/(1+x) dx plus integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

The first integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

∫1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25 * (3-1) )= 0.25 *2= 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Let me compute ln(2) ≈0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the absolute square is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So that's correct.

Wait, but is the wave function correctly given? Because usually, wave functions are normalized, but maybe the presence of the imaginary part complicates things. But in this problem, the wave function is such that the modulus squared is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

Yes, because for a complex number, |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². So in this case, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |psi|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the calculations I did should be correct.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particles are only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function must be normalized over this interval. The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]  
   So, the first term becomes:  
   \[
   a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining the results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):  
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \implies a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):  
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:  
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
