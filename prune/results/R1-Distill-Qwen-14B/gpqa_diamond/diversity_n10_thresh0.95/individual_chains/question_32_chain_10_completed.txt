--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is X, which is lithium with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, lithium with 3 neutrons. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it's Li-6 maybe? Because Li normally has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6, which is a stable isotope. So the mass number is 6, so its mass would be about 6 atomic mass units.

But wait, I need to find the energy of the nucleus in the collider. So, I think this is a relativistic mechanics problem because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c). So I'll probably need to use the gamma factor.

The formula I remember is that the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) multiplied by the rest mass energy. But wait, wait, the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass. But the question is about the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the kinetic energy each ion has. Or maybe it's the total energy? I need to be careful here.

Wait, the problem says "energy of the RHIC". I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is typically the kinetic energy. Alternatively, sometimes total energy is given, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the total energy, but I should probably proceed with the kinetic energy approach.

So first, compute gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given v is 0.96c, so let's compute that.

v = 0.96c
v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c²
So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, so yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so the mass is 6 atomic mass units (u). But I need to convert that into kilograms or into electron volts. Since the options are in GeV, I should convert into energy units.

The atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. But another approach is to use the conversion factor where 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². Because 1 u when converted to energy via E=mc² is about 931.5 MeV.

So, mass of Li-6: 6 u. So rest mass energy is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the rest mass energy m c² is 5.589 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m c². Alternatively, the total energy is gamma * m c². But I need to clarify what the question is asking for. The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c". So I think RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain kinetic energy, but sometimes colliders give the total energy. Wait, no, in high-energy physics, the beam energy is usually the kinetic energy per particle. Or is it the total energy (including rest mass)?

Wait, wait. Let me think. The RHIC collides heavy ions, so each beam has a certain energy. The energy given is typically the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps I should proceed with calculating the total energy, because the given speed would relate to the total energy.

Wait, but in particle physics, when talking about the energy of a particle in a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy. Or perhaps it's the total energy. I think I might have to check this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy. Wait, the problem states "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So the speed relates to the kinetic energy, but wait, actually, the speed is determined by the total energy and the mass.

Wait, the formula for speed in terms of gamma is v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Alternatively, v = c * (p c^2)/(E), where E is the total energy and p is the momentum. But perhaps the simplest way is to compute gamma and then find the energy.

So, gamma is about 3.5714. The rest mass energy is 5.589 GeV.

So the total energy E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

3.5714 * 5.589.

Hmm, 3 *5.589 is 16.767. 0.5714 *5.589 is approximately 3.198 (since 0.5 *5.589 is 2.7945, 0.0714 is about 0.400, so sum is about 3.194). So total is 16.767 + 3.194 = ~19.961 GeV. Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, more accurately: 3.5714 *5.589.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.589 = let's compute:

3.5714 *0.5 = 1.7857

3.5714 *0.08 = 0.285712

3.5714 *0.009 = 0.0321426

Adding those together: 1.7857 + 0.285712 = 2.071412; plus 0.0321426 gives 2.1035546.

So total is 17.857 + 2.1035546 = 19.9605546 GeV. Approximately 19.96 GeV.

Wait, but the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So 19.96 is not exactly one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I was supposed to use the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let's see. The kinetic energy is (gamma-1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.5714, so gamma-1 = 2.5714. Multiply by 5.589 GeV.

2.5714 *5.589.

Let me compute that: 2 *5.589 is 11.178. 0.5714 *5.589.

0.5 *5.589 is 2.7945.

0.0714 *5.589 is about 0.400.

So 2.7945 + 0.400 = 3.1945.

So total is 11.178 + 3.1945 = 14.3725 GeV.

But that's about 14.37 GeV, which isn't one of the options. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the total energy, not the kinetic energy. So my initial calculation gave about 19.96 GeV, but that's not one of the options. Looking at the options, the closest is C) 20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma. Let me recheck the value of gamma.

v = 0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c^2.

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more precisely.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that accurately.

3.57142857 * 5.589.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.589.

Wait, 5.589 is 5 + 0.5 + 0.08 + 0.009. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute as 3.57142857 *5.589.

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5 = 17.85714285

The 0.589 part: 3.57142857 *0.5 = 1.785714285

3.57142857 *0.08 = 0.2857142856

3.57142857 *0.009 = 0.03214285713

Adding these: 1.785714285 + 0.2857142856 = 2.071428571 + 0.03214285713 = 2.103571428.

So total is 17.85714285 + 2.103571428 = 19.96071428 GeV.

So approximately 19.9607 GeV. None of the options match exactly, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Because X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6, but the mass I used is 6 u. Let me double-check that.

Yes, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so mass number 6. So the mass is 6 u. So rest energy is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the exact value of the atomic mass unit. Sometimes, in precise calculations, we might use more accurate values, but I think 931.5 MeV/u is standard, so 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

Wait, what if the speed was given but the question is about the kinetic energy? Let me compute that.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1 = 2.57142857.

Multiply by 5.589 GeV: 2.57142857 *5.589.

Let's compute 2.57142857 *5.589.

2 *5.589 = 11.178.

0.57142857 *5.589.

Compute 0.5 *5.589 =2.7945.

0.07142857 *5.589: Let's compute 5.589 *0.07 = 0.39123, 5.589 *0.00142857 is approximately 0.007985.

So total 0.39123 +0.007985 ≈ 0.399215.

So 0.57142857 *5.589 ≈2.7945 +0.399215 =3.193715.

So total K ≈11.178 +3.193715 =14.371715 GeV ≈14.37 GeV.

But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the total energy, but my calculation of 19.96 GeV isn't exactly one of the options. The closest is option C) 20.132 GeV. Maybe I made an error in the rest mass energy.

Wait, let me recheck the rest mass calculation. Li-6's mass is 6 u. But wait, the exact mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is not exactly 6 u because the binding energy of the nucleus is considered. Wait, but in atomic mass units, the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But if I use the atomic mass unit as approximately 1.66e-27 kg, but in terms of energy, sometimes the exact value for m c^2 may vary slightly.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is slightly less than 6 u. Because when you form a nucleus, mass defect occurs. So maybe the actual rest mass is a bit less than 6 u. Let me find the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I don't have the exact value, but perhaps I can look it up. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use 6 u, so I'll proceed with that.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider relativistic energy correctly. Let me re-express the problem.

The speed is 0.96c, so we can find gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 ≈3.5714.

The rest mass energy is m c² = 5.589 GeV.

The total energy is E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.589 = approx 19.96 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So I'm confused. Let me see the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a little higher than my calculation of 19.96 GeV. Hmm, could there be a miscalculation in the gamma?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2 =1-0.9216=0.0784.

Then sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857 exactly.

Hmm, so perhaps the calculation is correct. So why isn't 19.96 GeV close to any option?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rest energy as 6u, but using a more precise value for u. Let me compute it.

The exact value of 1 u in GeV is approximately 931.494064 MeV, which is 0.931494064 GeV. So 6 u would be 6 * 0.931494064 =5.58896438 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.58896438.

Let me compute that:

3.57142857 *5.58896438.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.58896438.

Compute 0.58896438 = 0.5 +0.08 +0.00896438.

3.57142857 *0.5 =1.785714285

3.57142857 *0.08 =0.2857142856

3.57142857 *0.00896438 ≈ let me compute:

3.57142857 *0.008 = 0.02857142856

3.57142857 *0.00096438 ≈ approximately 0.003443.

So 0.0285714 +0.003443 ≈0.032014.

Adding the three parts:1.785714285 +0.2857142856 =2.071428571 +0.032014=2.103442571.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.103442571=19.96058542 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.9606 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.17 GeV higher.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy, but that would give around 14.37 GeV, which isn't an option either.

Wait, what if the calculation uses a different approach. Let's think about the relation between energy and speed.

The relativistic energy is E = gamma m c², and momentum p = gamma m v.

Alternatively, we can use E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Wait, but since we know v, we can find gamma, and thus find E.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but that's not indicated.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let me try that.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c^2. So with gamma=3.5714, K= (2.5714) *5.58896438.

2.5714 *5.58896438.

2*5.58896438 =11.17792876.

0.5714 *5.58896438. Let's compute that.

0.5 *5.58896438 =2.79448219.

0.0714 *5.58896438 ≈0.400502 (since 5.58896438 *0.07=0.3912275, and 0.0014 *5.58896≈0.0078245, so total 0.3990515.)

So 2.79448219 +0.3990515 ≈3.1935337.

Total K=11.17792876 +3.1935337 ≈14.37146246 GeV.

Again, not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should check if I mixed up the mass.

Wait, wait! The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, wait, Li normally has 3 protons. So if X has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons)=6. So it's Li-6.

But wait, maybe the mass is not 6 u? Because the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than 6 u due to the binding energy. But the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons, so we have to take it as 6 u, right? Because the exact mass would require looking up the precise isotope mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass more precisely. The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus in u is approximately 5.98948 u. Wait, is that correct? Let me recall, the atomic weight of Li-6 is about 6.941 atomic mass units, but that's the atomic weight including electrons. Wait, no, the atomic mass is the mass of the atom, which includes electrons.

Wait, but the nucleus is just protons and neutrons. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 6.941 u minus the mass of the electrons. A neutral Li atom has 3 electrons. The mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u. So three electrons would be about 0.0016457 u. So the nucleus mass would be approximately 6.941 -0.0016457 ≈6.93935 u?

Wait, no. Wait, no, that's not right. Atomic mass units are for the atom, not the nucleus. So to get the nucleus mass, we need the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons plus the binding energy (mass defect).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the mass of the nucleus as approximately 6 u, but perhaps the exact value is 6.941 u minus 3 electrons' mass. Wait, no, that can't be right because the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.941 u, which includes the nucleus plus the electrons. So the nucleus mass is approximately 6.941 u minus (3 * electron mass). Since each electron is about 0.00054858 u, so 3 electrons are about 0.00164574 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.941 -0.00164574 ≈6.939354 u.

Wait, but that can't be because 6 protons and 6 neutrons would have a mass of 12 u if all were free, but in reality, the nucleus has a mass less than that due to binding energy. Wait, no, wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. So their combined rest mass is 6 u. But the actual nucleus is lighter due to the mass defect. So the correct mass is less than 6 u.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the exact mass of Li-6 nucleus in atomic mass units.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use 6 u, and the options are approximations.

In any case, let's consider that the mass is 6 u, and that the calculation gives about 19.96 GeV. Since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, wait: Maybe I should compute gamma more accurately, not just using 0.28 as the square root.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) more accurately. Because 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.571428571.

So E =3.571428571 *5.58896438 GeV.

Wait, let me compute this multiplication accurately.

3.571428571 *5.58896438.

Breaking it down:

3.571428571 *5 =17.857142855

3.571428571 *0.58896438.

Let me compute 3.571428571 *0.5 =1.7857142855

3.571428571 *0.08 =0.28571428568

3.571428571 *0.00896438.

Compute 0.00896438 *3.571428571.

3.571428571 *0.008 =0.02857142857

3.571428571 *0.00096438 ≈0.00344348.

So 0.02857142857 +0.00344348=0.03201490857.

Adding up the three parts:

1.7857142855 +0.28571428568 =2.0714285712 +0.03201490857=2.1034434798.

So total E =17.857142855 +2.1034434798 =19.96058633 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.960586 GeV.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the kinetic energy per nucleon? Because Li-6 has 6 nucleons. So the total energy would be per nucleon times 6. No, that doesn't make sense because RHIC accelerates entire nuclei, not individual nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in selecting the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the total energy E is gamma * m c². So E = gamma * m c².

We have v =0.96c.

We can compute gamma using v = (pc²)/(E), but perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the momentum p.

p = gamma m v.

But without knowing p, maybe it's not helpful.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula. But at 0.96c, that's definitely relativistic, so that's not the case.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 20.132 GeV, considering some rounding or more precise calculation steps. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should not approximate gamma but compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma again with more precise steps.

v= 0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 - v²/c²= 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

Thus, gamma = 1/0.28 =3.571428571.

So m c²=6 u *931.494 MeV/u=5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.571428571 *5.588964 GeV.

Calculating 3.571428571 *5.588964.

Let me compute it step by step.

3 *5.588964 =16.766892.

0.571428571 *5.588964.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.588964=2.794482.

0.071428571 *5.588964.

Compute 5.588964 *0.07 =0.39122748.

5.588964 * 0.001428571 ≈ approximately 0.0079942.

So 0.39122748 +0.0079942 ≈0.39922168.

So 0.571428571 *5.588964 ≈2.794482 +0.39922168 ≈3.19370368.

So total E=16.766892 +3.19370368=19.96059568 GeV.

Hmm, that's 19.96059568 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but it's about 0.17 GeV higher. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate using gamma=3.58 instead of 3.5714. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let's compute 1/sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784e-4.

sqrt(784e-4) =sqrt(784)*1e-2=28*0.01=0.28. So it's exact. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is more accurately 6 *931.494 MeV =5588.964 MeV =5.588964 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.588964 = ?

Let me multiply 3.57142857 by 5.588964.

3.57142857 *5.588964.

Another approach: 3.57142857 ≈ 25/7 (since 25/7=3.57142857).

So 25/7 *5.588964 = (25 *5.588964)/7.

25 *5.588964 = 139.7241.

139.7241 /7=19.9605857 GeV.

So E=19.9605857 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the m c² calculation. Let me compute 6 *931.494 MeV.

6 * 931.494 =5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the speed is given as 0.96c, and that the calculation requires more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the speed is exactly 0.96c, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.588964=19.9605857 GeV.

But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the kinetic energy per nucleon, but that doesn't make sense because the entire nucleus is being accelerated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of neutrons, but the problem says 3.

Wait, another thought: maybe the nucleus is actually deuterium or something else, but no, the problem states it's Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that RHIC accelerates heavy ions, and that the energy given is per ion, but perhaps the question is considering per nucleon.

Wait, but that would make the energy per nucleon, and since Li-6 has 6 nucleons, the total energy would be 6 times per nucleon energy. But that's not the usual way it's calculated. Let me compute that.

If the energy per nucleon is E_nucleon, then total energy E_total =6 * E_nucleon.

Hmm, but I don't think that's the case. RHIC typically accelerates entire nuclei, so the energy is per nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me compute 6 u in GeV/c².

1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² =0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6 u =6 * 0.931494 GeV/c²=5.588964 GeV/c².

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.588964 GeV=19.96058 GeV.

Hmm, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use the relativistic energy formula E = m c² / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is the same as gamma m c².

Which is what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using the exact formula.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The only option close to 19.96 GeV is option C)20.132 GeV. But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is not 6 u. Let me double-check. If the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 6 (3 protons +3 neutrons). But the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus in u is about 5.9895 u, not 6 u.

Ah! That's probably where I went wrong. I assumed the nucleus mass was 6 u, but the actual mass is slightly less due to the binding energy.

So the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 5.9895 u.

So m c² =5.9895 u *931.494 MeV/u = 5.9895 *931.494 ≈ let me compute that.

Compute 5 *931.494=4657.47 MeV.

0.9895 *931.494 ≈ let's compute:

0.9 *931.494=838.3446

0.08 *931.494=74.51952

0.0095 *931.494≈8.849198.

Adding them up: 838.3446 +74.51952=912.86412 +8.849198=921.713318.

So total m c² is 4657.47 +921.713318 =5579.183318 MeV ≈5.579183 GeV.

So now, gamma is 3.57142857.

E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.579183 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.579183 =16.737549.

0.57142857 *5.579183.

Compute 0.5 *5.579183=2.7895915.

0.07142857*5.579183 ≈0.400474.

So total 2.7895915 +0.400474=3.1900655.

So E =16.737549 +3.1900655=19.9276145 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.9276 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for Li-6's mass.

Li-6's exact mass is about 5.98948 u.

So m c² =5.98948 *931.494 MeV = ?

Compute 5 *931.494=4657.47 MeV.

0.98948 *931.494 ≈ let me compute:

0.9 *931.494=838.3446

0.08948 *931.494= let's compute:

0.08 *931.494=74.51952

0.00948 *931.494≈8.8474.

So 74.51952 +8.8474=83.36692.

So 0.98948 *931.494=838.3446 +83.36692=921.71152 MeV.

So m c² =4657.47 +921.71152 =5579.18152 MeV ≈5.57918152 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.57918152 = ?

3 *5.57918152=16.73754456.

0.57142857 *5.57918152.

0.5 *5.57918152=2.78959076.

0.07142857 *5.57918152 ≈approx 0.07142857 *5=0.35714285, 0.07142857*0.57918152≈0.04142857.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

0.07142857 *5.57918152 = 0.07142857 *5= 0.35714285 plus 0.07142857 *0.57918152.

0.07142857 *0.57918152 ≈0.04142857.

So total ≈0.35714285 +0.04142857=0.39857142.

So 0.57142857 *5.57918152≈2.78959076 +0.39857142≈3.18816218.

So E=16.73754456 +3.18816218≈19.92570674 GeV.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So none of these are close to 19.9257 GeV. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV. But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy, but that gave about 14.37 GeV, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read again.

The question is about the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c.

Wait, perhaps the energy refers to the kinetic energy, but I've already tried that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rest mass in terms of protons. No, that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the speed.

Wait, 0.96c is exact, but perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise decimal places.

Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps the error comes from the mass.

Wait, maybe the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.941 atomic mass units minus 3 times the electron mass.

Wait, no, because the nucleus doesn't include the electrons. The atom's mass is nucleus plus electrons.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.941 u, which includes 3 electrons.

So the nucleus mass is 6.941 u -3 *electron mass.

Electron mass is 0.0005485799 u.

So 3 electrons: 0.0016457397 u.

So nucleus mass =6.941 -0.0016457397=6.93935426 u.

So m c²=6.93935426 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

6.93935426 *931.494 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.93935426 *931.494= let me compute:

0.9 *931.494=838.3446

0.03935426 *931.494 ≈36.584.

So total for 0.93935426 is 838.3446 +36.584=874.9286.

So m c²=5588.964 +874.9286=6463.8926 MeV=6.4638926 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right. That would imply a much higher energy.

Wait, no, wait, that's incorrect. Because 6.93935426 u is the nucleus mass. So m c²=6.93935426 *931.494 MeV.

So 6.93935426 *931.494 = ?

6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.93935426 *931.494= 874.9286 MeV.

So total m c²=5588.964 +874.9286=6463.8926 MeV=6.4638926 GeV.

Wait, that's way higher than before. But that's because I'm adding 6.93935426 u times 931.494 MeV/u.

Wait, no, wait, that can't be. Because 6.941 u is the atomic mass, including electrons. So if I subtract the electrons' mass, the nucleus mass is 6.941 -3*(0.0005485799) =6.939354 u.

So m c²=6.939354 u *931.494 MeV/u =6.939354 *931.494 ≈6.939354 *900=6245.4186 +6.939354*31.494≈218.365.

So total m c²≈6245.4186 +218.365=6463.7836 MeV≈6.4637836 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 6.4638 GeV.

But earlier I thought the nucleus mass was 5.989 u. That's conflicting with this.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused between the mass of the nucleus and the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.941 u, which includes 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons. The nucleus (protons + neutrons) would have a mass of approximately 6.941 u minus 3*(electron mass).

Electron mass is about 0.00054858 u, so 3 electrons would be 0.00164574 u.

So the nucleus mass is 6.941 -0.00164574=6.93935426 u.

So m c²=6.93935426 u *931.494 MeV/u=6.93935426 *931.494 MeV.

Compute that:

6.93935426 *900 MeV=6245.418834 MeV.

6.93935426 *31.494 MeV≈218.538 MeV.

So total m c²≈6245.418834 +218.538=6463.956834 MeV=6.463956834 GeV.

So that's about 6.463957 GeV.

Now, computing E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *6.463957 GeV.

Compute 3 *6.463957=19.391871.

0.57142857 *6.463957.

Compute 0.5 *6.463957=3.2319785.

0.07142857 *6.463957≈0.461304.

Adding them gives 3.2319785 +0.461304=3.6932825.

So E=19.391871 +3.6932825≈23.0851535 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is very close to this.

Wait, but why? Because I think earlier I was using the nucleus mass as 6 u, which gave E≈19.96 GeV, but considering the correct nucleus mass as 6.939354 u, the E is around 23.08 GeV, which is option B)23.069 GeV.

Wait, but that makes sense because the nucleus mass is higher than I initially thought. Because I thought the nucleus is 6 u, but actually, after accounting for the electrons, it's about 6.939 u.

So with m c²=6.463957 GeV, E=3.57142857 *6.463957≈23.085 GeV.

But option B is 23.069 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but that's assuming the nucleus mass is 6.939 u, which includes the electrons, but that's not correct. Because the nucleus doesn't include the electrons. So perhaps I made a mistake in that calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers only the protons and neutrons, not including electrons, so m=6 u.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. I think the correct approach is to proceed with the initial assumption that the nucleus mass is 6 u, which gives E≈19.96 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the kinetic energy, but that's about 14 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using more precise values for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Given the options, and the problem, the correct answer would be option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not entirely certain.

But I think the problem expects us to calculate the total energy, assuming the mass is 6 u, leading to E=19.96 GeV. Since the closest option is C)20.132, perhaps I should conclude that option C is the intended answer, but I'm not entirely confident.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we proceed as follows:

1. **Key Information**:  
   - The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number \( A = 6 \) (3 protons + 3 neutrons).  
   - The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \).  
   - The rest mass energy of the nucleus is calculated using the atomic mass unit (u), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \).  

2. **Relativistic Energy Formula**:  
   The total energy of the nucleus is given by:  
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

3. **Calculate \( \gamma \)**:  
   - \( v = 0.96c \), so \( v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216 \).  
   - \( 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784 \).  
   - \( \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28 \), so \( \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714 \).

4. **Rest Mass Energy**:  
   - The rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is \( m c^2 = 6 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5588.964 \, \text{MeV} = 5.588964 \, \text{GeV} \).

5. **Total Energy**:  
   - Substituting into the relativistic energy formula:  
     \[
     E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.588964 \, \text{GeV} \approx 19.96 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - The calculated energy \( E \approx 19.96 \, \text{GeV} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.  
   - The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value.  
   - Other options (A: 18.475 GeV, B: 23.069 GeV, D: 21.419 GeV) are significantly farther from the calculated value.

7. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the calculations, the most reasonable choice is **C) 20.132 GeV**, as it is the closest to the computed energy of \( 19.96 \, \text{GeV} \). Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

**Answer: C**
