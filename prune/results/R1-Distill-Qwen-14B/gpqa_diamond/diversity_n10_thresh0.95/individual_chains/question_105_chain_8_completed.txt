Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about starspots and how they affect the brightness of a star. The question is asking about the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

Alright, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so R_star is R_sun. The problem says the spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered, right? So if the hemisphere is 20% covered, then the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. But wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface, so the total area is (π R^2)/2. So the spots cover 0.2 * (π R^2 /2 ) = 0.1 π R^2. Let me note that down.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. So the spot temperature is 5000 K. Because when a star rotates, the spots come into view, causing dips in brightness. The question is about how this brightness variation compares to that of a planet transiting the star.

I remember that the brightness change (the amplitude of the light curve) depends on the area of the spot and the temperature difference. When a spot is on the visible side, it contributes less light because it's cooler. The same goes for a planet transit: when a planet passes in front, it blocks some of the star's light.

Wait, but the star's brightness variation due to spots is different. The formula I recall for the relative brightness change due to a spot is something like (delta F) / F = (A_spot / A_star) * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) * (some factor?), but I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Actually, the variation in brightness when a spot is on the star's surface depends on the area of the spot and the temperature difference. When the star rotates, a spot moves into view. The flux from the star without the spot would be F = sigma * T_eff^4 * (R^2 / D^2), where D is distance. But when a spot is present, the flux from that area is lower.

The total flux without any spots is F_total = sigma * T_eff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / D^2, but that's probably more than I need. Alternatively, the relative flux change when a spot is present is given by the area of the spot multiplied by the relative temperature change. So the fractional change in flux, ΔF/F, is approximately (A_spot / A_star) * ( (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) / T_eff^4 ). Wait, but since the spot is cooler, T_spot is less than T_eff, so the flux from the spot is less than the average, causing a dip.

Wait, no, the formula for the change in flux when a spot is on the visible hemisphere is: 

ΔF = (A_spot / A_star) * (F_spot - F_unspotted)

F_unspotted is sigma*Teff^4, and F_spot is sigma*(T_spot)^4. So ΔF = (A_spot/A_star) * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) * sigma.

But since Teff is higher, T_spot^4 is lower, so ΔF is negative, meaning the total flux decreases.

Wait, but when the spot is on the backside, you don't see any of it, so the flux goes back to normal. So the net effect is a dip when the spot is visible.

Wait, no, the total flux when the spot is on the visible side is F = F_total - A_spot*(T_spot^4 - Teff^4) * sigma?

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the relative change. The fractional change ΔF/F is (delta F) / F = (A_spot / A_star) * ( (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / Teff^4 )

Wait, because the area A_spot contributes (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) times F, so the difference is (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)/Teff^4 per unit area.

So the amplitude of the dip (in terms of fractional change) is:

delta_F_over_F = (A_spot / A_star) * ( T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) / T_eff^4.

Since T_spot is less than Teff, this will be negative, but the amplitude is the absolute value.

Now, the scenario is that the spots are covering one hemisphere, which is 50% of the star's surface, but with a filling factor of 20%, so A_spot is 20% of one hemisphere. So A_spot = 0.2 * (2 pi R^2 ) / 2? Wait, a hemisphere is (2 pi R^2)/2 = pi R^2. So wait, no: the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi R^2. So a hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2.

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2 pi R^2 ) = 0.4 pi R^2.

Wait, but the star's total area is 4 pi R^2, so A_spot / A_star = 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1.

So A_spot/A_star = 0.1.

Now, Teff is 6000 K, T_spot is 5000 K.

So the delta F / F would be 0.1 * (5000^4 - 6000^4) / 6000^4.

Wait, but wait, that would be (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / Teff^4. So the denominator is (6e3)^4.

So let's compute each term:

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 6.25e15.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16.

So (5e3^4 - 6e3^4) is 6.25e15 - 1.296e16 = negative, but we take absolute value for amplitude, so |delta F/F| =0.1 * (1.296e16 - 6.25e15)/1.296e16.

Wait, no. Because Teff is 6e3, and T_spot is 5e3, so T_spot^4 is less, so (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) is negative, so the change is a decrease. So the fractional change is 0.1 * ( (5e3)^4 - (6e3)^4 ) / (6e3)^4.

Which is same as 0.1 * ( (6.25e15) - 1.296e16 ) / 1.296e16.

Wait, 6.25e15 is 0.482253... times 1.296e16, because 1.296e16 is (6e3)^4. Let me compute (5e3)^4 = (5^4)*(1e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14? Wait, wait, no: 1e3^4 is 1e12, 5e3 is 5*1e3, so (5e3)^4= (5^4)*(1e3)^4 )=625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 5000 is 5e3, and 5e3^4 = (5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 625 * (1e12) )= 6.25e14.

Similarly, 6e3^4 = (6^4) * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

So the numerator is (6.25e14 - 1.296e15 ) = (0.625e15 - 1.296e15 ) = -0.671e15.

The denominator is 1.296e15.

So the fractional change is 0.1 * ( -0.671e15 / 1.296e15 ) = 0.1 * ( -0.518 ) ≈ -0.0518. So the magnitude is 0.0518, or about 5.18% decrease.

Wait, but wait, I think I may have messed up the calculation. Let me compute this again.

5000^4 = 5^4 * (1e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

6000^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

So (5000^4 -6000^4) = 6.25e14 - 1.296e15 = 0.625e15 - 1.296e15 = -0.671e15.

But in the formula, it's (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / Teff^4 = (6.25e14 -1.296e15)/1.296e15 = (0.625e15 - 1.296e15)/1.296e15 = (-0.671e15)/1.296e15 = -0.518.

Multiply by 0.1 (the A_spot/A_star) → 0.1 * (-0.518) = -0.0518 → 5.18% dip.

So the fractional change in brightness is about -5.18%. The amplitude is 5.18%.

Now, the question is asking what radius of a planet would produce the same amplitude when transiting the star.

The transit method: when a planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some light. The fractional change is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Because the area blocked is π R_planet^2, and the area of the star is π R_star^2 → the ratio is (R_p / R_s )^2.

So we want the same fractional change, 5.18% → 0.0518.

Set (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.0518 → R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, that's about 0.227. But looking at the options, options are 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32.

Hmm, none of these match 0.227.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through again.

Wait, the star's brightness dip from the spots is 5.18%, so the planet's transit should cause the same dip.

So for the exoplanet, the dip is (R_p / R_s )^2.

Set that equal to 0.0518, so R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, but none of the options are close to 0.227. The closest option is D) 0.32, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's effect.

Wait, alternative approach: wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe the spots are on one hemisphere, and during rotation, only a part is visible. So perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, the star is observed from Earth, and when it rotates, only a portion of the spotted hemisphere is visible at any time. Wait, but the problem states that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So regardless of rotation, you have all of the spots on one side, but as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing the brightness variation.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has a radius equal to the sun, and the spots are on one hemisphere, so when it rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible, which is when the entire hemisphere is facing us. But that can't be, because a hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface, but the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me re-calculate A_spot.

The star's surface area is 4 pi R^2.

The spotted hemisphere has an area of 2 pi R^2. The filling factor is 20%, so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So the fraction of the star's area covered by spots is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1 or 10%. So A_spot/A_star = 0.1.

So that part was correct. So the area fraction is 0.1.

But when the star rotates, the spots on the rear hemisphere are not visible. So the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us, but the spots only cover 0.1 of the star's surface. So the maximum dip is when the entire 0.1 area is blocked, but the star's brightness is lower in that area.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the brightness variation as a function of time is due to the spots being in or out of view. So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area (0.1 of the star's surface) is on the visible side.

Wait, no. The star's hemisphere is entirely spotted. So the other hemisphere is unspotted. So when the star is at a certain rotation phase, the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and nothing is blocked. As the star rotates, the spots on the edge come into view, but wait, no—this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the spots are on one side, and as the star rotates, the spots come into view, but the area covered by spots that are visible increases.

Wait, perhaps another approach: if the star has a spotted hemisphere, the maximum dip would be when the spot is fully visible. But the spot is only on one hemisphere, so when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots are either on the far side or the near side. Wait, no—this doesn't make sense. Wait, the star's rotation would make the spots come into view. So when the star rotates, the spots move into our line of sight, and the brightness decreases as the spots become visible.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted area is on the near side. So the maximum dip is 0.1 * ( (5e3^4 -6e3^4 ) /6e3^4 ), which we calculated as about 5.18% dip.

So I think my earlier calculation is correct.

But then, the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p / R_s )^2, which is 0.0518, so R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, but none of the options are close to this. The options are A)~0.39, B)~0.07, C)~0.11, D)~0.32.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the spot's effect. Let me re-calculate the (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) part.

Compute (5000^4 /6000^4) = (5/6)^4 = (0.8333...)^4.

Compute 0.8333^4:

0.8333^2= approx 0.6944.

0.6944^2 is approx 0.4823.

So 5000^4 /6000^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So then, the fractional difference per spot is (0.4823 - 1) = -0.5177.

Multiply by 0.1 (A_spot/A_star) → -0.05177, which is about 5.177% dip.

Which is what I had before. So that gives R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2277.

Hmm, so the planet radius is about 22.77% of the star's radius.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is different because the spots are on one hemisphere, and when the star rotates, the spots are only partially visible as the star's disk is viewed edge-on. No, wait, the star is observed from Earth, the spots are on one side, so as the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of view. But the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible, which is 0.1 of the star's surface.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to appear only on the limb, and the area that's blocking is a circle that's only a part of the star's disk. Hmm, no, the spots are circular regions on the surface, but in reality, when a spot is on the limb, the projection can cause it to be a smaller area. Wait, but I think the A_spot/A_star is still 0.1, regardless of where the spot is on the disk.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor because the spots are on a hemisphere and only rotate into view. But no, the area calculation already accounts for the entire area of the spots on the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the brightness variation being due to the rotation and the spots being on only one side. So when the star is viewed face-on (like with a pole-on inclination), the spots take up 0.1 of the area, and the dip is 5.18%. When the star is edge-on, the spots would be on the limb, but the area projected would be less. But no, the problem says the star is observed such that the rotational modulation is causing brightness changes. Hmm, maybe the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is on the near side, but perhaps the average dip is lower.

Wait, wait, perhaps the amplitude is not just the maximum dip but the average variation. Hmm, but the problem says the same amplitude signal. So perhaps the star's light curve has a dip of about 5.18%, which the planet's transit would have to match.

So given that, the planet's radius would need to be about 0.227 times the star's radius. But that's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Because the star's spots are cooler, the star's total brightness is lower when the spots are in view. But when the planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, but doesn't change the star's emitted flux. So the planet's effect is a simple blocking, which is (R_p/R_s)^2. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's emitted flux. The star's total flux without spots is F = 4 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4. The spots contribute F_spot = A_spot * sigma T_spot^4. The rest of the star is F_unspotted = (A_star - A_spot) * sigma T_eff^4.

So the total flux when spots are visible is F = F_unspotted + F_spot.

Without spots, F = F_unspotted + F_spot_initial, where F_spot_initial would be A_spot * sigma T_eff^4.

Wait, no. The unspotted star would have all areas at Teff. So the total flux would be F = 4 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

When spots are present, the flux is F = (4 pi R^2 - A_spot) sigma T_eff^4 + A_spot sigma T_spot^4.

So the flux when spots are present is F = 4 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 - A_spot sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

The fractional change is (F - F_0 ) / F_0, where F_0 is F without spots.

So (F - F0)/F0 = [ - A_spot sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 )

Simplify: delta F / F = (- A_spot ( T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 pi R^2 T_eff^4 )

But A_spot is 0.4 pi R^2, so:

delta F / F = (- 0.4 pi R^2 ( T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 pi R^2 T_eff^4 )

Cancel terms:

delta F / F = (- 0.4 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 T_eff^4 )

= (- 0.1 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / T_eff^4 

= - 0.1 (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) )

Which is same as:

delta F / F = -0.1 (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

So (5000/6000) =5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = approximately 0.4823.

So delta F/F ≈ -0.1 (1 - 0.4823 ) = -0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ -0.05177, as before.

So same result. So the dip is about 5.177%.

So for a planet, the dip is (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.05177 → R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the star's flux is being compared to the planet's transit. Alternatively, the scenario is that the spots are the same as a planet, but that's not the case.

Wait, the problem says, "as only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet."

So the brightness variation from the spots is similar to that of a planet transiting. Now, the question is to find what planet radius would produce the same amplitude.

But perhaps the way the spots modulate the brightness is different. Because the spots are on one side, the brightness when the spots are in view is lower, but when the star rotates, the spots are no longer in view, so brightness increases again.

Wait, but the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. The star's brightness varies between F0 (no spots visible) and F0 - delta F (maximum spots visible).

So the amplitude is delta F.

Wait, but when the planet transits, the maximum dip is (R_p/R_s)^2, which is a simple dip. So the question is to find R_p such that (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.05177.

So R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2277.

But none of the options are near that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39^2=0.152 → 15.2% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% dip.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → ~1.21% dip.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → 10.24% dip.

Wait, I'm getting 5.18% dip. So the closest option is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to appear as a smaller area. Because when a spot is on the limb, the area visible is less than when it's on the center.

Wait, but when calculating the maximum dip, the spot would be fully visible when the spot is on the center of the star's disk. If the spot is on the limb, the area is foreshortened, so the visible area is less. But the maximum dip occurs when the spot is fully visible, so the area is 0.4 pi R^2.

Wait, no. The star's surface area is 4 pi R^2. If the spot is on the limb, the projection reduces the area. But the actual area is 0.4 pi R^2 regardless.

Wait, but when the spot is on the limb, the visible part is a circle with a certain projected area. Hmm, this might complicate things. So perhaps the calculation I did earlier isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation isn't a simple dip of 5.18%, but a modulated variation as the spots rotate into view. But the problem states that the amplitude is the same as the planet's transit dip. So perhaps the spot-induced dip is the same as the planet's dip.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The problem says that the brightness variation from the spots is similar to that of a planet. But perhaps the depth of the spot-induced dip is the same as the planet transit dip.

Wait, perhaps the spot-induced dip is more complicated. For example, the spot's effect depends on the angle of observation, so the maximum dip occurs when the spot is at the center of the disk, and the dip is deeper when the spot is larger on the disk. But when the spot is on the limb, the apparent area is smaller.

But the problem says that the star has a radius equal to the sun, and the spots cover one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots move into view, and the observed brightness variation is due to the changing area of the spots that are visible.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the light curve. As the star rotates, the spots come into view. When a spot is at the center, the maximum area is visible. As it moves to the limb, less area is visible because the spot is foreshortened.

The total area visible as the spot rotates is A_visible = A_spot * cos(theta), where theta is the angle from the center. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but for the purpose of calculating the average effect, maybe I should integrate over the rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip is when the spot is at the center, so A_visible = 0.4 pi R^2. But that's the maximum dip. The average dip would be lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness. So the maximum dip is when the entire spot is visible, which is 0.4 pi R^2, and the minimum is when the spot is not visible. Wait, but the star's brightness without any spots would be 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4. When the spot is in view, the brightness is 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the maximum dip is when maximum area is visible, which is when the spot is in the center → A_visible = 0.4 pi R^2. So the dip is 0.4 pi R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4 )) → which is (0.4 /4 ) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4 = 0.1 (1 - (T_spot^4/Teff^4 )) → which is the same as before, 5.177%.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is 5.18% dip.

So the planet needs to produce the same amplitude, which would be (R_p/R_s )^2 = 0.0518 → R_p= ~0.227 R_s.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the maximum dip with the semi-amplitude. Because when the planet transits, the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2. But maybe the rotational modulation of the star's brightness is an average effect, not a simple dip.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is similar to that of a planet. So perhaps the amplitude is the same, so the dip must be the same.

But given that, the options don't match, so perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is considering both the increase and decrease of brightness as the star rotates, but no, the star's brightness is only decreasing when the spots are in view.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as a sinusoidal function due to the spots rotating in and out of view. But perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is the peak-to-peak. Alternatively, the amplitude could be the semi-amplitude (half the peak-to-peak).

Wait, if the peak-to-peak amplitude is 10.35% (double 5.175%), then the semi-amplitude is 5.175%. But if the planet's transit produces a dip of 5.175%, then the same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not the hemisphere. Oh wait, the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not the entire star. So the area is 0.2*(2 pi R^2 ) = 0.4 pi R^2, as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the star's rotation period and the time it takes for the spot to come into view, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, is there another factor? Oh, perhaps the star's inclination. When the star is viewed edge-on, the spots are on the limb, so the visible area is less than when viewed face-on. But the maximum dip would still be 5.177% regardless of inclination.

Wait, but if the inclination is such that the star is viewed edge-on, the spot would only be a circle on the limb, so the area projected is smaller. Hmm, but in that case, the maximum dip would be when the spot is at the center, which is when the star is viewed face-on. Wait, no, if the star is viewed edge-on, the spot would only be on the limb, but the area visible would be less. Wait, no— wait, the spot is on one hemisphere, but the star's rotation makes that hemisphere face the observer. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is facing the observer. But that can't be, because a hemisphere is 50% of the star, so the maximum dip would be when the entire hemisphere is visible, but the spots only cover 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, but the star's surface is 4 pi R^2. If the entire hemisphere (2 pi R^2) is facing us, and the spots cover 20% of that (0.4 pi R^2), then the dip is (0.4 pi R^2) * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)/Teff^4.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. If the star's dip is 5.18%, and the planet's dip must be the same, then the required R_p/R_s is about 0.227, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Compute (5000^4 /6000^4):

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.833333333.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4)/T_eff^4 = (0.482253 - 1) = -0.517747.

Multiply by A_spot/A_star =0.1 → 0.1 * (-0.517747) = -0.0517747.

So the dip is 5.17747% → 0.0517747.

So R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2275.

So about 0.2275 R_sun.

But none of the options are close. The options are A:0.39, B:0.07, C:0.11, D:0.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2. Let me reevaluate.

In transit photometry, the dip is (R_p/(R_s))^2. So 0.2275 is correct. But perhaps the question is asking for the radius of the planet relative to the host star, which is the same as what I calculated.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again. Option D is ~0.32, which is 0.32^2 = 0.1024 → 10.24% dip. That's about double the 5.18% I calculated. So perhaps I missed a factor of two somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the star's surface area is 4 pi R^2, but the area of the hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. So when the star rotates, the spots are in view, but the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted is (0.2 * 2 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi R^2 ) = 0.1, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is considering the planet's area relative to the hemisphere's area, not the entire star. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the planet would block a certain fraction of the star's light, but the star's brightness is already modulated due to spots. Wait, no, the question states, "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet."

Ah, that's a crucial point. The scenario is that if the star had no spots, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude as the spot-induced variation.

Wait, but in the presence of spots, the amplitude is 5.18%. So the planet would need to block 5.18% of the star's light, which is (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.0518 → R_p/R_s ~0.227.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness is modulated as the spots rotate into and out of view, leading to a sinusoidal variation. The amplitude would then be the peak-to-peak variation divided by two.

Hmm, but that would still give the same calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness is only modulated by the spots on the hemisphere, not the entire surface. So when a spot is on the far side, it's not seen, and when it's on the near side, it's fully seen. So the maximum dip is when the spot is at the center, but perhaps the average dip is when the spot is on the limb, leading to a lower dip.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as the spot moves across the disk.

The observed brightness as a function of time would be the sum of the unspotted star's flux and the spotted area's flux. The area visible depends on the position of the spot on the disk.

The maximum dip occurs when the spot is at the center, so the area is maximum. The minimum dip occurs when the spot is on the limb, with the area foreshortened.

So the average dip would be the integral of the brightness over a full rotation, divided by the rotation period.

Hmm, but this might complicate things. Let me think: the brightness as a function of time would vary sinusoidally if the spot is a single point, but for a large spot, the variation could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is modeled as a sinusoidal function with a certain amplitude, which is the maximum dip minus the average brightness.

Wait, if the maximum dip is 5.18% and the minimum is 0% (no dip), the peak-to-peak variation is 5.18%, and the semi-amplitude is 2.59%.

But then the planet's transit would have a dip of 5.18% (peak-to-peak), so the semi-amplitude would be 2.59%, which would require (R_p/R_s)^2 = 2.59% → R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.0259) ≈ 0.161.

But that's still not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me look for another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation due to spots can be approximated by a sinusoidal function with amplitude A, and the planet's transit would have a dip of the same amplitude A.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the star's brightness variation as the same as the planet's transit. So the amplitude of the star's brightness variation is the same as the planet's dip.

In that case, the planet's dip is (R_p/R_s)^2 = amplitude of the star's variation.

If the star's variation is 5.18%, then R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the calculation is wrong because the star's brightness variation is not just the maximum dip but the integrated effect over the rotation period.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation due to spots is an average dip, not the maximum dip.

So perhaps the average dip is less than the maximum dip.

How do we compute the average dip as the star rotates?

As the star rotates, the fraction of the spotted area visible varies. The average dip would be the average over all phases of the spot's contribution.

So let's model the problem: the star has a single spot covering 20% of one hemisphere. The spot's area is A_spot = 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2.

The star's rotation period means that the spot moves across the disk. The fraction of the spot visible at any time is a function of the spot's position.

The brightness at any time is F = F0 - (A_visible) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

The average F over a full rotation would be F_avg = F0 - (A_spot) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4 * (average A_visible / A_spot )

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the average A_visible is the average area of the spot visible as it rotates. For a spot on the hemisphere, the average area visible is 2/3 of the spot's area.

Wait, that's an approximation for a spherical cap. The average area visible of a circular spot on a sphere as it rotates is (2/3) of the spot's area.

Wait, perhaps for a spherical cap, the average projected area is 2/3 of the actual area.

So A_visible_avg = (2/3) * A_spot.

So the average dip would be (A_visible_avg / A_star) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4.

So A_visible_avg = (2/3) * 0.4 pi R^2 = 0.2667 pi R^2.

A_visible_avg / A_star = 0.2667 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.2667/4 ≈ 0.06667.

So the average dip is 0.06667 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) → 0.06667 * (1 - 0.482253 ) = 0.06667 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.0345 or 3.45%.

So the average dip is about 3.45%.

If the planet's transit must produce the same average dip, then (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.0345 → R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.0345) ≈ 0.1857.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the entire star's flux but only the hemisphere's flux. So the star's brightness variation is due to the spots on one hemisphere. So the maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is visible, but the spots cover 20% of it.

Wait, so in that case, the area of the spot is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 / 2 = 0.2 pi R^2. Wait, no, the hemisphere area is 2 pi R^2. The spot covers 20% of this, so 0.4 pi R^2.

So when the entire hemisphere is visible, the area of the spot is 0.4 pi R^2. So the dip is (0.4 pi R^2) * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)/Teff^4.

Wait, but the star's total area is 4 pi R^2, so (0.4 pi R^2)/(4 pi R^2) )= 0.1. So same as before.

I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the dip as (R_p/R_s )^2 = 0.0518 → R_p=0.227 R_s. But none of the options match. So perhaps I should look for a possible calculation error.

Alternative approach: perhaps the temperature difference is 1000 K below the star's temperature. So T_spot is Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K. Correct.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 0.23, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, but why?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots covering the entire hemisphere, but that's not the case. The problem states 20% of the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the area of the planet's disk relative to the area of the star's disk, ignoring the temperature effect. So the dip is (R_p/R_s )^2 = 0.0518 → R_p=0.227 R_s. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as having a certain brightness, but the planet as a blackbody. No, the planet blocks the light, so the dip is due to the area blocked.

Wait, perhaps the spots are on one hemisphere, and the planet is causing the same amount of blockage as the spots. So the area of the planet is (R_p/R_s )^2 * A_star.

So setting (R_p/R_s )^2 * A_star = A_spot → (R_p/R_s )^2 = A_spot/A_star → 0.1 → R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316. Which is option D) 0.32.

Ah, that makes sense! Because the area blocked by the planet would be equal to the area of the spots. So the planet's area is 0.1 of the star's area, so R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.1)≈0.316.

That's option D) ~0.32.

Wait, but earlier I considered the dip as being due to the temperature difference, not just the area. So perhaps the problem is treating the brightness variation as just the area blocked, not considering the temperature. But that can't be right because the spot's effect is due to lower temperature, not blocking.

Hmm, but the question says, "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star."

So if the star wasn't spotty, the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_s)^2. The spot-induced dip is due to temperature differences, so the dip is 0.0518, but the planet's dip is (R_p/R_s)^2. So to have the same amplitude, (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.0518 → R_p/R_s ≈0.227.

But if the question is considering the spots as causing a dip equal to the area blocked (as if the spots were completely dark, not considering temperature), then the dip is 0.1, so (R_p/R_s)^2=0.1 → R_p=0.316 R_s. Which is option D.

But the question says the star's spots have a temperature difference, so the dip is due to that. So the correct calculation includes the temperature factor.

Hmm, but the answer isn't among the options. Perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, which is 0.1^2=0.01 → 1% dip. But that's much smaller than the 5.18% dip we calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as causing a dip of (filling factor) * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)/Teff^4. So filling factor is 0.2, but perhaps it's 0.2 of the hemisphere, which is 0.1 of the star's area. So the dip is 0.1*( (5000^4 -6000^4 ) /6000^4 ) → which is same as before.

I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest match to 0.227 is not present, but option D is 0.32, which is sqrt(0.1) = 0.316. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the star's radius. The star's radius is equal to the sun, so R_star = R_sun. The planet's radius is R_p. So when the planet transits, it blocks (R_p/R_sun)^2 of the star's light.

But I'm not making progress. I think I should proceed with the calculation I have, which leads to R_p ~0.227 R_s, but since the options don't match, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as a sinusoidal function, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation divided by two. So if the dip is 5.18%, the amplitude would be 2.59%, leading to (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.0259 → R_p ~0.161 R_s. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's effect in a different way. For example, the star's brightness with spots is F = F0 - delta F, where delta F is the dip. The planet's transit would cause F = F0 - delta F_planet, where delta F_planet = F0 * (R_p/R_s)^2.

So setting delta F_planet = delta F.

So (R_p/R_s)^2 = delta F / F0 = 0.0518 → R_p=0.227 R_s.

But again, no option matches.

At this point, I think I've made a mistake earlier, and perhaps the correct approach is to find R_p where (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.0518, which is approximately 0.227, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's entire surface area, but the spots are on one hemisphere and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere, making the area 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2. So the ratio is 0.4 pi R^2 /4 pi R^2 = 0.1 → so the dip is 0.1*(T_spot^4 - T_eff^4)/T_eff^4.

So the dip is 5.18%, so the planet's dip must be 5.18%, leading to R_p=0.227 R_s.

But no option matches, so perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, which is 0.1^2=0.01, but that's much smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's area as 20% of the entire star's surface. So A_spot =0.2*4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2. Which would give A_spot/A_star=0.2, leading to a dip of 0.2 * (0.482253 -1 )= 0.2 * (-0.517747 )= -0.10355 → 10.355% dip.

So R_p^2=0.10355 → R_p=0.322 R_s.

Which is option D) ~0.32.

Ah, that must be it. So perhaps the problem intended that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not the hemisphere.

So if the star's radius is R_sun, and the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, then A_spot = 0.2 *4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

So A_spot/A_star =0.2.

Then the dip is 0.2 * ( (5e3/6e3)^4 )= 0.2 * (0.482253) → 0.09645, so the dip is 9.645% → wait, no, because (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) is negative.

Wait, no: the dip is 0.2 * ( (5e3^4 -6e3^4)/6e3^4 )= 0.2 * (-0.517747) = -0.10355 → 10.355% dip.

So the planet's dip must be 10.355% → R_p = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322 R_s.

Which is option D) ~0.32.

So perhaps the correct approach is that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not the hemisphere. That would explain the answer choice.

So in that case, the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler by 1000 K (5000 K). The goal is to find the exoplanet's radius relative to the star's radius, \( R_p / R_s \), such that the amplitude of the brightness variation matches.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Spot Area Calculation**:  
   The star's total surface area is \( 4 \pi R_s^2 \). The hemisphere has an area of \( 2 \pi R_s^2 \), and the spots cover 20% of this hemisphere. Thus, the total area covered by spots is:  
   \[
   A_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_s^2 = 0.4 \pi R_s^2
   \]  
   The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:  
   \[
   \frac{A_{\text{spot}}}{A_{\text{star}}} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_s^2}{4 \pi R_s^2} = 0.1
   \]

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   The fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible is given by:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F} = \frac{A_{\text{spot}}}{A_{\text{star}}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4 - T_{\text{eff}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
   \]  
   Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( \frac{A_{\text{spot}}}{A_{\text{star}}} = 0.1 \):  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F} = 0.1 \cdot \frac{5000^4 - 6000^4}{6000^4}
   \]  
   Calculating \( \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.48225 \):  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F} = 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.051775
   \]  
   This corresponds to a brightness variation of approximately \( 5.18\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Transit Brightness Variation**:  
   For a planet transiting the star, the fractional brightness variation is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F} = \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2
   \]  
   To match the brightness variation caused by the spots (\( 5.18\% \)), we set:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 = 0.051775
   \]  
   Solving for \( R_p / R_s \):  
   \[
   \frac{R_p}{R_s} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.227
   \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( R_p / R_s \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem assumes the filling factor applies to the entire star's surface (not just one hemisphere), the area covered by spots would be:  
   \[
   A_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \times 4 \pi R_s^2 = 0.8 \pi R_s^2
   \]  
   This changes the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots to:  
   \[
   \frac{A_{\text{spot}}}{A_{\text{star}}} = \frac{0.8 \pi R_s^2}{4 \pi R_s^2} = 0.2
   \]  
   Recalculating the brightness variation:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F} = 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.10355
   \]  
   This corresponds to a brightness variation of approximately \( 10.36\% \). Setting this equal to the planet's brightness variation:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 = 0.10355
   \]  
   Solving for \( R_p / R_s \):  
   \[
   \frac{R_p}{R_s} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322
   \]  
   This matches option **D) ~0.32**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the filling factor applies to the entire star's surface, not just one hemisphere. Under this assumption, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius is approximately \( 0.32 \). 

Answer: D
