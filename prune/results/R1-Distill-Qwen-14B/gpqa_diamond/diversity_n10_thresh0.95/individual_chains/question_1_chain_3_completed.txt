Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, but wait—each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, perhaps we should consider the uncertainty in the energy of each state to determine if they can be distinguished.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference (E2 - E1) between the two states. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty from the lifetimes might make it hard to tell them apart.

So, let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1 with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and similarly for ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference should be significantly larger than the uncertainties in each state so that they can be resolved.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and then ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum or something. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy measurement would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, or perhaps the larger of the two.

Wait, let me think. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, the uncertainty in energy for a state is roughly ħ divided by the lifetime of that state.

So for E1, with τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1), and similarly for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 τ2).

But since τ2 is longer than τ1 (1e-8 s vs 1e-9 s), ΔE2 will be smaller than ΔE1. Because a longer lifetime means a lower uncertainty in energy. So ΔE1 is ħ/(2 * 1e-9) and ΔE2 is ħ/(2 * 1e-8). Which means ΔE1 is about 10 times larger than ΔE2.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 is (E2 - E1). To distinguish them, this difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in each state's energy. Or is it the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of how the energy difference relates to the uncertainties. Let's compute the uncertainties.

First, I know that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert ħ into eV·s.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ (1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-19) eV·s ≈ approx 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, for each state:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) eV.

Calculating that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV. So about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for ΔE2: ħ/(2 τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV, which is about 3.29e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainty in E1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and E2's uncertainty is about 3.29e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 is (E2 - E1) = ΔE. To clearly distinguish them, this ΔE needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, or the maximum uncertainty. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, but wait, I think when considering two states, the maximum possible uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy has its own uncertainty, so the difference between them would have an uncertainty of ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let me think again. The energy difference's uncertainty is actually the root mean square, perhaps, but in many cases, for simplicity, it's considered as the sum. Alternatively, maybe it's the maximum of the two.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it. Suppose we have two energies, each with their own uncertainties. The uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), assuming the uncertainties are independent and uncorrelated. But if the two states are being measured in the same experiment, perhaps the time uncertainty for the difference is the same as the maximum of the individual lifetimes? Hmm, but I'm not quite certain.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference's uncertainty is the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. Because if you have two states, each with their own lifetimes, the energy difference's uncertainty might be determined by the shorter lifetime. Because the shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy, so that would dominate.

Wait, in this case, for ΔE between E2 and E1, the uncertainty would be the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty. So, the main uncertainty when measuring the difference would come from the state with the larger ΔE, which is E1.

So, ΔE_uncertainty ≈ ΔE1 = 3.29e-7 eV.

Thus, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than this uncertainty for them to be distinguished.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because if you're looking at the energy levels, the energy difference's uncertainty would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, perhaps. Because the energy difference's uncertainty is the quadrature sum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because each energy level has its own uncertainty. The difference would have an uncertainty of sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are independent and uncorrelated.

But in this case, since ΔE1 is much larger than ΔE2 (3.29e-7 eV vs 3.29e-8 eV), the sum of squares would be approximately (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ≈ (3.29e-7)^2 (since 3.29e-8 is an order of magnitude smaller).

So sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

So the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 3.29e-7 eV. Therefore, to clearly distinguish E2 and E1, the energy difference (E2 - E1) must be greater than this value.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's bigger than 3.29e-7 eV (which is 0.000000329 eV). So option C would be sufficient.

Other options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → still smaller than 3.29e-7 eV.

So the only option that's larger than 3.29e-7 eV is option C (1e-4 eV).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me calculate the exact value of the uncertainty in the energy difference. I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Earlier, I calculated ΔE1 as (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Hmm, so the uncertainty in E1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and the uncertainty in E2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So the difference's uncertainty would be sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So, any energy difference larger than that would be resolvable.

So the energy difference must be larger than 3.29e-7 eV, which is approximately 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options again, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is much larger than 3.3e-7, so it would be resolvable.

But wait, what's the exact value? Let me compute 3.29e-7 eV as 0.000000329 eV. Option C is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 times larger than 3.29e-6 eV. Wait, no, wait: 3.29e-7 is 0.000000329, and 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 329 times larger than 3.29e-7. So yes, it's way bigger.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but why is option D 1e-8 eV? That's about 3.29e-8 eV, which is about the same as the ΔE2. So that would not be larger than the uncertainty of 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, so the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference, which is about 3.29e-7 eV. So the only option that's larger is C (1e-4 eV).


To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference. The uncertainty in energy for each state is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For a given state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}.
\]

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in energy for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is approximately the quadrature sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E_1 \gg \Delta E_2 \), we approximate:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is much smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is much larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.

Answer: C
