Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see. I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices, especially for particles like electrons or muons which have spin-1/2.

The question says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator and it's given as c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π), which is a constant. The matrix S has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. I think S is the Pauli Y matrix, but let me think. No, wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh wait, σy is usually [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? That's exactly what S is here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), then Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. But wait, I also remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator is usually given by ħ times the Pauli matrices. Oh, but ħ is h/(2π), right? So the spin operator S would be (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli vector. Wait no, maybe I should correct that. The spin angular momentum operator for each component is S_i = ħ/2 σ_i. So for Ay, which is the Y-component, it should be (ħ/2) σy.

Wait, but in this problem, Ay is given as c * S, and c is h/(4π). Let me compute h/(4π) in terms of ħ. Since ħ is h/(2π), then h/(4π) is ħ/2. So c = ħ/2. Therefore, Ay = (ħ/2) σy, which matches the standard expression for the Y-component of spin. So that checks out.

Now the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and it's proportional to σy, which is a Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues should be ± the coefficient times the eigenvalues of σy.

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So for σy, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Therefore, when scaled by c=(ħ/2), the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1). So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait a second. ħ is h/(2π), so substituting that in, the eigenvalues would be (h/(2π))/2 * (±1) → h/(4π) * (±1). Wait, that's h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Alternatively, that's ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Looking at the options, let's check.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh and the real part ±h/(4π). Wait, but eigenvalues of Ay are real numbers, right? Because angular momentum operators have real eigenvalues. So an eigenvalue can't have an imaginary part. So option A is talking about the eigenvalue having imaginary parts, which doesn't make sense. So A is wrong.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Hmm, but again, eigenvalues are real, so that's not possible. So B is incorrect.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Wait, A is the y-component. A² is the square of the angular momentum in the y-direction. But for spin-1/2 particles, the square of any component (like S_x², S_y², S_z²) is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I, where I is the identity matrix. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A², right? Because A² would have the eigenvalue (ħ^2/4) for any eigenstate of Ay. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az, the z-component?

Wait, if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate. But for spin-1/2, the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. Because Sx, Sy, Sz don't commute. So if a state is an eigenstate of Sy, it can't be an eigenstate of Sz. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That sounds correct. So C could be the correct statement.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure about that. The basis functions of the operator Ay are probably the standard basis vectors, but eigenfunctions are specific vectors that satisfy Ay φ = a φ. So the eigenfunctions would form a basis for the space, but the wording here is a bit unclear. I'm not sure if D is correct. It's possible, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about option C again. So if φ is an eigenvector of Ay, then it's an eigenvector of A² as well because A² is proportional to the identity matrix, which commutes with everything. So any vector is an eigenvector of A². So yes, C is correct in that part.

But the second part of option C says not of Az. That is correct because the eigenstates of Sy (Ay/ħ) don't commute with Sz. So yes, eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the actual eigenstates. Let's compute the eigenvectors of Ay. Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix is:

[ [0, (-i)(h/(4π))],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

The eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), as we found earlier.

To find the eigenvectors, let's take each eigenvalue and solve (Ay - a I) v = 0.

Let's take a = h/(4π), the positive eigenvalue.

So Ay - a I is:

[ [-a, (-i)(h/(4π)) ],
  [i*(h/(4π)), -a ] ]

Substituting a as h/(4π):

[ [ -h/(4π), -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -h/(4π) ] ]

We can factor out h/(4π):

h/(4π) * [ [ -1, -i ],
            [ i, -1 ] ]

The matrix is:

[ -1  -i ]
[ i  -1 ]

To find eigenvectors, let's set the first row equal to zero.

First row: -v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Wait, let me compute it. So v1 = -i v2. Let v2 =1, so v1= -i. So the eigenvector is [-i, 1], or any scalar multiple.

Similarly, for the negative eigenvalue, a = -h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

[ [ h/(4π), -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), h/(4π) ] ]

Factoring out h/(4π):

h/(4π) [ [1, -i], [i, 1] ]

The first row is v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = i v2. Let v2 =1, then v1= i. So the eigenvector is [i, 1]^T.

So the eigenvectors are phi_+ = [-i, 1] and phi_- = [i, 1], up to normalization.

Wait, but let me check normalization. The eigenvectors are [-i, 1] and [i, 1]. Let's compute their norms.

The norm squared is | -i |^2 + |1 |^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. So to normalize, we divide each by sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvectors are (1/sqrt(2)) [ -i, 1 ] and (1/sqrt(2)) [ i, 1 ].

Now, the question is about which statements are correct. Let's look at the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

A² is the square of the operator Ay, but wait, no. Wait, no, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum, which has components Ax, Ay, Az. So A is the vector operator, so A² would be (Ax² + Ay² + Az²). Wait, no, A² is the square of the magnitude, which is the sum of squares of the components. So when you have an eigenstate of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of A², unless you're in a state that's an eigenstate of the square of the magnitude. But wait, no, because A² is a scalar operator, and for any state, it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue (ħ/2)^2 * 3? No, wait, no. Wait, A² for spin-1/2 is (S_x² + S_y² + S_z²) which equals ( (ħ/2)^2 ) ( σ_x^2 + σ_y^2 + σ_z^2 ), but the sum of squares of Pauli matrices is 3I. So S² = (ħ^2/4) * 3 I. So any state is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue (3 ħ² )/4.

So, for any state, including the eigenstates of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². So option C's first part is correct.

As for the second part, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. Because, for spin-1/2, the Sx, Sy, Sz operators don't commute with each other. So if a state is an eigenstate of Sy (Ay), it can't be an eigenstate of Sz (Az), unless perhaps in the case of a simultaneous eigenstate, but for different components, that's not possible.

So option C is correct.

Looking at option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions for the operator would probably be the standard basis vectors. But the eigenfunctions are specific vectors, which in this case are combinations of the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions might form a different basis. But I'm not sure what the statement is saying. I think D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are a basis for the space, but they might not be the standard basis functions. Wait, the standard basis is e1 = [1,0] and e2 = [0,1]. The eigenfunctions are phi_+ = [-i,1] and phi_-. So they form a different basis, but I'm not sure if the statement in D is correct. The statement says "the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." I'm not sure what that means exactly. Maybe it's incorrect because the basis is determined by the operator, but I'm not certain. So I'll tentatively go with option C being correct.


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = h/4\pi \) and \( S \) is the 2×2 matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). 
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), where \( c = h/4\pi \). Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \pm h/4\pi \).

2. **Imaginary Parts of the Eigenvalues:**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real numbers (\( \pm h/4\pi \)), so they do not have imaginary parts. This eliminates **Option A**, which incorrectly states that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts.

3. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - Solving for the eigenvectors of \( A_y \), the eigenfunctions are proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), up to normalization. These eigenfunctions are specific linear combinations of the standard basis vectors.

4. **Option B:**
   - This option incorrectly states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 1/2 \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). Since the eigenvalues are real and equal to \( \pm h/4\pi \), this option is incorrect.

5. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) because \( A^2 \) is a scalar operator proportional to the identity matrix. However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This makes **Option C** correct.

6. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are specific linear combinations of the standard basis vectors and do not form the standard basis for the operator \( A_y \). This makes **Option D** incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \(
