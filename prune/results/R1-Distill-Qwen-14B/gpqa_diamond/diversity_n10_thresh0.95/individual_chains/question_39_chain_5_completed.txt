Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

We have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm, so wave functions in quantum mechanics have to satisfy certain conditions. The most important one I remember is that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be 1.

Wait, but in this case, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That looks like a complex wave function. Oh right, the wave function can be complex, but when you take its absolute square, the imaginary parts will factor in. Let me think about how to compute that.

The absolute square of a complex number z = p + qi is |z|^2 = p^2 + q^2. So for the given wave function, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the square would be (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|^2 is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Wait, but that would make it (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Because the wave function is a function of x, so each x has its own real and imaginary parts. So the square is (Re(ψ))^2 + (Im(ψ))^2. So yes, that's correct.

So the probability density is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.25). But wait, that doesn't seem right because if the wave function is a sum of real and imaginary parts, the absolute square is |ψ|^2 = ψ*ψ*, where * is the complex conjugate.

So the wave function is ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Its complex conjugate is ψ* = (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So ψ*ψ would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] * [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ].

Multiplying these out: (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)(0.5i). Wait, but the cross terms would cancel out because one is positive and the other is negative. So we're left with (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.25)(i^2). But i^2 is -1, so that becomes (a^2)/(1+x) - 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right because the probability density can't be negative. Oh wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, let me recalculate the product. Let me denote A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = 0.5i.

So ψ = A - B.

ψ* = A + B.

ψψ* = (A - B)(A + B) = A² + AB - AB - B² = A² - B².

So yes, because the cross terms AB and -AB cancel out. So ψψ* is A² minus B².

A is a real number? Because it's a/sqrt(1+x), which is real. B is imaginary, 0.5i.

So A² = (a^2)/(1+x).

B² = (0.5i)^2 = (0.25)(i^2) = -0.25.

So ψψ* = (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Oh, right! Because B² is negative, so minus B² becomes plus 0.25.

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, that seems a bit strange. Because if a is a real number, then this expression is always positive, which makes sense for a probability density.

But wait, the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when we calculate the probability, it's not just the square of the real part, but the sum of squares of real and imaginary.

So the probability density is (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1 because the total probability is 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

Breaking it into two parts: ∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First integral: ∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C. So,

a² [ ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) ] = a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So adding both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So rearranging: a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Thus, a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, let me recompute the steps.

1. The probability density is |ψ|^2 = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

2. Integrate from 1 to 3:

∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = a² ∫1/(1+x) dx + ∫0.25 dx.

Which is a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.25*(2) → a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Set equal to 1: a² ln(2) +0.5 =1 → a² ln(2) =0.5 → a² = 0.5/(ln2). 

Compute 0.5 / ln2: ln2 is about 0.6931, so 0.5 /0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approx 0.85 → option B.

So the correct answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in all space must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The total probability is the integral of the probability density over the region where the particle exists, \( x \in [1, 3] \):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)
2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\)

### First Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding the two parts together:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest value to \( a \) among the options is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
