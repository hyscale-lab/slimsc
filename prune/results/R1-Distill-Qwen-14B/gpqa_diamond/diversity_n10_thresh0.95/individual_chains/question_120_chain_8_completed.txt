Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed probably means they are spread out in all directions without any particular pattern, right? But wait, when they say uniformly distributed, are they talking about in space, or in the observed sky? I think it refers to spatial distribution because parallax relates to distance, so in space, they are spread out uniformly.

Parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that the parallax (plx) in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. The formula is plx = 1/distance (d). So, d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, for a given small range of parallax, how many stars are there?

Let me think about the volume of space. Since stars are spread uniformly, the number of stars in a volume should be proportional to the volume. But the volume depends on distance. Let's model this.

Imagine we have a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell would be the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (dd). So Volume = 4πd² dd.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this volume would be n = N * (4πd² dd), where N is the number density of stars (stars per unit volume). 

But wait, how does this relate to parallax? Since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, let's substitute d with 1/plx.

So, volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * d(1/plx) * (because d is 1/plx, so dd is -d(plx)/d plx) Wait, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

Let me think: d = 1/plx. So, dd = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. So, dd = -1/(plx²) d(plx). Wait, perhaps I should express the volume in terms of plx instead.

Alternatively, let's change variables from d to plx. So, the number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between d and d + dd, where dd is the change in distance corresponding to dplx.

Since d = 1/plx, dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since we're dealing with a differential, the negative sign just indicates direction, but for the count, we take the absolute value. So, the volume is 4πd² * dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, wait, let me see:

Wait, actually, d = 1/plx. So, dd = derivative of d with respect to plx, which is - (1)/plx² dplx. So, the thickness in distance is |dd| = (1)/(plx²) dplx.

So, the volume of the shell is surface area (4πd²) times thickness (dd). So substituting, Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. 

Wait, wait, hold on. That would make the volume proportional to (1/plx^4) * dplx. But wait, the volume is 4π d² dd. Let me compute d² and dd in terms of plx.

d² is (1/plx)^2. dd is (1/plx²) dplx. So, volume becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume is N * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) at a given plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/ (plx^4).

Does that make sense? Let me think again. For small changes in parallax, the number of stars in that range is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So, as plx increases (distance decreases), the number of stars per unit plx drops off as 1 over plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait a second, but I might be getting confused between differential counts. Let me think about it in another way. The number of stars in a volume element dV is N dV. So, dN = N dV.

If plx is the variable, and we're considering a small change in plx, dplx, the corresponding volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π / plx^4 dplx, as I had before.

So, dN = N * (4π / plx^4) dplx. So, dN/dplx = 4π N / plx^4.

Which is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hmm, but wait, I'm not so sure. Because the number of stars per unit volume is N, so the number in a shell is N * 4π d^2 dd. And since d is 1/plx, substituting that in, it becomes N *4π (1/plx^2) * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. So 4π N / plx^4 dplx.

So yes, the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the function is ~1/plx^4. So the answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, with the relationship given by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), and since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

The volume of the shell in terms of parallax becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means that as parallax increases (distance decreases), the number of stars per unit parallax decreases rapidly.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \)**.

Answer: A
