Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me think about what that means. The molecular formula can sometimes hint at the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, plugging in: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring, a double bond, and maybe an aromatic structure. Since the NMR has peaks around 6-7 ppm, which usually suggests aromatic protons, so I'm guessing there are aromatic rings involved.

Looking at the NMR data:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes other deshielded protons can be there, but aldehyde makes sense.
- 6.98 (d, 2H): This is a doublet, maybe aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted benzene? Because two protons, each seeing one neighbor. So perhaps two aromatic rings each with substituents.
- 6.51 (d, 2H): Another doublet, perhaps another set of aromatic protons, maybe adjacent to substituents.
- 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Could these be protons next to an oxygen, maybe an enol or something with some hydrogen bonding? Or perhaps allylic protons. Wait, but the 'bs' could indicate exchange broadening, like adjacent to an OH group, but in this case, the compound's formula has an O, so maybe there's an alcohol or something else.
- 3.66 (d, 2H): A doublet, probably CH2 next to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 group or something like that. Or perhaps part of an ether.

So putting this together, maybe the structure has an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and an O-linked CH2.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see. If the structure has an aldehyde (CHO), which is -CHO, that's 1 C, 1 O. Then, the rest of the formula is C7H9N. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think.

Looking at the NMR: 9.72 (t, 1H) is probably the aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Like R-CH2-CHO. That would explain the triplet as the aldehyde proton is next to the CH2 (two protons). So the 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be the CH2 connected to the aldehyde. So maybe it's something like CH2CHO attached to another structure.

Then, the aromatic protons: 6.98 and 6.51. Let me consider that. If there are two doublets, each with 2H, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene. Wait, but the 6.98 is a doublet of 2H, and 6.51 is another doublet of 2H. So maybe two para-substituted benzene rings, each with substituents. So perhaps each benzene has a substituent, and their protons are split into doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted ring, with two substituents and the protons being in a para arrangement.

Wait, the 6.27 (bs, 2H) is a bit confusing. Maybe it's a pair of protons that are not in a symmetrical environment, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. Since the molecular formula has an O, maybe an -OH group. But wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So if it's a substituted benzaldehyde with some substituents, perhaps including an -OH.

So, maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with substituents. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Let me think about the NMR shifts. The aldehyde is at 9.72, so that's a good indicator. Then, the 3.66 ppm could be an OCH2 group. Maybe the compound has a structure like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that would be C8H8O, which doesn't fit. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So perhaps another group with N is present.

Wait, the formula has one N. So maybe an amino group? Or something else. Wait, the NMR doesn't show any peaks that look like NH protons, but maybe the N is in an amide or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with a side chain that includes an amine or something.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diphenyl compound. Because the NMR shows multiple aromatic signals. Let me think, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, perhaps two benzene rings (each C6H5 would take 12 C, but we only have 8 C, so that's not possible. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, if it's diphenyl something, but the formula is C8H9NO, which has 8 carbons. Two phenyl groups would take 12 carbons, which is more. So that can't be. So perhaps a single phenyl group, but with substituents.

Wait, but the NMR shows multiple aromatic protons. Let's see: 6.98 (d,2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That adds up to four aromatic protons. So maybe the benzene has two substituents, each causing two protons each. So perhaps a para-dimethyl group? No, but given the shifts, maybe two substituents, each with an H.

Alternatively, maybe the benzene is 1,4-disubstituted. Let's say substituent A and substituent B are in the para positions. Then each substituent would cause two protons each. So perhaps one substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like -CHO) and another is an electron-donating group (like -OCH2-CHO? Wait, that might complicate.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an aldehyde group and another group. Wait, but wait. The aldehyde is a substituent on a benzene ring. So the structure could be benzaldehyde plus another substituent, like an -OCH2CH2... something.

Wait, the 3.66 (d, 2H) is probably a CH2 group attached to something. So maybe it's OCH2 connected to another group. Let's think: perhaps the structure is benzaldehyde with an OCH2CHO group attached. Wait, but that would be more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like (4-hydroxyphenyl)propanal. Let me see. 4-hydroxyphenyl would be C6H5O. Then propanal would be CH2CH2CHO. Wait, but that might not fit the molecular formula.

Alternatively, let's think about the steps in the reaction. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

So the first step, NaNO2 and HCl, is typically used in the synthesis of diazonium salts. But wait, that's usually for aromatic amines. Wait, but wait, the initial compound has an N. So maybe the N is in an amine group. Wait, the original molecular formula is C8H9NO, which includes one N. So, perhaps the initial compound has an amine group, which would react with NaNO2 and HCl to form a diazonium salt.

Wait, but let me think about the possible structure. If the initial compound has an aromatic ring with an amino group, and perhaps an aldehyde group.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any NH protons. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe the amine is part of a ring, like a pyrrole or something else. Or perhaps it's an aniline derivative, but in a different form.

Wait, but the reaction steps: first, diazotization (step 1), then H2O (step 2), then aqueous KOH and heat (step 3). So after diazotization, perhaps the diazonium salt undergoes hydrolysis to form a phenol.

Wait, if the initial compound has an aniline group (-NH2), when treated with NaNO2 and HCl, it would form a diazonium chloride. Then, heating with H2O (maybe under acidic conditions) would hydrolyze the diazonium group to a phenol group. Then, in step 3, aqueous KOH and heatâ€”could that be some kind of elimination reaction or perhaps a hydrolysis if there's an ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a nitro compound, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The NMR shows an aldehyde, so maybe the structure has an aldehyde group attached to something else.

Wait, the initial structure's NMR has 9.72 (t, 1H), which is aldehyde. Let me think of the structure as something like R-CHO, where R is a group that has a benzene ring and other substituents.

So, perhaps R is a benzyl group with some substituents. Let's say R is a benzyl group attached to an O-linked CH2, which is connected to another benzene ring. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let me compute the formula for that.

Wait, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. But our compound is C8H9NO, so an extra CH2 group and some other atoms.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's subtract HNO from C8H9NO: that gives C8H9NO - HNO = C8H8O. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde and some functional groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like 4-(hydroxyphenyl)propanal. Let me see: that would be C6H5O-CH2-CHO. Wait, but that would be C8H7O2, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde with an OCH2 group attached, and also an amino group. So for example, the structure could be benzaldehyde with an OCH2CH2NH2 group attached. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let's count: benzene (6 C), CHO (1 C), OCH2CH2NH2 (3 C, O, N, 8 H). So total C: 6+1+3=10? No,
