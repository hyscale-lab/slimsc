--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reagents sequence to synthesize a specific compound. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break that down. The main structure seems to be a cyclohexane ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2 group, which also has an -OH (hydroxyl) group. Additionally, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached at the same carbon, I think. Wait, no, wait. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (so, -CHO) attached. And at the 1-position (which is adjacent to the aldehyde), there's a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached. Or perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl on the same carbon? Hmm, maybe it's a branching.

Wait, maybe the structure is better thought of as cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, the aldehyde is on a carbon that's attached to another cyclohexane ring and a hydroxymethyl group. Let me try to imagine the structure. The main ring is cyclohexane. Attached to it is a carbonyl group (CHO), and on the same carbon as the CHO, there's a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group. So it's like:

R-C(=O)-CHO where R is cyclohexyl? Maybe not. Wait, the IUPAC name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is cyclohexane with a -CHO group. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same carbon as the aldehyde. So the substituent is a methyl group that's attached to cyclohexyl and hydroxy. So it's a branching on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So the structure is:

The cyclohexane ring has a carbon where the aldehyde is attached. That same carbon has another CH2 group connected to it, which is attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl group on the aldehyde carbon.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. So the starting material is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, that's CH2CH2 with a triple bond between two carbons attached to the cyclohexane. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

I need to find the reagents that will take ethynylcyclohexane to the target compound. Let me think about the steps involved in such a synthesis.

The target has a carbonyl group (aldehyde), a hydroxyl group, and a cyclohexyl substituent. Let me think about the transformations needed.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne (the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH group). So, perhaps the first step is to do some kind of alkyne functionalization.

Option A in the choices has NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That's a typical method for deprotonating alkynes and then alkylating. So, NaNH2 is a strong base, and in the presence of methyl chloride (CH3Cl), it would perform an alkylation. For a terminal alkyne, deprotonation would give a strong base, which can then react with an alkyl halide. So, adding methyl chloride would give cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH2 group? Or wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl; when you deprotonate the alkyne, you get a strong base (like the acetylide ion), which can attack CH3Cl. So ethynylcyclohexane would react to form cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2- (but wait, CH3Cl has CH3 as the leaving group when attacked by the acetylide. So, the alkyne would get a methyl group added. So the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3? No, wait, the alkyne is H-C≡C-cyclohexane. Deprotonating gives cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+, then CH3Cl would give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl. Wait, no, that's not right. Alkylation of an alkyne with methyl chloride would add a methyl group. So H-C≡C-R (where R is cyclohexane) would become CH2Cl-C≡C-R? No, wait, perhaps it's better to think that the acetylide reacts with methyl chloride. The acetylide would attack CH3Cl, leading to substitution. So the product would be CH3-C≡C-R. So adding a methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes methylcyclohexenyne? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between alkyne and alkene here.

Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give the acetylide ion: cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate to form cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl. But that's a chloroalkyne, which might not be what we want. Alternatively, perhaps the step is to add a methyl group, making the alkyne longer.

But wait, looking at the target molecule, which has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the aldehyde. So maybe the alkyne is being converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an enol ether or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, the triple bond might undergo some hydrogenation. Looking at the options, some have H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation. For example, option C has step 2 as H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene.

Hmm. Let me think about how to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, then possibly modified further.

Wait, another possible pathway: The alkyne could be converted into a carbonyl group. For that, oxidation would be needed. For terminal alkynes, oxidation with a strong oxidizing agent like O3 (ozone) in a workup could form a diketone, but that's for alkenes. Wait, for alkynes, oxidation typically gives either carboxylic acids or ketones, depending on the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogensed to an alkene, then the alkene is epoxidized or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target structure again. The main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group. Then, attached to the same carbon as the CHO is a CH group that's connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the aldehyde carbon.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. The plan is to convert this into a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent.

Let me outline a possible pathway:

1. Convert the ethynyl group (C≡CH) into a carbonyl group (CHO), perhaps by oxidation. But wait, how? For terminal alkynes, oxidation can give a carboxylic acid (RCOOH) under strong acidic conditions, but that's with KMnO4, H2SO4, heat. Alternatively, under milder conditions, like O3, maybe different products.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or undergoes some other reaction.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a cyclohexylmethyl group, then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated and undergoes a coupling reaction, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, let's consider the reagents in the options.

Option A: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So that's deprotonation and alkylation, adding a methyl group to the alkyne. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, maybe. Wait, H2 and Pd usually hydrogenate triple bonds to cis alkenes. But if the alkyne is longer, perhaps it becomes a trans alkene? Wait, when you hydrogenate an alkyne with H2 and Pd, you get cis addition, forming the cis-alkene. Alternatively, if you use Lindlar’s catalyst, you get the trans-alkene. But without that, it's cis.

So after step 1 of option A, the alkyne becomes a longer chain. Let me see: starting with cyclohexane-C≡CH, after adding methyl chloride, we get cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl. Then step 2 is H2/Pd; hydrogenating the alkyne would give cyclohexane-CH2-CH2Cl? Wait, no. Because hydrogenation of an alkyne (C≡C) would add two H2 molecules, turning triple bond into single bond. So for each alkyne, you add two H2s. So, cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2Cl after hydrogenation? Or wait, wait: the alkyne is C≡C, adding H2 would convert it to CH2-CH2. Wait, no. The triple bond (C≡C) has two pi bonds. Adding H2 across the triple bond would add two Hs per C. So for each C in the triple bond, you add one H from each H2. So, the triple bond C≡C would become CH2-CH2.

So, cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2Cl after hydrogenation. Then, what's the next step? Option A has step 3 as Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions, like the formation of epoxides or in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Wait, or maybe it's used for the formation of epoxides from diols. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 can be used in the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a Birch reduction? No, that's with metals like Na and NH3.

Wait, but step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which sounds like a Jones oxidation. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used for oxidizing alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions.

Hmm, let me think about the possible steps. Perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.
3. Oxidation or some reaction to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are to form a diol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are as follows:

After adding a methyl group and hydrogenating, we get a cyclohexyl-substituted compound with a CH2Cl group. Then, Ba(OH)2 might be used for elimination. Wait, but after that, the next step is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is Jones oxidation. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne + methyl chloride → longer alkyne.
2. Hydrogenate alkyne to alkane (CH2Cl).
3. Ba(OH)2: Maybe epoxidation? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation step.
But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe looking at another option would help.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li and liquid NH3; then O3 and H2O; then NH4OH.

So, step 1 would add an ethyl group to the alkyne. Then, step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which is a strong base and used for deprotonation, perhaps for elimination. Then, O3 and H2O could be ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. But wait, the starting material here is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne. Ozonolysis is for alkenes. So perhaps step 2 forms an alkene from the alkyne. Wait, but the reagents are Li and liquid NH3. That's for elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, maybe it's for deprotonating and forming an alkyne?

Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the aldehyde. So perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a diol, then oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then epoxidized, then opened to form a diol, and then oxidized.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then something else.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis steps are as follows:

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane into a cyclohexylmethyl group with a hydroxyl group.
2. Oxidize to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about each option's steps.

Option C: Steps are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 4 is Ba(OH)2 again. Hmmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the target structure. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the aldehyde. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then into an aldehyde, and the substituent is added via some reaction.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group. How could that be done? Using an oxidizing agent like O3 (ozone) would require an alkene, not an alkyne. Alternatively, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions could oxidize a terminal alkyne to a carboxylic acid. But that would give a COOH group, not a CHO group.

Wait, but if we have an alkyne, and we perform partial oxidation, perhaps using a milder oxidizing agent, like O3, but that usually acts on alkenes. Alternatively, using a catalytic hydrogenation followed by oxidation?

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylate to add a methyl group → longer alkyne.
2. Hydrogenate alkyne to cis-alkene.
3. Ozonolyze the alkene to form carbonyl groups.
4. React with something to form the substituent.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexylmethyl group via alkylation, then the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, and then oxidized to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl substituent on the same carbon. So maybe the alkyne is being used to form a ring or a substituent.

Alternatively, the correct approach is to first perform a dehydrohalogenation or elimination to form an alkene, then perform ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, another angle: the target has a cyclohexane ring, a substituent with a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde. So perhaps the substituent is part of the same ring, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a branch on the main cyclohexane ring.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let's think about each option's possible steps.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li and liquid NH3; then O3 and (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is CH3OH. Deprotonating the alkyne with NaNH2 would give the acetylide, which would react with methanol. But methanol is a methyl group source. So, adding methanol would give the acetylide (cyclohexane-C≡C^-) reacting with CH3OH, so the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2-OH? Or wait, perhaps it's a substitution: the acetylide (strong base) would deprotonate the CH3OH, giving CH3O^- and H+? Wait, no, wait. Acetylide is a strong base and would attack the electrophilic carbon in CH3OH. So, the acetylide (cyclohexane-C≡C^-) would attack CH3OH, leading to cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding a methyl group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the step is a nucleophilic substitution where the alkyne acts as a base. Wait, perhaps the reagent is more about deprotonation and alkylation, but with methanol, which is not an alkyl halide. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to add a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, step 1 in option D is NaNH2 and methanol. So, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol, which would add a hydroxymethyl group. So the alkyne becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2-OH.

Wait, but how? Because methanol is CH3OH. The acetylide (cyclohexane-C≡C^- ) would attack the methyl in CH3OH, leading to cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps the acetylide would abstract a proton from methanol, leading to the formation of an alcohol.

Wait, I'm not too clear on this. Let me move on and perhaps come back.

In any case, the target molecule has a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group attached to the aldehyde.

Let me think of the possible reagents:

The presence of O3 suggests ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if an alkene is present, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps one of the steps is to form an alkene from the alkyne, then ozonolyse it.

Looking at option B: steps 3 and 4 are O3 and H2O, then NH4OH. Wait, step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe that's for elimination to form an alkene.

So, option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne with ethyl group.
2. Li and liquid NH3 → deprotonate and eliminate to form an alkene.
3. Ozonolysis → cleavage into carbonyl groups.
4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes.

But wait, how does that lead to the target structure? Let's think about it.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, alkylation with ethyl chloride would give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then, step 2 is Li and NH3. Li is a strong base; perhaps it deprotonates the alkyne and induces elimination. Wait, but the alkyne is already a triple bond; elimination would form something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated first, but step 2 doesn't involve H2.

Wait, perhaps Li in NH3 is for dehydrohalogenation. But in this case, there's no halide. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is for forming a trans-alkene via elimination. But I'm not sure.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate alkyne to cis-alkane.
3. O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would cleave any double bonds. If step 2 converts the alkyne to a single bond, then there's no double bond for ozonolysis. So, perhaps this is not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene. Wait, H2/Pd would hydrogenate a triple bond to a single bond, not a double bond. Oh wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne depends on the conditions. Using H2 and Pd, the alkyne would typically hydrogenate to the cis-alkene. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I thought that H2 and Pd might hydrogenate the triple bond all the way to a single bond. Let me double-check: Alkyne hydrogenation with H2 and Pd typically goes all the way to the alkane. So, cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl (from step 1) would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2Cl after step 2.

Then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone usually reacts with alkenes, but if step 3 is after full hydrogenation, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So that can't be right. So option C's steps don't make sense.

Another option: perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, but that would require a different catalyst, like Lindlar's for cis. But none of the options mention that. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't go to completion, but I don't think that's the case.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol; then Li and NH3; then O3 and (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

Hmm.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, the alkyne is treated with NaNH2 and CH3OH. As I thought earlier, the acetylide would react with methanol. But what's the product? The acetylide is a strong base, so perhaps it deprotonates methanol, leading to CH3O^- and H+? But that's not a productive path. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide attacks the methanol's methyl group, leading to CH3-O-C≡C-cyclohexane. But that's not a typical reaction. Perhaps instead, the acetylide would pick up a methyl group from CH3OH via some substitution, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the acetylide attacks a methyl group, but I don't think CH3OH is a good source for that. Maybe this step is for adding a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the target molecule again.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH) group, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → introduce a hydroxyl group via some addition.
2. Oxidize to form an aldehyde.
3. Add the cyclohexyl group.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to get the cyclohexyl group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alcohol using some method, then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So perhaps the alkyne is being used to form a ring.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is being converted into a cyclohexane ring via some ring-closing reaction. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, and then a cyclohexyl group is added via some alkylation.

Wait, but I'm not seeing a clear path. Let me think about each option's possible outcomes.

Looking at option B: steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li and NH3; O3 and H2O; NH4OH.

Step 1: Alkyne alkylation with ethyl chloride → ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH2Cl.

Step 2: Li and NH3. Li is a strong base. In liquid NH3, perhaps it's for elimination. The compound has a Cl on the end. So maybe elimination occurs: Cl is a leaving group, and Li would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH2Cl → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH2Cl → elimination of HCl → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2Cl → no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the chloride is on the alkyne, so elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, if the starting material after step 1 is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH2Cl, which is an alkyne with a CH2CH2Cl group. Then, in step 2, elimination (using Li and NH3) could form a double bond between the two carbons. So, the Cl would leave, and a double bond would form. So, the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH2Cl → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH=CH2 (but wait, that would require eliminating HCl from the adjacent carbon. Wait, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2-CH2Cl. Elimination would occur between the CH2Cl and the adjacent CH2. So, the H and Cl are on adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2-CH2Cl → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH=CH2 and HCl elimination. Wait, but that would require two CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is on the end, so elimination would form a triple bond to a double bond? Not sure.

Then, step 3 in option B is O3 and H2O. Ozonolysis of an alkene would cleave it into carbonyl groups. So, if after step 2, we have an alkene, ozonolysis would break it. But if the product after step 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, the target has a single aldehyde group, not two. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an alkene, which is then ozonolyzed into a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach: perhaps the correct reagents sequence involves adding a methyl group, then hydrogenating, then oxidizing.

Looking at option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li and liquid NH3; O3 and (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

Wait, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. As before, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol, adding a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

In any case, perhaps the correct steps are as follows:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne (using NaNH2 and CH3Cl) → longer alkyne.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane (CH2Cl group).
3. Ozonolysis won't work here unless a double bond is present, but if step 2 fully hydrogenated the alkyne to a single bond, then step 3 would have no double bond to react with.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step doesn't go all the way, leaving a cis-alkene.

Wait, but that would require specific catalysts, like Lindlar's for cis, but none of the options specify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis is done. But I'm not seeing how that would form the aldehyde and the substituent.

Another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexene via some ring-opening, but that's too vague.

Wait, perhaps the target is formed via a Grignard reaction. But I don't see any Grignard reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via oxidation, then a cyclohexyl group is added via some alkylation.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let's think about the answer options again.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, and then a cyclohexyl group is added via some reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some steps, and then a cyclohexyl group is added as a substituent.

Alternatively, the alkyne is treated to form a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexyl-substituted alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to cis-alkene → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 (but that gives a single bond, not a double).
Wait, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then perhaps a dihydroxylation can occur.

But without knowing, perhaps I should look for the correct reagents.

Another approach: the target has a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So perhaps that hydroxyl is formed via an epoxide opening or some other method.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then into a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has the hydroxyl and aldehyde on the same carbon. So perhaps the alcohol is adjacent to the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group,
