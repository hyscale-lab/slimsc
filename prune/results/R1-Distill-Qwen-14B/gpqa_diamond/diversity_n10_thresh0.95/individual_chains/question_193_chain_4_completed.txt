Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Hmm, let me read it again: astronomers observe that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, r, per unit range.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax in arcseconds is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is distance in parsecs. Or wait, no, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So if distance r increases, plx decreases.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me substitute plx in terms of r. Since plx = 1/r, then 1/plx would be r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, so perhaps they're asking about the density or the change in number as you go to larger distances.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: if N is proportional to r^5, that would mean as r increases, the number of stars increases rapidly. But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because when you look further away, you're looking into a larger volume, but the number of stars per volume (density) might change. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between the total number and the number per unit volume.

Wait, the original problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is some constant. Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k * (r^5). So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if I have a certain region, the number of stars increases as r^5? That can't be right because when you go to larger r, the volume increases as r^3. So the number of stars should depend on how the density changes.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of flux or density. Let me see: the number of stars in a region (assuming uniform density) would be density multiplied by volume. But if the number varies as r^5, then perhaps the density is changing. Let me model this.

Suppose the number of stars N is proportional to r^5. So N = A * r^5, where A is a proportionality constant. But number of stars should relate to the volume, which is (4/3)πr^3. So if N is proportional to r^5, that implies that the density (stars per volume) is proportional to r^2. Because N = density * volume, so density = N / volume = (r^5) / (r^3) ) = r^2. So density increases with r squared.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's about the differential number, like dN/dr. If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the number of stars in each unit distance increases as r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4. Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

Wait, so if dN/dr is proportional to r^4, the number per unit distance would increase as r^4. But wait, I'm not sure if the question is about the total number or the density or the differential.

Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." Hmm, maybe it's asking for the number of stars per unit distance interval, which would be dN/dr. Because per unit range implies the change in N with r.

Since N is proportional to r^5, dN/dr is 5 r^4, so the number per unit distance increases with r^4. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the exact wording. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, 1/plx = r, so 1/(plx)^5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Now, if in a region of the sky, as r increases, the number of stars in that region increases as r^5. But that seems counterintuitive because the volume increases as r^3. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the number of stars is being counted.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the region is a thin shell between r and r+dr. The number of stars in that shell would be the surface density multiplied by the area of the shell and thickness dr. But wait, surface density is stars per unit area per unit distance? Or maybe it's better to model this in terms of flux or density.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a volume is increasing as r^5. So the number per unit volume would be N/(volume) = (r^5)/(r^3) = r^2. So number density is r^2. That would mean that the density of stars increases with the square of the distance. But that's a bit odd because in reality, stars are more concentrated in the galaxy's plane, but perhaps this is a different scenario.

Wait, the question says "in a specific region of the sky." So maybe it's a spherical region with radius r. The number of stars in that region is N = k * r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance—so per unit distance. So the change in N per unit change in r would be dN/dr, which is 5k r^4. So the number of stars added per unit distance increases as r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C) ~ r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)) in parsecs, i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relation, we find \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars in the region increases as \( r^5 \) with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the differential change in \( N \) with respect to \( r \), i.e., \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), we compute \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance interval increases as \( r^4 \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \( r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the change per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( r^5 \):** Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( r^4 \):** Correct, as \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( r^2 \):** Incorrect, as this does not match the derived proportionality.

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance interval increases as \( r^4 \). 

Answer: C
