Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its characterization data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll go through each of the spectroscopic data points one by one and see what they can tell me about the structure of the compound.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, a broad peak could also suggest a strong hydrogen bond, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But the presence of a broad peak might point towards an -OH group.

Then, there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a region where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids) absorb. The 1650 could be another carbonyl but maybe in a different environment, or perhaps it's an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Alternatively, the 1650 might be an amide I band, but I don't think that's applicable here since I don't see any options with N.

Wait, but looking at the options, all are O-containing. So the 1700 might be a carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone or an acid. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring—maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ester or something similar.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, maybe in a vinyl group or as part of an aromatic ring. Since it's vinyl, maybe it's an alkene, not necessarily aromatic.

Looking at the Mass Spectrometry data: a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I need to think about what fragments give that mass. 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2O (which is 15 + 15 + 15? Wait no, (CH3)2O has molecular weight (12*2 + 1*6 + 16) = 46. Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps it's an ethyl group with something else. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2CH2O group? Or maybe the molecular ion breaks into a smaller fragment.

Wait, 45 could be CH2CH2O? Wait, no. Let me think of possible fragments. Another possibility is that it's a ketone group. Or perhaps it's a (CH3)COH group. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl ester group fragment. Or maybe it's the loss of something else.

Alternatively, 45 could be the mass of a CH2CH2O group or something else. Wait, 45 is also the mass for (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Acetone's molecular weight is (12*3 + 1*6 + 16) = 58. Wait, no, but if it's a fragment, like a (CH3)2CO+ would be m/z 58. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2CH2O group, but that's 46. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe the fragment is CH2=CH-O- something. Wait, but that might not sum up to 45. Let me think differently. Another approach is to consider the molecular formula and see what possible fragments could lead to 45.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2 → possible structures could be something like an ester, maybe like methyl something.

B) C6H10O → perhaps an alcohol with a double bond.

C) C6H10O2 → maybe a diester or something with two carbonyl groups.

D) C6H12O → maybe an alcohol with a ring or a double bond.

Now, considering the FTIR: 1700 and 1650. If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. The 1650 could be the C=O in another ester group, but that's less likely. Alternatively, it might be an aromatic ring's C=C. If the compound has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached, like a ketone or an ester attached to benzene, then the C=C in the ring would absorb around 1600-1650 cm^-1.

Wait, but the presence of two carbonyls? Let's think. If the compound has two carbonyl groups, like a diester or a ketone and an ester, then the IR would show peaks for both. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic C=C.

But the 1650 is slightly lower than the typical 1680 for an ester. Hmm.

Moving to the NMR: the presence of vinyl protons suggests an alkene. So the structure has a double bond. So maybe it's a cyclic compound with a double bond, like cyclohexene, but functionalized. Or an aromatic ring.

Wait, but if it's an aromatic ring, the protons on the ring would appear in the aromatic region (around 7 ppm), but the vinyl could be part of an ester group, like in an allyl ester.

Now, the Mass Spec: fragment at 45. Let me think about what could break off as a fragment with m/z 45. Let's calculate the possible molecular formulas that sum to 45.

45 is the mass, so let's find combinations:

Carbon: 45 / 12 is about 3.75. So likely 3 carbons: 3*12=36. Remaining 9. So 9 = 16 (O) + 1 (H) → but that would be 17, so maybe 36 + 9 =45. Wait 36+9=45, so 3 carbons, 9 hydrogen? No, because 3 carbons have 6 H if all CH2, but maybe it's a methyl group attached.

Wait, let's think about possible molecular formulas for a fragment with mass 45. Let's calculate:

Possible combinations:

- C3H7O: molecular weight would be 3*12 +7*1 +16 = 36 +7 +16=60- no, that's too big.

Wait, wait. Maybe the fragment is C2H5O2? Let's see: (2*12)+(5*1)+(16*2)=24 +5 +32=61 → no. Hmm.

Alternatively, C3H8O: 3*12 + 8 +16=36+8+16=60. Not 45.

Wait, maybe C3H6O2? 3*12=36, 6 H is 6, O2 is 32 → 36+6+32=74. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is C2H3O, but that's 2*12 +3 +16=24+3+16=43→ not 45.

Hmm, maybe C3H3O: 3*12 +3 +16=36+3+16=55. No.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)2O group. (2*12)+(4*1)+16=24+4+16=44. Close but not 45.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment is a methyl group with some oxygen. Wait, methyl ester would be OCH2CH3, but that's 46 for the fragment (CH2CH3O). Wait, 12*2 +6 +16 = 46. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula of the main molecule is C6H10O2. Let's see. The molecular weight would be 6*12=72 +10=82 +32=104. So 104 g/mol. If the fragment is 45, perhaps it's losing something. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a part of the molecule.

Wait, another thought: the mass 45 could be CH3COO- (acetate) as a fragment. The acetate ion is C2H3O2^−, which has a mass of 2*12 + 3*1 +32 = 24+3+32=59? Wait, that's 59. But the fragment is 45.

Wait, maybe it's a different group. Let me think about the possible fragments in the options.

Options:

A) C6H12O2 → molecular formula would be (6*12) +12 +32 =72+12+32=116. The fragment 45 is part of this.

Possible fragments: Perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller part, like a CH2CH2O group? Let me see. Suppose the molecule is an ester, like methyl something. For example, methyl cyclopentene carboxylate? Not sure.

Alternatively, if the formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10=82 +32=104. So a fragment of 45 is possible. For example, if the molecule is something like methyl vinyl something, the fragment could be methyl something.

Wait, another approach: the possible molecular formula for the fragment at 45. Let's compute:

45 = sum of (12*c +1*h +16*o). Let's find possible c, h, o.

Let me try different o values.

o=1: then 12c +h =45-16=29.

Looking for c and h where 12c +h=29.

Possible c=2 → 24 → h=5 → 24+5=29.

So C2H5O. Is that a possible fragment? That would be an ethyl group with an oxygen. Maybe an ethyl ester group. Or perhaps a fragment like OCH2CH3, which is 46. Hmm, but 45 is nearby. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl group.

Wait, another option: o=0 → 12c +h=45. Let's see c=3 → 36 → h=9. So C3H9. But that's a higher H count than typical.

Alternatively, o=2: 12c +h =45-32=13. So c=1 → 12, h=1 → 13. So C1H1O2. That's unlikely, as O2 would be like O-O, but not sure.

Hmm, maybe the fragment is C3H7O. Let's calculate: 3*12=36, 7 H =7, O=16. 36+7+16=59. No, not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's a ketone fragment. For example, acetone would be (propan-2-one) which is (CH3)2CO. Its molecular weight is 58, so a fragment would be higher than 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH2=CHO group. Let me calculate: CH2=CHO would have a formula of C2H3O. 2*12=24, 3 H=3, O=16. 24+3+16=43. Not 45.

Alternatively, CH2CH2O? Let's see: C2H4O. 2*12=24, 4 H=4, O=16. 24+4+16=44. Still not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's a COO- group. COO- would be 12 + 16 +16 + (-) charge, so 44. But that's not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound might help. Let's see each option's possible structures.

Option A) C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc. But given the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, there's a double bond, so the other unsaturation could be a ring.

Option B) C6H10O: Degrees of unsaturation: (12+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees—could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C) C6H10O2: (12+2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees.

Option D) C6H12O: (12 +2 -12)/2=14-12=2 → 2/2=1 degree.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. Depending on the options, let's see.

If the compound has an ester group, that would explain the carbonyl at ~1700 cm^-1. So let's think about esters.

Ester's FTIR: strong peak around 1700 (C=O), and the O-C-O stretch around 1250-1050 cm^-1. But the question doesn't mention those, so maybe it's a different carbonyl.

Wait, the FTIR has two carbonyl peaks. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups. So structure could be something like a diester, or a ketone and an ester, or maybe an acid and an ester.

Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring. For example, a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached (like a ketone or ester) would have the C=O around 1700 and the ring's C=C around 1650.

Wait, but benzene's C=C stretch is usually around 1600, but could shift depending on substitution. So maybe the 1650 is the aromatic ring, and the 1700 is the carbonyl.

If that's the case, then the structure could be something like phenyl acetate, which is an ester. So phenyl group (aromatic) with an ester (OAc group). So phenyl acetate would have the ester carbonyl at ~1700 and aromatic C=C at around 1600-1650.

But in that case, the molecular formula would be C8H8O2. But the options given don't have that. So maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the mass spec. Let's think of each option's possible structures and see which one could give a fragment at m/z=45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester, maybe with a cyclic structure.

If it's a cyclic ester (lactone), the structure would be a cyclic ketone. But not sure.

Alternatively, an ester of a diol with a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. This could be a diester, or perhaps a cyclic ester. Alternatively, it could be an acid anhydride, but that's less likely. Diesters would have two ester groups, so two carbonyls. That would fit the IR data.

Wait, but that would mean two carbonyl groups would show up in IR, which is what the question states.

Additionally, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene.

So for option C, the formula is C6H10O2. Let's think of a structure with two carbonyl groups and a double bond.

One possibility is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R, but that would give a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the structure is an aromatic ring with substituents. Like a substituted benzene with an ester group and a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diester with a double bond. For example, perhaps a structure like CH2CH2(COOH)2, but that's a diacid, which might not fit.

Alternatively, think of the diester like CH2CH2OOC-COO-R, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps it's a molecule with an ester group and a conjugated double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Those have strong carbonyl absorption and the conjugated double bond. The IR might show a carbonyl at around 1650 due to conjugation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diketone, but that would require two ketone groups, which might give two peaks in IR.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the mass spec: 45. Let's see what each option's molecular weight is.

A) C6H12O2 → 6*12=72 +12=84 +32=104. So molecular weight 104.

B) C6H10O → 72 +10=82 +16=98.

C) C6H10O2 →72 +10=82 +32=104.

D) C6H12O →72+12=84 +16=100.

So, the options A and C have the same molecular weight: 104. So the mass spectrum is from a molecule with molecular weight 104, which breaks into a fragment of 45.

So, the molecular ion would be at m/z 104. But the question mentions a fragment at 45. So, perhaps during the fragmentation, a smaller piece breaks off, leaving a larger ion. Or perhaps the molecular ion loses a fragment.

Looking at the options A and C, which both have m/z 104, let's think about their possible structures and what fragment at 45 they might produce.

Option A: C6H12O2. Let's think of it as an ester. For example, if it's methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate or something similar. But how would that fragment? Maybe losing the methyl group (CH3O- perhaps) as a fragment. But methyl group would be 15 (CH3O- has m/z 31). Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe losing a larger fragment.

Option C: C6H10O2. Maybe a diester, or a cyclic ester. If it's a cyclic ester (lactone), perhaps it would have a ring opening during fragmentation. Alternatively, if it's a diester, perhaps it loses a part of the ester.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a ketene group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule contains an ester group which upon fragmentation loses a part, leaving a 45 fragment.

Wait, the fragment m/z=45. Let's think of possible groups. 45 could be the mass of (CH3)CO, which is 59? No, wait 12+ (3*12) + (3*1) + 16?

Wait, maybe it's the mass of (CH2)2O, which is 44. Close but not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps a CH2CH2O group, which would be (2*12) + (4*1) +16 =24+4+16=44. Again, close but not 45.

Wait, wait. 45 could be the mass of a molecule with the formula C3H5O. Let me calculate: 3*12=36; 5 H=5; O=16. 36+5+16=57. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, C2H3O2: 2*12=24; 3 H=3; 2 O=32. 24+3+32=59. No.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think differently. Perhaps the fragment is from an ester group.

An ester group is R-O-CO-R'. Upon fragmentation, perhaps the ester breaks into two parts. For example, if the ester is O-CO-O-, perhaps losing the R group.

Wait, another thought: the ester functional group (O-CO-O-) might fragment into a smaller part. For example, the molecular formula of the fragment would be a part of the ester.

Wait, for option C) C6H10O2, which is 104 g/mol, the fragment at 45 would imply that a part of the molecule with m/z 45 is lost. 104 -45=59. So the remaining part would be 59. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2CH2O) which is 44, but I'm not getting 45. Hmm.

Another approach: the molecular formula for the fragment is C3H7O. Let me check:

C3H7O: 3*12=36, 7 H=7, O=16. 36+7+16=59. No, that's not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's a carbonyl group like O=C-O. The mass of that would be 16+12
