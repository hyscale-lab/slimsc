Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, wait, what's C3h symmetry again? I remember that symmetry in molecules involves certain operations like rotations and reflections that leave the molecule looking the same.

C3h symmetry... I think that refers to a molecule that has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Or maybe I'm mixing it up with another point group. Let me think. The point groups include things like C2, C3, D3, etc. Oh right, C3h is a type of point group. So a molecule with C3h symmetry would have a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's a combination of rotation and reflection.

Wait, no, I think C3h symmetry is part of the dihedral groups. Dihedral groups have n-fold rotation and reflection. So for C3h, perhaps it's a specific arrangement where the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees and also has a mirror plane. Or maybe it's a higher order symmetry. Alternatively, maybe I should think about each molecule's structure and their symmetry.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The choices are labeled A to D, with each option being one of these.

I need to figure out which of these has C3h symmetry. Let me go through each option.

First, triisopropyl borate. I think that's B(O(CH(CH2CH3)2))3. Wait, no, triisopropyl borate would have three isopropyl groups attached to boron. So the structure is like B with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a CH(CH3)2. So the molecule might have some symmetry.

Boron has a trigonal planar structure when bonded to three identical groups, right? So if all three substituents are the same, like three isopropyl groups, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be trigonal planar. Wait, no, trigonal planar is more about the geometry, while symmetry could be higher.

Wait, for a molecule with three identical substituents attached to a central atom, like BF3, the symmetry is D3h. Because it has a three-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. So if triisopropyl borate has three identical groups, it would have D3h symmetry. Or maybe C3v? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, D3h is a dihedral group with a three-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. So D3h would be higher symmetry than C3h. So if the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, it's more likely to be D3h. But I'm not sure if triisopropyl borate has all three isopropyl groups in exactly the same environment. Oh wait, in triisopropyl borate, the boron is at the center, and each isopropyl is the same. So yes, the molecule should be symmetric.

But the question is about C3h symmetry. So if the molecule has D3h symmetry, then it would have more than C3h. So maybe the answer isn't triisopropyl borate.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, I think it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Its structure is similar to adamantane but smaller. Wait, no, adamantane is [3.3.1], quinuclidine is [2.2.2]. So it has three bridgehead carbons. The structure is symmetric.

Quinuclidine has a three-fold rotational symmetry. Because if you rotate it 120 degrees around the axis through the bridgehead, it looks the same. But does it have a mirror plane? I'm not sure. Let me think. Quinuclidine has a chair-like structure but more symmetric. Wait, maybe the structure is such that it doesn't have a mirror plane but has a three-fold rotational axis. So its point group would be D3 if it has a three-fold rotation and three two-fold axes. Or maybe it's C3 if it only has the rotation and no other symmetries.

Wait, I remember that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and three C2 axes perpendicular to it, so its point group is D3. So D3 includes a three-fold rotation and three perpendicular C2 axes. So if that's the case, quinuclidine has D3 symmetry, which is higher than C3h. Hmm. So that's not matching C3h.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. Then it would be C3h. But I thought it's D3. I'm a bit confused here.

Moving on to the third option, the benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That sounds like a complex polycyclic structure. Let me try to parse the name. It's a trifuran system, so three furan rings. The benzo part would be a benzene ring fused to the furans.

The numbering is a bit complicated, but perhaps the structure has multiple rings. Let me imagine it. The benzene ring is fused to the furans in a way that creates a symmetric molecule. Maybe the molecule has a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, in the name, the substituents are at 1,3,4,6,7,9 positions. Oh, perhaps this molecule has threefold symmetry because the substituents are arranged in a pattern that repeats every 120 degrees. If that's the case, then the molecule would have a three-fold rotational axis.

But does it have a mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric along a certain plane, then it would have C3h symmetry. Alternatively, if it's only rotationally symmetric, it would be C3.

The same goes for the last option, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran...hexaone. This sounds like a larger polycyclic system, perhaps with more rings. The triphenylene part suggests three benzene rings, and the rest is a trifuran system.

I'm not exactly sure about these structures, so maybe I should think about each molecule's symmetry.

Another approach: C3h symmetry implies that when you rotate the molecule by 120 degrees, it looks the same. Also, it has a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and reflection.

So for each molecule, let's see:

1. Triisopropyl borate: The boron is in the center, three identical isopropyl groups. So it's symmetric. I think it's D3h symmetry, which includes C3h, but perhaps the molecule has more symmetry than that. So if the question is about C3h, then maybe it's higher, not C3h. So perhaps it's not the correct answer.

2. Quinuclidine: As I thought, perhaps D3 symmetry. So that's also not C3h.

3. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: The molecule might have three-fold rotational symmetry because the substituents are in positions that repeat every three. For example, positions 1,3,4,6,7,9 could be arranged every 120 degrees. So if it has three-fold rotation, but does it have a mirror plane?

Alternatively, maybe it doesn't have a mirror plane, so it's C3. But C3h has a mirror plane, so maybe it doesn't have that. So perhaps this is not the answer.

4. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran...hexaone: So the molecule has a triphenylene group, which is three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way (like a triangular arrangement). The trifuran part is another three rings. So perhaps the entire molecule has a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, triphenylene is a structure where three benzene rings are connected such that each is adjacent to the others in a triangular fashion. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotational axis. If the entire structure is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees, and also has a mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetric along a plane, then perhaps it's C3h.

Wait, but how? Let me think about triphenylene. Triphenylene is symmetric with three-fold rotation. And whether it has a mirror plane? Yes, I think triphenylene has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you imagine a plane that passes through the center and one of the benzene rings, reflecting the molecule would leave it unchanged. So perhaps the molecule has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps it's D3h, which includes more symmetries. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let's think about the options given.

The question is which has C3h symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is triphenyleno[...]trifuran...hexaone. Because that's option A. But wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Another approach: think about the point groups.

C3h has a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it.

Triisopropyl borate: If it's D3h, then it has multiple mirror planes. So yes, it would have C3h as part of its symmetry. But the question is which has C3h. So perhaps any of the options that have D3h would also have C3h symmetry, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for C3h. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, no. Let me try to think. The point group C3h is a subgroup of D3h. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it also has C3h. So if triisopropyl borate has D3h, then it has C3h. But the question is which of the options has C3h.

Wait, but perhaps the question is looking for a molecule with only C3h symmetry and not higher. So maybe none of the options have just C3h. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating. Let me consider each option again.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran...hexaone.

The name suggests a triphenylene group fused to a trifuran. Triphenylene is symmetric, and the trifuran would add more rings. If the entire structure is symmetric with a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran...hexaone.

This is a benzo-fused trifuran. The benzo group is a benzene ring, which is symmetric, but how does it fuse with the furans? If the substituents are arranged symmetrically every 120 degrees, then the molecule would have C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Benzo implies a benzene ring, which has its own symmetry but when fused, maybe the molecule only has C3, not C3h.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. I think this has D3h symmetry. So any symmetry that includes C3h would also have it, but the molecule's point group is D3h, which is higher than C3h. So it's possible that this molecule also has C3h symmetry as part of its higher symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine. As I thought earlier, possibly D3 symmetry, which is higher than C3h. So its point group isn't C3h.

So which of these has C3h?

If the question is looking for a molecule that has C3h symmetry (but not higher), maybe only some of them do. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: benzo[...]trifuran...hexaone.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The benzo-fused trifuran. If the substitution pattern is symmetric with three substituents in a rotational arrangement, then it would have C3 symmetry. But would it have a horizontal mirror plane?

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe looking up some examples would help, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to think based on what I remember.

Another thought: C3h symmetry requires that the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So after a 120-degree rotation and then a reflection, the molecule remains the same.

Triisopropyl borate, if it's D3h, would have more symmetry than just C3h. So if the question is about which molecule has at least C3h symmetry, then triisopropyl borate would, but perhaps the others don't.

But the question is which has C3h symmetry. So perhaps the correct answer is option B or A.

Wait, another approach. Think about the number of symmetry elements.

C3h has a three-fold rotation and a single horizontal mirror plane. So only one mirror plane. Whereas D3h has multiple mirror planes.

So if a molecule has a single mirror plane and a three-fold rotation, it's C3h.

Which of the options fits this?

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran...hexaone (option A) seems to be a molecule with a lot of symmetry. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, and if the trifuran part is arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane.

Benzo[...]trifuran hexaone (option B) probably has a three-fold axis but perhaps also a mirror plane. So it could have C3h.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe triphenyleno is the one that has the correct symmetry.

Alternatively, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option B. Let me think why.

The benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The arrangement of the substituents is every 120 degrees, perhaps in a trigonal planar fashion. So when you rotate the molecule by 120 degrees, all substituents look the same. Also, there's a mirror plane, so when you reflect across it, the molecule remains the same. So that would make it C3h.

Alternatively, the triphenyleno system might have a higher symmetry, but I'm not certain.

Wait, in the IUPAC name, the substituents in option A are 1,3,6,8,11,13. Let me see if that's a symmetric arrangement. Let's imagine a numbering system where the molecule is arranged in three parts, each part having substituents at every 120 degrees. So positions 1, 3, 6, 8, 11, 13 might be arranged in a way that has three-fold symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is arranged such that each ring is symmetric, leading to a three-fold rotational symmetry.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is option B, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle. C3h symmetry is the same as the point group C3v. Because C3h is sometimes referred to as C3v in some notations. Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. I think C3h has a horizontal mirror plane, while C3v has a vertical one.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Point groups are a bit tricky, but I'll try to recall. C3h is a point group where the highest symmetry element is a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees and reflected in a horizontal plane, and it would look the same.

Which of the options has that?

Triisopropyl borate (C) is probably D3h, which is higher than C3h.

Quinuclidine (D) is D3, which is different because it has a three-fold rotation and three two-fold axes, but no mirror plane, so it's not C3h.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran...hexaone. Let's imagine it's a structure where the substituents are arranged in a three-fold symmetric pattern. If it's a benzene ring fused to three furan rings in a symmetric way, perhaps it has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane.

Similarly, option A has a triphenylene group. Triphenylene itself is symmetric with D3h symmetry. So if option A's structure has triphenylene fused in a way that preserves that symmetry, it might have C3h.

Wait, but triphenylene has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So the molecule in option A might have that symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option B. Alternatively, I'm not confident, but I think option B is the correct one.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry implies the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Below is the analysis of each option:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
This molecule contains a triphenylene group fused to a trifuran system. Triphenylene itself has a symmetric arrangement of three benzene rings in a triangular fashion, which suggests a three-fold rotational axis. The trifuran system further contributes to the symmetry. If the entire structure retains a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, it would have **C₃h** symmetry. However, the complexity of the structure makes it less certain whether it strictly adheres to **C₃h** symmetry or has higher symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
This molecule features a benzo ring fused to a trifuran system. The substituents are arranged at positions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9, which suggests a three-fold rotational symmetry. However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is unclear. While the molecule may have a three-fold rotational axis, it is uncertain whether it also has a horizontal mirror plane, making it less likely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate
Triisopropyl borate consists of a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. This trigonal planar arrangement suggests **D₃h** symmetry, which includes **C₃h** as a subgroup. However, since the question specifically asks for **C₃h** symmetry, and this molecule has a higher symmetry group (**D₃h**), it does not match the requirement.

### Option D: Quinuclidine
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a [2.2.2]octane framework. It has a three-fold rotational axis and three perpendicular two-fold axes, giving it **D₃** symmetry. However, **D₃** does not include a horizontal mirror plane, so it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, **Option B** (benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone) is the most likely candidate for having **C₃h** symmetry, as it appears to have a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. The other options either have higher symmetry (**D₃h** for triisopropyl borate) or lack the required mirror plane (**D₃** for quinuclidine).

**Answer: B**
