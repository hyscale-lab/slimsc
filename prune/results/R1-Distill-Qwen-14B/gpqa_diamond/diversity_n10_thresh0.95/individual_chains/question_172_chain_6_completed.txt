Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the visible part of a star, right? And when they say the iron atoms are twice as excited, I think that has to do with their energy levels.

Wait, the question says the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, but wait, the actual energy value might not matter because the problem gives a ratio of excitation. So star_1 has iron atoms twice as excited as star_2. So the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one, I think.

I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my studies. Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)). So if E2 is higher than E1, the ratio depends on the temperature and the energy difference.

In this case, the energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Let me call E2-E1 = delta E. For star_1, the excitation (n1') is twice that of star_2 (n2'). So for star_1, n1'/n2' = 2. Wait, or is it the other way around? Because if star_1's atoms are more excited, maybe more are in the higher energy state. Wait, the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level", so perhaps the number in a higher level is higher. So perhaps n_upper/n_lower is 2 for star_1, and for star_2 it's something else. So the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's maybe 1 or another value? Wait, no, I think the question is that the excitation is twice as much, so the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps (n_upper/n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper/n_lower)_2.

Wait, no, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Hmm. So perhaps the excitation is the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower. So the ratio n2/n1 is higher for star_1 than for star_2. So for star_1, n2/n1 = x, and for star_2, n2/n1 = y. And x = 2y.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of the populations. Let me denote the two energy levels as E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. The excitation is the number in E2 compared to E1. So for star_1, the ratio is n2_1/n1_1 = 2, and for star_2, it's n2_2/n1_2 = let's say r. Wait, but the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps n2_1/n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2). Or maybe the excitation per atom is twice as high, so the ratio is twice as much. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the number in the upper level compared to the lower level. So for star_1, the ratio is twice as much as for star_2. So:

(n_upper/n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper/n_lower)_2.

Wait, but the question says "twice as excited", so perhaps star_1 has more atoms in the excited state. So their ratio is higher. So for star_1, the ratio is higher. So if star_2 has a ratio r, then star_1 has 2r.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, the problem states that star_1's atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So:

(n_upper/n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper/n_lower)_2.

So for each star, the ratio is determined by the Boltzmann factor: n_upper/n_lower = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

So for star_1, (n_upper_1 / n_lower_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) )

Similarly, for star_2, (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

But according to the problem, the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

Wait, but wait, because a higher ratio (n_upper/n_lower) implies that more atoms are in the upper level, which would mean higher excitation. So if star_1 has a higher ratio, then ΔE/(k T_1) is smaller than ΔE/(k T_2), which would mean T_1 is larger than T_2.

Wait, but let's think about the Boltzmann factor. The exponent is negative, so if the temperature increases, the exponent becomes less negative. So exp(-x) is smaller when x is larger. So for a higher temperature, (n_upper/n_lower) is larger, because ΔE/(k T) is smaller, so -ΔE/(k T) is less negative, so exp is larger.

So if star_1 has a higher ratio than star_2, then T_1 must be higher than T_2.

Now, let's set up the equation. Let me denote the ratio as R1 and R2.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me write this equation:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Simplify:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = - ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2 )

Bring terms with T to one side:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] = ln(2)

Hmm, but wait, I can factor this as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Because 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but wait, let me think about the signs. Because ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), and T2 and T1 are temperatures, so positive. So the equation becomes:

(ΔE)/(k) * ( (T2 - T1) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

But wait, the problem says that star_1 is twice as excited. That would mean T1 > T2, because higher temperature leads to higher excitation. So T2 - T1 would be negative. So the left side would be (positive) * (negative)/(positive) ) = negative. But the right side is ln(2), which is positive. That can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Let me re-examine the earlier steps. I assumed R1 = 2 R2, which led to the equation leading to a negative on the left.

Wait, perhaps I should have set R1 = 2 R2 as:

R1 = (n_upper_1/n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2/n_lower_2) = 2 R2.

But according to the equation, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2 R2.

So taking ln:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln(R2) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Which rearranged to:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2 )

Which is:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

So,

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

[ ΔE/(k) ] * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

Now, let's rearrange this equation.

Multiply both sides by (T1 T2)/(ΔE/k):

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * (T1 T2) * (k/ΔE )

Wait, but perhaps I can express the equation as:

(ΔE)/(k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Wait, but let me think about what the options are. The options involve expressions like ln(2) equals some ratio of temperatures.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but looking at what we have:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE / k ) (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, but in our equation, the left side is ln(2), and the right side has (ΔE/k) times (T1-T2) over (T1 T2). So unless ΔE/k is 1, which I don't think it is, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should consider what the problem is saying. The question gives the energy difference ΔE, but in the options, they're giving expressions without involving ΔE. So perhaps the ratio T1 and T2 can be expressed in terms that cancel ΔE.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

The initial equation we have is:

(ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2

Hmm, but the options don't have ΔE or k in them. So perhaps the way I'm approaching this is incorrect.

Wait, let me consider taking the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors. Because for star 1 and star 2, their R1 and R2 are given.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the ratio of R1 to R2 is 2, since R1 = 2 R2.

So,

R1 / R2 = 2

Which is:

[exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = 2

Simplify:

exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

Wait, same as before.

Hmm, but the options are giving ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2 without any other constants. So perhaps the equation is being rewritten to express ln(2) as some function of T1 and T2.

Wait, let's rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2).

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

But none of the options have ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is giving me the energy difference and I can compute the ratio of temperatures based on that. But the options don't include ΔE. So perhaps the equation simplifies.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the value of ΔE. It's given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait! 1.38 is approximately Boltzmann's constant k. Because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is approximately k times 1 eV? Or wait, no, because 1.38e-23 J is k.

So, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J ≈ k * 1 K.

Wait, because k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So if ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, then ΔE = k * (1 K). So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Ah! So substituting ΔE = k * (1), so ΔE = k.

So in the equation:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

Substituting ΔE/(k) = 1:

ln(2) = (1 * (T1 - T2)) / (T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches our derived equation.

So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we start by analyzing the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. This implies that the ratio of the populations of the upper energy level to the lower energy level is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the population ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, we denote the population ratios as \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), respectively. According to the problem, \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the Boltzmann factor for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Note that \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is approximately equal to \( k \) (since \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)). Thus, \( \Delta E / k \approx 1 \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
