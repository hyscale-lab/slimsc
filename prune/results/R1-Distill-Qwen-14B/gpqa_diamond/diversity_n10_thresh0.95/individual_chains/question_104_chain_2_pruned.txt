Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

The question states that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the stars are identical in mass, and the planets are similar in mass too.

The key data here are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what these shifts mean. Oh right, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = (v) where v is the star's velocity. The shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity—since wavelength shift is calculated using the Doppler effect formula.

I think the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So, the velocity v can be found by v = (delta_lambda) / (lambda) * c. But since both measurements are using the same spectral line, the lambda is the same for both. So the ratio of their velocities (v1 and v2) would be the same as the ratio of their shifts (5 and 7). So v2 = (7/5) * v1.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the orbit. The formula I remember is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/( (1-e²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (P * (1 day) )^(1/3) * (2π) ). But since e is zero (circular orbit) and i is 90 degrees (edge-on, which gives sin i =1), this simplifies a bit.

But wait, perhaps there's a simpler way. Since the masses of the stars are the same and the planet masses are similar to Neptune, we can consider M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the same for both stars. So, the semi-amplitude K depends on M_p and inversely on the square root of the orbital period P. Or wait, no, let me think. The formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_* is much larger than M_p, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_* )^(2/3) )

Wait, but in this case, M_p is the same for both planets (similar to Neptune), and M_* is the same for both stars (same as Sun). So K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Alternatively, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)).

Wait, because K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity, and it's proportional to (v) = (2π a) / (P) * (M_p / M_*) ), but a is the semi-major axis, which relates to the period via Kepler's third law.

Wait, maybe it's easier to approach through Kepler's third law. The period P is related to the semi-major
