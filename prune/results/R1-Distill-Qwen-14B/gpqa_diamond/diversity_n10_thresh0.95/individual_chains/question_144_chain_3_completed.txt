Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a meson resonance called X. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I get tau (the lifetime) from the given width Γ_X? Oh right! The uncertainty principle comes into play here. The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / tau, so tau ≈ ħ / Γ. 

Wait, but I should double-check the exact formula. Oh right, the natural line width formula says Γ = ħ / tau. So tau is ħ divided by Γ.

But Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. Let me make sure about the units. Let me convert everything to consistent units. Hmm, let's think in terms of natural units where ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm and c is 3e8 m/s. Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

First, compute the proper lifetime tau of the meson X. The formula is tau = ħ / Γ. But let me make sure about the units. ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV, and 1 GeV is 1.6e-10 J. Hmm, maybe I should convert Γ into GeV to match the units.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Γ. Let me compute that:

tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, that seems really small. Okay, but that's the proper lifetime. Now, I need to find the mean decay length, which is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), but wait, E is the total energy, which is given as 8 GeV. So gamma = E / (m c²). Wait, but in natural units where c=1, it's E = gamma m. So gamma = E_X / m_X. Because E is the total energy, which is gamma m c², but when c=1, it's gamma m.

So, gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, but beta is v/c, so beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Since gamma is about 6.6667, which is greater than 1, beta would be sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667)^2)).

Let me compute that. 6.6667 squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444. 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1-0.0225=0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, alternatively, more accurately, 6.6667 is 20/3. So 1/(20/3)^2 = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is about 0.9887.

Now, putting this together, gamma is 6.6667, beta is approximately 0.9887.

So the mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

Let me compute each part. c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So let me compute gamma * beta first. 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's see: 6.6667 * 0.9887.

I can approximate this as 6.6667 * (1 - 0.0113) ≈6.6667 - (6.6667 *0.0113).

6.6667 *0.0113 ≈ 0.0753. So 6.6667 -0.0753 ≈6.5914.

So gamma * beta ≈6.5914.

Now, multiply by c: 3e8 m/s.

Wait, but let me compute L step by step. L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

So, let's compute each factor.

gamma * beta = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈6.5914.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So, putting it all together:

L = 6.5914 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5914 *3e8 = 1.9774e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9774 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Let me compute 1.9774 *2.056875.

Hmm, 2 *2 is 4, but let me compute accurately.

1.9774 *2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 1.9774 = 3.9548, and 0.056875 *1.9774 ≈ 0.11155. So total ≈ 3.9548 + 0.11155 ≈4.06635.

So, 4.06635e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

That's very close. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure.

First, Gamma is 0.32 GeV, right? Because 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Tau calculation: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666666...

Beta: sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667)^2)).

(6.6667)^2 is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

1/(44.4444) ≈0.0225. So 1-0.0225=0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. So beta is 0.9887.

Gamma * beta is 6.6667 *0.9887 ≈6.5914.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L =6.5914 *3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute 6.5914 *3e8 = 1.97742e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.97742e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97742 * 2.056875) *1e(9-24) = (approx 4.0663) * 1e-15 m.

So 4.0663e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but let me make sure about the calculation of gamma * beta.

Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation of beta would change things a bit.

Let me compute beta more accurately.

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So 1/gamma² = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma² = 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775 is:

sqrt(0.9775) = ?

Well, 0.98^2 = 0.9604. 0.988^2 = (0.98 +0.008)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144.

Hmm, 0.976144 is less than 0.9775.

What about 0.9887? Let's compute 0.9887^2.

Compute 0.9887 *0.9887:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0087 = 2 *0.008526 = 0.017052.

0.0087^2 = 0.00007569.

Sum: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 ≈0.9775277.

Which is very close to 0.9775.

So 0.9887^2 ≈0.9775277, which is slightly above 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775)=approx 0.9887, which is what we have.

So beta is 0.9887, and gamma*beta is 6.6667 *0.9887≈6.5914.

So all the calculations seem correct.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.066e-15 m, which matches option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more precise way to compute beta without approximating.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately.

Wait, another approach: beta = sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2 )

Because, since E = gamma m c², and in natural units, E = gamma m, so gamma = E/m.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)), which is sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2).

So, m_X=1.2 GeV, E_X=8 GeV.

So m/E = 1.2 /8 = 0.15.

So 1 - (0.15)^2 = 1 -0.0225=0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, same as before.

So beta is 0.9887.

So gamma * beta = (E/(m)) * beta = (8/1.2) * 0.9887 ≈6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈6.5914.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Now, let me compute tau again. Tau is ħ/(Γ).

But wait, I think we have a potential unit confusion here.

Wait, when I'm using ħ in units of GeV·s, and Γ is in GeV, then tau is in seconds.

Wait, so ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So, L = 6.5914 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 6.5914 *3e8 = 1.97742e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 1.97742e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97742 *2.056875) * 1e-15 m.

Compute 1.97742 *2.056875.

Hmm,

1.97742 * 2 = 3.95484.

1.97742 *0.056875 = let's compute 0.056875 is approximately 0.056875 = 56875/1e6 = 0.056875.

So 1.97742 * 0.056875 = approximately 0.11155.

Adding to 3.95484 gives 3.95484 + 0.11155 = 4.06639.

So 4.06639e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.066e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is extremely close. Probably due to more precise calculations, the value is a bit lower.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light (\( v/c \)),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Proper Lifetime (\( \tau \))
The proper lifetime is related to the particle's width (\( \Gamma \)) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}
\]

Given:
- \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),

we calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Velocity Factor (\( \beta \))
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Mean Decay Distance (\( L \))
Substituting into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Given:
- \( \gamma \beta \approx 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5914 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = 6.5914 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, compute \( 6.5914 \times 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.5914 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.97742 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Next, multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.97742 \times 10^9 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = (1.97742 \times 2.056875) \times 10^{-15}.
\]

Compute \( 1.97742 \times 2.056875 \):

\[
1.97742 \times 2.056875 \approx 4.06639.
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 4.06639 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The closest option to \( 4.06639 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**Option B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
