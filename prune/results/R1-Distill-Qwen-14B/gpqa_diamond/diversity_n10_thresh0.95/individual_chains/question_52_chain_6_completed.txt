Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked and how to approach it.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain properties. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on the surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of around 1448 Å, and we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I don't have to worry about other factors like non-LTE effects.

Hmm, okay, so I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of different energy levels in a gas. The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when there's no spot (6000 K). So the ratio n1/n2 (or whatever) is lower when T is lower. That suggests that the ratio is dependent on temperature in a way that when T goes down, the ratio goes down. So what does that mean about the energy levels?

Let me think about the Boltzmann factor. The exponential term is exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is E2 - E1. If E2 > E1, then the ratio n2/n1 would be proportional to exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)). So as temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, meaning the ratio n2/n1 decreases. So if the ratio observed is n1/n2, which would be (1/(n2/n1)), then a lower n2/n1 would mean a higher n1/n2. Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, maybe I should clarify what exactly the ratio is.

The problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So, ratio = n1/n2. When T is lower (spots present), n1/n2 is lower than when T is higher (no spots). So when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. That would imply that the lower level (level 1) is the higher energy level. Because if n1 is the lower energy level, then increasing T would make more atoms go to higher energy states, so n1 would decrease and n2 would increase, making n1/n2 decrease. Wait, no, the higher energy level is level 2. So level 1 is lower energy.

Wait, wait, maybe I should set this up more clearly. Let me denote:

Let’s say level 1 is energy E1, level 2 is E2, with E2 > E1.

The Boltzmann ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)).

So if T decreases, the exponential becomes smaller. So n2/n1 decreases. So n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would increase. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Hmm, that contradicts what I just thought. So perhaps I have the energy levels reversed.

Wait, maybe level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. That would mean E1 > E2.

Then, the ratio n2/n1 would be (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)) which is actually (g2/g1) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) ).

So as T decreases, the exponent (E1-E2)/(k T) increases because denominator is smaller. So the exponential term increases, making n2/n1 larger. Then, n1/n2 would be 1/(n2/n1), so it would decrease. Which aligns with the problem's statement that when Teff decreases (spots present), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases.

Wait, okay, that makes sense. So level 1 is higher energy than level 2. But wait, no, because in that case, when T increases, more atoms would be in higher energy levels. So, for example, if level 1 is higher, higher T would increase the population of level 1. Which would make n1/n2 (since n2 is lower energy) increase. Hmm, but in the problem, when T decreases, n1/n2 = ratio decreases. So perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just define the ratio as n1/n2, where level 1 is the lower energy level and level 2 is higher. Then, under higher temperature T, the ratio n1/n2 would be higher because the population in level 2 is higher, so n2 is higher, making the ratio lower. Wait, no, if T is higher, more atoms are in higher energy states, so n2 increases. So n1/n2 would decrease. So, when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 goes down. Which is consistent with the problem's observation that when T is lower (spots), the ratio is lower. Wait, no, the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present (lower T). Wait, if when T is higher (no spots), the ratio should be lower, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me restate. The ratio (n1/n2) is lower when the star has spots (lower Teff). So when Teff is lower, the ratio is lower. So that implies that when Teff is higher, the ratio is higher. So n1/n2 is proportional to exp(- (E2-E1)/(k T)). Because the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ). Wait, wait, let's write it correctly.

The Boltzmann distribution is n_i /n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Assuming E_i is the energy of level i, and E_j is level j.

So, if we're looking at n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Let's say E2 > E1, so E1 - E2 is negative. So the exponent becomes positive, so exp( positive number ). So, if E2 > E1, then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait: (E1 - E2) is negative, so -(E1 - E2) is positive. Right.

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, as T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is divided by a larger number, so the value decreases. So exp(...) decreases. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases, since the exponential term is getting smaller.

Wait, but in our problem, when T decreases (spots present), n1/n2 is lower. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. That would mean that the ratio decreases when T decreases. But according to the equation, n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) becomes larger (since T is in denominator), so exponent increases, so exp is bigger. So n1/n2 would increase. But in the problem, the ratio decreases when T is lower.

Hmm, that's a contradiction. So perhaps I have the energy levels the other way around.

Wait, maybe level 1 is higher energy than level 2. So E1 > E2.

Then, E1 - E2 is positive. So the exponent is [ -( (E1 - E2) ) / (k T) ) ] = -(positive)/(k T) = negative.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which is (g1/g2) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) )

So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative (because T is in the denominator), so exp becomes bigger (approaching 1 as T increases), so n1/n2 increases.

Wait, but if E1 is higher, then when T is higher, more atoms are in higher energy states (E1), making n1 higher, so n1/n2 would increase. Which is what we have.

But in the problem, when T decreases (spots present), n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, so when T decreases, the exponent -(ΔE)/(k T) becomes more negative, so exp(...) becomes smaller, so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ... ) becomes smaller. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 (g1/g2 * exp(...)) would decrease. Which aligns with the problem statement that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

So, okay, so level 1 has higher energy than level 2. So E1 > E2.

So the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ).

So, the key is to find the ratio of the two ratios: when the star doesn't have spots (Teff = 6000 K) divided by when it does have spots (Teff = 5500 K).

The question is: what is the factor by which this ratio changes? So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000K / (n1/n2)_5500K.

Let me compute this factor.

So,

Factor = [ (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k * 5500) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out.

So,

Factor = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k * 6000) + (E1 - E2)/(k * 5500) )

Factor = exp[ (E1 - E2)/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ]

Let me compute the exponent.

Compute (1/5500 - 1/6000):

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 (because 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818)

1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4

Difference is ≈ 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 ≈ 0.00001513, which is 1.513e-5.

So,

Exponent = (E1 - E2)/(k) * (1.513e-5 )

But E1 - E2 is the energy difference corresponding to the transition wavelength of 1448 Å.

Wait, the transition wavelength λ is 1448 Å. So the energy of the photon emitted when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1 (since E1 > E2) is E_photon = hc/λ.

Let me compute E_photon.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So,

E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So,

E_photon = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, E_photon is the energy difference between the two levels: E1 - E2 = E_photon, since the transition is from higher to lower energy, emitting a photon of energy E_photon.

So, E1 - E2 = 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, let me compute that again more accurately.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) * 1e-15.

1.9878 / 1448 ≈ approx 1.373e-3.

So, 1.373e-3 * 1e-15 = 1.373e-18 J.

So E_photon ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But I need to find E1 - E2 in terms of eV or some other unit compatible with Boltzmann's constant, which is usually in eV/K.

Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E_photon is 1.373e-18 J. Let's convert that to eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So,

E_photon (eV) = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.373 / 1.602) * 10 ≈ approximately 8.57 eV.

Wait, let's compute it exactly:

1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 = (1.373 / 0.1602) ) * (1e-18 / 1e-19) ) → 1.373 / 0.1602 ≈ 8.569, and 1e-18/1e-19 is 10. So 8.569 *10 = 85.69 eV. Wait, that can’t be right because 1.373e-18 J is 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 eV = (1.373 / 0.1602) ) * (1e-18 / 1e-19) ) → 1.373 / 0.1602 ≈ 8.569, multiplied by 10 gives 85.69 eV. Hmm, but that seems high because 85 eV is way beyond visible light. Wait, visible light is about 1.5 to 3 eV. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 1448 Å is in the near-ultraviolet or perhaps visible? Let me check: 1000 Å is 100 nm (far UV), 4000 Å is 400 nm (violet). 1448 Å is about 144.8 nm, which is in the extreme ultraviolet. So the photon energy should be higher than visible.

But let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1448e-10 m. So,

E_photon = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So,

E_photon = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373, so 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So,

E_photon (eV) = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.373e-18) / (1.602e-19) ) eV.

Which is (1.373 / 0.1602) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Ah, okay, that's correct. So E_photon is about 8.57 eV. That's a high-energy photon, which makes sense for 144.8 nm (since E=8.57 eV corresponds to λ ≈ 142 nm, so close to 144.8 nm).

So, E_photon = E1 - E2 = 8.57 eV.

Wait, but in our exponent, we have (E1-E2) in J, because k is in J/(K). So let me compute (E1-E2) in J.

E1 - E2 = 8.57 eV * (1.602e-19 J/eV) = 8.57 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 1.373e-18 J, which matches earlier calculation.

So,

Exponent = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) * (1.513e-5 )

Wait, no, let me write it correctly.

The exponent is (E1 - E2)/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

Wait, no, earlier in the factor equation:

Factor = exp[ (E1 - E2)/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ]

Wait, wait, no, the (1/5500 - 1/6000) is positive because 1/5500 is larger than 1/6000. So the exponent is positive.

Wait, let me recompute the exponent step by step.

We have:

Exponent = (E1 - E2) * (1/(k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

= (E1 - E2) * (1/k) * ( (6000 - 5500) ) / (5500 * 6000) )

= (E1 - E2) * (1/k) * (500) / (33,000,000 )

= (E1 - E2) * (500) / (33e6 * k )

Wait, let me compute 500/(33e6) → 500 / 33,000,000 = 5 / 330,000 → ≈ 1.515e-5.

So,

Exponent = (E1 - E2) * (1.515e-5) / k.

Wait, no, I think I missed a step. Let me compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) first.

Compute 1/5500 = approx 0.000181818,

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667,

Difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 = 1.5151e-5.

So,

Exponent = (E1-E2)/(k) * 1.5151e-5.

So,

(E1-E2) is 8.57 eV. Let me compute it in J.

8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.373e-18 J.

So,

Exponent = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) * 1.5151e-5.

Compute 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 → approximately (1.373/1.38) ) * 1e5 → approx 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99500.

Multiply by 1.5151e-5:

99500 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ 99500 * 0.000015151 ≈ roughly 1.507.

So, exponent ≈ 1.507.

So,

Factor = exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507 ≈ Let me compute that.

e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is about 4.953. Let me get a better approximation.

What's e^1.507?

Compute ln(4.5)= approx 1.504. Because ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, ln(4.5)=1.504077396.

Wait, 1.507 is a little higher than 1.504. So e^1.507 ≈ 4.5 * e^(0.003) ≈ 4.5*(1 + 0.003 + 0.003^2/2) → approx 4.5*(1.003 + 0.0000045) ≈ 4.5 * 1.003 ≈ 4.5135.

So, e^1.507 ≈ ~4.51.

Wait, but earlier I estimated the exponent as 1.507, and e^1.507 is about 4.5. So the factor would be approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, let me recompute the exponent.

Compute (E1 - E2) = 8.57 eV = 8.57 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.373e-18 J.

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, (E1 - E2)/(k) = 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) ) * 1e5 → approx 0.995 * 1e5 = 99500 K.

Multiply by (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 1.515e-5.

So 99500 * 1.515e-5 = 99500 * 0.00001515.

Let me compute 99500 * 0.00001515:

99500 * 0.00001 = 0.995.

99500 * 0.00000515 = let's compute 99500 * 5.15e-6.

5.15e-6 is 0.00000515.

99500 * 0.00000515 = 99500 * 5.15e-6.

First, 1e5 * 5.15e-6 = 0.515.

So 99500 is 99.5% of 1e5, so 0.515 * 0.995 ≈ 0.512.

So total is 0.995 + 0.512 = 1.507.

So exponent is 1.507 → e^1.507 ≈ 4.5, as before.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature, $T_{\text{eff}} = 6000$ K) to having spots ($T_{\text{eff}} = 5500$ K). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k T}\right),
\]

where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the statistical weights, $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the levels, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The energy difference between the levels corresponds to the wavelength of the transition, $\lambda = 1448$ Å, which can be converted to energy using $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$.

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference
The energy of the photon corresponding to $\lambda = 1448$ Å is:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
E = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts ($1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}$):

\[
E = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, $E_1 - E_2 = 8.57 \, \text{eV}$.

### Step 2: Compute the ratio of populations
The ratio of populations at two temperatures is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

First, compute the temperature difference term:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Next, compute $\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k}$:

\[
\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} = \frac{8.57 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, compute the exponent:

\[
\text{Exponent} = \frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} \times \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) = 99500 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.507.
\]

Finally, compute the factor:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.507) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star transitions from no spots to having spots is approximately **4.5**.

ANSWER: C
