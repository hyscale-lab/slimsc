Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so that's written in terms of x and y coordinates. I'm trying to remember what kind of geometry this represents. Oh right, metrics can describe different spacetime curvatures. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a type of surface with negative curvature, like a saddle shape.

Pseudosphere usually refers to something with constant negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure how this relates to the metric given. Let me think about the form of the metric. The denominator is 4 minus (x² + y²), so as x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator gets smaller, making the metric components blow up. So the radius of the pseudosphere probably relates to this 4, which is 2 squared. Oh wait, the question mentions radius r=2. So maybe 4 is (2)^2.

Now, the area of a sphere in 2D (which is a circle) would be 4πr², but this is a pseudosphere, which is in a space with negative curvature. Wait, no, pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, so its geometry is different.

Wait, the metric given is in 2D, right? Because it has dx² and dy². So it's a 2-dimensional metric. But wait, a pseudosphere is a 2D surface embedded in 3D, but here we're talking about an abstract 2D space with this metric. So perhaps the question is about the area of a specific region in this space.

Alternatively, maybe the metric is for a 3D spacetime, but the question is about a 2-sphere, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the metric is given in dx² and dy², so it's a 2D metric. So the space described by this metric is a 2D surface.

The question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but this is a metric that might represent the entire space, not just a sphere. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the metric is written in a coordinate system that covers the entire pseudosphere. Let me recall that a pseudosphere would have a metric that's singular at some point, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's a metric that's conformally flat, as it's written in terms of a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So it's conformally equivalent to flat Euclidean space.

In conformal coordinates, the area element would be (g_xy) dx dy, where g_xy is the coefficient in front of dx². So in this case, it's (32)/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA would be (32/(4 - (x² + y²))) dx dy.

So if I want to find the area of the pseudosphere, I think I need to integrate this area element over the appropriate region. But wait, what's the region? The denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which would be zero when x² + y² =4. So the region where x² + y² <4 is allowed, I suppose. Because beyond that, the metric's coefficient becomes negative, which might not make physical sense for a real area element.

Wait, wait, actually, in spacetime metrics, sometimes the signature is important. But here, the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a surface with negative curvature. Hmm, but the metric given is in Euclidean-like terms, so I'm not sure if it's a spacelike or timelike metric.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is written in such a way that the space it describes is a pseudosphere. Let's think about the form. The general form of a metric for a surface of revolution with negative curvature is something like ds² = dr² + (a² / (1 + (r²)/(4a²)))² dθ², but I'm not exactly sure. Or perhaps for hyperbolic space, the metric is ds² = dr² + (a sinh(r/a))² dθ². But this is in polar coordinates, whereas the given metric is in Cartesian coordinates.

Alternatively, considering that the metric is conformally flat, maybe it's representing a hyperbolic plane. The hyperbolic plane has an infinite area, but perhaps when considering a pseudosphere, which is a finite area?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach this step by step. The area of a pseudosphere, as I remember, is a finite area. But wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent, isn't it? Or maybe not. Wait, no, the standard pseudosphere is a surface of finite area but infinite length. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the metric given and what kind of surface it represents. So the metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see, 4 is 2 squared, so r=2 makes sense. So if I consider the denominator as 4 - (x² + y²), the region where x² + y² <4 is allowed. So this is like a disk of radius 2 in these coordinates.

Wait, but the area element is (32)/(4 - (x² + y²)) dx dy. So to find the area, we have to integrate this over x and y. But the region is x² + y² <4. So the area would be the double integral over x² + y² <4 of (32)/(4 - (x² + y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Let me switch to polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator is 4 - r². So the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute that. The integrand is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) ) from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2). Wait, when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral is from u=4 to u=0, which is the same as -∫ from 0 to 4.

So substituting, ∫ (32 * (-1/2)) (1/u) du from 4 to 0 → 32*(-1/2) = -16. So the integral over r becomes ∫ (from u=4 to 0) (1/u) * (-16) du.

Wait, perhaps I should handle the limits more carefully. Let me rewrite the radial integral:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

When r=0 → u=4; when r=2 → u=0.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-1/2) * (1/u) ) ] du.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (4→0) (1/u) du = 32*(-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but 1/u from 4 to 0 is [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] but ln(0) is negative infinity. Oh no, that's a problem because that integral would diverge. Wait, but that can't be right. Because the area of the pseudosphere should be finite.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about the substitution again. So the substitution u = 4 - r². So when r is 2, u is 0, but the denominator becomes zero, which suggests that the area element is getting larger as r approaches 2. But wait, if the integral diverges, that would mean the area is infinite. But that can't be right because the options have 4π(x² + y²), etc.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is the metric actually representing a compact space? Because if the integral diverges, the area would be infinite, which would correspond to option D) +infty.

But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudospheres are models of hyperbolic geometry. But wait, hyperbolic space is of infinite extent and has infinite volume, but a pseudosphere is a specific surface.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Maybe the area is not of the entire space but of a specific region. Or perhaps the metric is such that the area is finite.

Wait, let me think again about the integral. The area element is (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ. So integrating from r=0 to r=2, θ=0 to 2π.

So the radial integral is ∫0^2 (32 * r)/(4 - r²) dr. Let me compute that.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So our integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (32 * (-1/2) / u) du.

Which is ∫ from 4 to 0 of (-16/u) du → which is (-16) ∫ (4→0) (1/u) du = (-16) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, that becomes (-16)( ln(0) - ln(4) ). But ln(0) is -infinity, so (ln(0) - ln(4)) is -infinity - ln(4) = -infinity. So the integral is (-16)(-infinity) = positive infinity. So the area is diverging to infinity.

But that's strange because the options include D) +infty. So is the area infinite? But wait, I thought the pseudosphere had finite area. Hmm, maybe the given metric isn't for the entire pseudosphere but for a portion of it. Or perhaps I got the metric wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for the entire pseudosphere, but when you compute its area, it's infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, the radius being 2 might affect the area. Let me recall the formula for the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and its Gaussian curvature is K = -1/(R^2), where R is the radius of curvature. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula for the area.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of a pseudosphere is 4π R^2, but that's the area of a regular sphere. For a pseudosphere, maybe it's different. Wait, but I think the pseudosphere is a surface of infinite length, so its area would be infinite. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: since the metric's area element is (32)/(4 - r²) r dr dθ, integrating over r from 0 to 2 would involve an integral that diverges at r=2. So the area would be infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the area of the pseudosphere in this metric is infinite.

Wait, but why would the question say radius r=2? Because 4 is 2 squared. So perhaps the region of integration ends at r=2, which is where the denominator becomes zero. So the area is up to r=2, but the integral diverges because the metric blows up there. So the area is infinite.

So the correct answer would be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). 

### Key Observations:
1. The metric is conformally flat, meaning it is related to the Euclidean metric by a scalar function. The area element in this metric is given by:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - (x^2 + y^2)} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

2. The region of integration is defined by the condition \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius \( 2 \) in the \( (x, y) \)-plane. Beyond \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \), the denominator becomes zero, and the metric blows up, making this the boundary of the allowable region.

3. To compute the area, we switch to polar coordinates (\( r, \theta \)) where \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \). The area element becomes:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. The total area is then:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

5. Focusing on the radial integral:
   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr,
   \]
   we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which transforms the integral into:
   \[
   -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
   \]

6. Evaluating this integral:
   \[
   -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[ \ln u \right]_4^0 = -16 \left( \ln 0 - \ln 4 \right).
   \]

   Here, \( \ln 0 \) diverges to \(-\infty\), causing the integral to diverge to \( +\infty \). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.

### Conclusion:
The area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite due to the divergence of the integral at \( r = 2 \).
