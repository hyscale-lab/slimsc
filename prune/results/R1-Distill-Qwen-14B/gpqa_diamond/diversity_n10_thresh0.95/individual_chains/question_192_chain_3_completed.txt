Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, okay, let's try to break it down step by step. I remember that conductors have some specific properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Let me see...

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The cavity isn't at the center; it's shifted by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R, the radius of the conductor. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

So, point P is outside the conductor, right? The distance from the center of the conductor to P is L, and the distance from the cavity's center to P is l. The angle between l and s is theta. Wait, so the cavity is off-center by s, and point P is at some position relative to that.

I remember that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor responds by inducing charges on its inner and outer surfaces. Oh wait, but wait—the conductor was initially uncharged. So, the charges redistribute. The cavity has a charge +q, so the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the conductor was initially neutral. So, that's the first thing to note.

But then, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge as well. Since the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface must have +q because the inner surface has -q. Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is a conductor, so any excess charge resides on the outer surface. But wait, the conductor was uncharged. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface must have -q by induction. That leaves the outer surface with +q, because the total charge of the conductor is the sum of the inner and outer charges. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q.

But wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So any induced charges must be such that the total remains zero. Hmm, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so the sum of the inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, so outer is +q. So the total conductor has a charge of 0, because -q (inner) + q (outer) = 0. That makes sense.

But wait, is the outer surface's charge distribution affected by the charge in the cavity? Because if the cavity isn't at the center, the induced charges on the inner surface won't be symmetric. So the inner surface's charge distribution will be like an induced dipole or something? Or wait, maybe not. The inner surface must exactly cancel the field inside the conductor. So the field due to the inner charge distribution at the conductor's material must be zero.

But for a point outside the conductor, the electric field is due to the outer charges. Because the conductor's material doesn't allow the electric field inside, so the charges on the outer surface are what contribute to the external field.

Wait, but in this problem, the conductor was uncharged, so the outer surface has +q, as the inner has -q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P is due to the outer surface's charge. But what's the distribution of the outer charge?

If the conductor is a sphere, and the outer charge is symmetric, then the electric field outside would be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But wait, in this case, the cavity is off-center. So does that affect the outer charge distribution?

Hmm. Wait, the conductor is a sphere, and the cavity is not at the center. So the charge inside the cavity is +q, and the inner surface of the conductor has -q. But the outer surface has +q. But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface should have a uniform charge distribution, because any external fields would cause charges to move until they're uniformly distributed.

Wait, no. Wait, the field inside the conductor is zero. So the field due to the outer charges must be such that it cancels the field from the inner charges inside the conductor. But for points outside, perhaps the distribution is uniform because of the spherical symmetry.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform regardless of the inner charge. So when you have a charge inside a cavity, the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere. Wait, no, that's not correct. The outer surface's charge distribution depends on any external fields or asymmetries. But in this case, the only asymmetry is the presence of the charge in the cavity, which is not at the center. So the inner surface has an induced charge of -q, but because the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution is not uniform. However, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform because the conductor as a whole is a sphere. So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, because the outer surface is uniformly charged, the field behaves as if all the charge is at the center.

So, the electric field at point P (which is outside the conductor) is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So, the electric field would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

So, the distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L. So the electric field E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). That's because the field outside a uniformly charged sphere is the same as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/L². So that's one of the choices. But wait, I have to be careful. Because the charge in the cavity is +q, and the outer surface has +q. So the field at P is due to the outer +q.

Wait, but the problem says the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is the distance from the center of the cavity to P. Hmm, but does that affect anything? Because if the outer surface is uniformly charged, the field at P is due to the +q at the center of the conductor, regardless of where the cavity is located.

Wait, but the cavity's position affects the inner charge distribution but not the outer. So the outer charge is uniformly distributed. Therefore, the field at P is the same as if the charge were at the center, regardless of the position of the cavity. So, the answer would be option B.

Wait, but let's think again. Are there any other factors? Because the charge is inside the cavity, which is not at the center, but the conductor's outer surface is symmetric. So when you're outside the conductor, the field is purely due to the outer charge, which is uniformly distributed. So the field would just be q/(4πε₀ L²). So option B would be correct.

But wait, let me look at the other options. Option A is 1/(4πε₀) q/(l - s cosθ)^2. That looks like a formula considering the displacement, maybe treating the charge as a point in a different position. But if the outer charge is uniformly distributed, that shouldn't come into play. Option C has l + s cosθ, which seems similar but with a plus. Option D is 1/(4πε₀) q/l², which would imply the distance is from the cavity's center, but that doesn't make sense because the outer charge is on the conductor's surface.

So, considering all that, the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induction**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor, being a sphere, uniformly distributes the remaining charge $+q$ to maintain symmetry.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor (such as point $P$), the electric field is determined by the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the outer surface is uniformly charged, the field at $P$ is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor. This follows from the principle of superposition and the symmetry of the spherical charge distribution.

3. **Distance and Electric Field**: The distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$ is $L$. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by Coulomb's law:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This formula suggests a dependence on $l - s \cos\theta$, which is incorrect because the outer surface charge distribution is uniform, and the field at $P$ depends only on $L$.
   - **Option B**: This matches the derived formula and correctly accounts for the uniform charge distribution on the outer surface.
   - **Option C**: This formula incorrectly uses $l + s \cos\theta$, which is not relevant to the uniform charge distribution on the outer surface.
   - **Option D**: This formula incorrectly assumes the field depends on $l$, the distance from the center of the cavity to $P$, rather than $L$, the distance from the center of the conductor to $P$.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as the electric field at $P$ is determined by the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface of the conductor.
