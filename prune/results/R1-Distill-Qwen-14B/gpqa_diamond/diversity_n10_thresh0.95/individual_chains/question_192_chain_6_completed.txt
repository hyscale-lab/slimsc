Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's see.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So if I imagine the big sphere, and then a smaller sphere inside it, not exactly at the center but shifted by s. Got it.

Now, there's a positive charge +q placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different formula for E.

Wait, right, conductors in electrostatics. I remember that in a conductor, the charges reside on the surface. And for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But wait, this conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero.

But there's a charge inside the cavity. Oh, right! The method of images says that the presence of a charge inside a cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q to balance.

Wait no, that's for a conductor with charge. Let me think again. The conductor is initially uncharged, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Because the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have +q to balance that. So the inner surface has -q, outer has +q.

But wait, the conductor is conducting, so the charges rearrange. The point is, inside the conductor material, the electric field is zero because it's a conductor. So the field inside conductor material is zero, but what about in the cavity?

So the field outside the conductor (like point P) would be due to the charges on the outer surface, which is +q. Because the outer surface's charge is +q, and the conductor's radius is R, the field outside is as if the charge were at the center. So E at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Wait, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Because the charge distribution on the outer surface is such that it's as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So, yes, the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center.

But wait, wait a second. The conductor is a sphere, and the induced charges: the inner surface will have a charge of -q, and the outer surface +q. The outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so when considering the external field, it's as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

But the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the field at P is (1/(4πε₀))*(+q)/(L²). So the magnitude is that, direction radially outward.

Looking at the options, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). That's what I thought.

But wait, option D is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(l²). So l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity. Hmm, but the field outside the conductor is due to the outer charge, which is at the center of the conductor. So why would l matter?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The point P is outside the conductor, which has radius R. So whether the charge is at the center of the conductor, the field at P depends only on L, the distance from the center of the conductor. So option B is correct.

But wait, why are the other options considering l and theta? Maybe I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, no. The conductor might not be a perfect sphere, but here it's a spherical conductor, so the outer surface is a sphere. The presence of the inner charge only affects the inner surface and the outer surface. The outer surface's charge acts as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor.

So regardless of where the inner charge is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface will have +q, and the field outside is the same as that due to a point charge at the center. So the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²), which is option B.

But wait another thought: the field inside the conductor is zero. The field in the cavity, due to the charge +q, but the conductor's inner surface would have -q. So the field inside the cavity is due to both +q and the induced charges on the inner surface. But when you're outside the conductor, the inner charge and the induced charges (inner and outer) result in the field being only due to the outer charge's +q.

So the answer should be B.

Wait, but why is option D presented as (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l²)? l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. But the conductor's field is due to the outer charge, which is at the conductor's center, not the cavity's center. So unless the conductor's outer charge is not uniformly distributed, which shouldn't be the case because the conductor is spherical. So the outer charge distribution is uniform, so the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center. So L is the distance from the center of the conductor, so E is proportional to 1/L².

So the correct option is B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is uncharged, meaning the total charge on it is zero. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the field inside the conductor material) and $+q$ on the outer surface (to maintain charge neutrality).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface. Since the outer surface has a charge of $+q$, the field at any point outside the conductor behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is a result of the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Field Magnitude**: The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is therefore given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
   This formula depends only on $L$, the distance from the center of the conductor to $P$, and not on $l$ (the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center) or $\theta$ (the angle between $l$ and $s$). This is because the field outside the conductor is due to the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface, which acts as if it were a point charge at the center of the conductor.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends only on $L$, not $l$ or $\theta$.
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived formula $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which is correct.
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Involves $\frac{q}{l^2}$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends on $L$, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
