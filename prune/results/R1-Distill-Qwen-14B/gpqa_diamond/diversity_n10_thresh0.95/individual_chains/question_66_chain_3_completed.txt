Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with certain symmetries.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The possible answers are combinations of these.

Wait, I think I should break down each symmetry to see which ones are required. Let me recall what each symmetry means.

Lorentz symmetry: This includes the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which are rotations and boosts. So any operator in SMEFT must respect this because the Standard Model (SM) itself is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory built from the SM. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). So if Poincare is respected, then Lorentz must also be. But wait, do the SMEFT operators require Poincare symmetry? I'm not so sure. Because SMEFT is constructed from local operators, which I think are built to respect local symmetries. But wait, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it necessarily require Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, which in QFT are about momentum conservation and the theory being invariant under shifting the coordinates. But wait, the SMEFT operators are usually written as local operators, and I think they are constructed to be Lorentz invariant, but I'm not certain about Poincare. But I think that if the theory respects Poincare, then the operators must be Poincare-invariant. But wait, if the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Poincare is a larger symmetry (includes Lorentz and translations), but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe SMEFT doesn't necessarily require Poincare symmetry? Or does it? Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which is built to be Lorentz and gauge invariant. But Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations; I think that because the operators in SMEFT are local, and the Lagrangian is local, then the theory must respect Poincare symmetry. Because any term in the Lagrangian that's not Poincare-invariant would lead to non-local effects, which aren't part of SMEFT. So I think Poincare symmetry (option 2) is also a must. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

CP symmetry: CP stands for charge conjugation and parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general; there are CP-violating terms, like the CKM mechanism. So can SMEFT operators violate CP? Well, the question is about which symmetries must be respected. I think that SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP, depending on the basis you choose. For example, you can write operators that explicitly break CP. So no, CP symmetry (option 3) is not necessarily respected by all operators. So option 3 is not a must.

CPT symmetry: CPT is charge-parity-time reversal. The SM is CPT invariant, right? Because it's a relativistic quantum field theory, and the CPT theorem states that any such theory must be CPT-symmetric. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (option 4). Because SMEFT is a QFT, so it must obey the CPT theorem.

Putting it all together: The operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait—Poincare includes translations. Are the SMEFT operators required to be Poincare-invariant? I think that in effective theories, you construct operators that are local and Lorentz-invariant, which would imply that the Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. Because the action is the integral of the Lagrangian density, which is a scalar under Lorentz transformations and translations. So the action is Poincare-invariant if the Lagrangian is. Therefore, the operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 1 and 2 are both required.

So the correct answer should include 1,2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. So the answer is C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is constructed as a low-energy effective theory of the Standard Model, which is Lorentz-invariant. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, as it is a foundational requirement for the theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a local effective field theory, its operators are constructed to respect local symmetries, including translations. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model already includes CP-violating terms, such as those arising from the CKM mechanism. SMEFT can also include operators that explicitly violate CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory, and SMEFT, being a relativistic quantum field theory, must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination of these symmetries is provided in option **C**.
