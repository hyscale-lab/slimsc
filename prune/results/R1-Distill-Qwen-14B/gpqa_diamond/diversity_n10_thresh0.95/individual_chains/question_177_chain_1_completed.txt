Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, interesting. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so maybe the mass part isn't directly relevant here. I'll keep that in mind but focus on the parts that affect luminosity.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that the wavelength (λ_max) is inversely proportional to the temperature, right? So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Wait, no, because λ_max is the same, so T must be the same for both stars. But wait, is that correct? Because if they're emitting as black bodies, their temperatures determine their peak emission wavelengths. So same λ_max implies same temperature. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. Are the stars' temperatures actually the same? Because if they have different masses and radii, perhaps their luminosities would differ based on other factors. But according to the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same, so that implies same temperature.

So, the stars have the same temperature. Then, what's the formula for luminosity? Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem says that they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I need to compute the ratio L1/L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 (since λ_max is the same), let's plug into the formula.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) ) = ( (1.5 R2 )² * T1⁴ ) / ( R2² * T2⁴ )

But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out.

So that becomes ( (2.25 R2²) ) / ( R2² ) ) = 2.25.

Wait, so the ratio is 2.25. So Star_1's luminosity is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc. So the answer would be A) ~2.25.

Wait, but hold on. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s radial velocity, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the calculation? Hmm.

Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But in this case, the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh, wait, the problem says that the peak wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. But if one is moving towards us or away, that would shift the wavelength we observe.

Wait, but in the problem, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed wavelength is not Doppler shifted. Star_2 has 700 km/s. So perhaps we need to correct for Doppler shift when calculating their temperatures.

Wait, that complicates things. Because if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength would be shifted, but the problem says that the observed λ_max are the same. So we need to take into account the Doppler effect when determining the intrinsic temperature.

Wait, this might change the calculation. Because if Star_2 is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted, but the actual emitted wavelength is different. So the actual temperature of Star_2 would be different, but we observe the same λ_max as Star_1.

Let me think. The observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), using the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Wait, but velocities in km/s are probably non-relativistic, so we can approximate the Doppler shift as (1 + v_r / c), but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, I think for small velocities, the Doppler shift can be approximated as delta lambda over lambda is approximately v_r / c. But in this problem, Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s. Let me check what 700 km/s is in terms of the speed of light (c ≈ 3e5 km/s). So 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333, which is about 0.23% of the speed of light. So it's a small velocity, so non-relativistic approximation should be okay.

So for non-relativistic Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer (if positive), or away (if negative). Wait, but the formula depends on whether the source is moving towards or away. If the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift), so v_r would be negative.

In the problem, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit = same as λ1.

Star_2 has v_r = +700 km/s, which is moving away (since radial velocity is positive if moving away, I think). Wait, but wait, the sign convention can vary. Let me clarify: in Doppler shift, if the source is moving towards the observer, v_r is negative, and the observed wavelength is shorter. If moving away, v_r is positive, and λ_obs is longer.

Wait, let's get this right. The Doppler formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c). So for Star_2, which has v_r = +700 km/s, it's moving away, so λ_obs is longer.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So Star_1 has λ1_obs = λ1_emit. Star_2 has λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c). But λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c).

So λ2_emit = λ1_emit / (1 + v_r2 / c).

But according to Wien's law, λ_max = b / T. So λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So T2 is higher than T1 because (1 + v_r2/c) is greater than 1.

Wait, because Star_2 is moving away? Let me double-check.

Wait, if a star is moving away, light is redshifted. So the observed wavelength is longer, which means λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). So if λ_obs is the same as Star_1's λ_emit, then λ_emit of Star_2 must be smaller. Because Star_2's λ_emit is λ_obs / (1 + v/c). So if λ_obs is same as Star_1's λ_emit, then Star_2's λ_emit is less.

Wait, but T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So if λ_emit of Star_2 is smaller, that means T2 is higher than T1. Because T ∝ 1/λ_max.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But wait, v_r2 is positive, so (1 + v_r2/c) is about 1 + 700/(3e5) ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1. So now, when I compute the luminosity ratio, I can't assume T1 = T2. Hmm, that changes everything.

Wait, so the initial assumption that T1 = T2 was wrong because of the Doppler shift. Oh man, I completely forgot about that. So I need to re-calculate considering the Doppler shift.

So let me redo the analysis.

First, the observed λ_max for both stars are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

For Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_emit = b / T1.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c ) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Set equal: λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Substitute λ1_emit = b/T1, λ2_emit = b/T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2,

T2/(T1) = 1 + v_r2/c

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1.

Now, back to luminosity. The luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

So the ratio L1/L2 is:

(L1/L2) = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1² = (2.25) R2².

So,

(L1/L2) = [ (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 ] / [ R2² * T2^4 ]

The R2² cancels out.

So,

(L1/L2) = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But from earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ) → T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/(3e5) )

Calculate 700/(3e5) → 700 / 300,000 → 0.002333...

So, (1 + 700/(3e5)) ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.002333 → T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

Wait, no. Let's express T1 in terms of T2.

Wait, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1^4 = [ T2 / (1 + v_r2/c ) ]^4

So,

T1^4 / T2^4 = [1/(1 + v_r2/c )]^4.

Substitute into L1/L2 ratio:

(L1/L2) = 2.25 * [ 1/(1.002333)^4 ]

Compute (1.002333)^4.

Since 1.002333 is a small increment, we can approximate (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x for small x. Here, x=0.002333.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4 * 0.002333 = 1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332.

Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation is better.

But let me compute (1.002333)^2 first.

(1.002333)^2 = 1.002333 * 1.002333.

Let me compute:

(1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ approximately 1.00467144.

Then, square that again to get (1.002333)^4.

(1.00467144)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2 → 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182 ≈ 1.0093647.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So,

[1/(1.002333)^4 ] ≈ 1 / 1.009365 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

(L1/L2) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.9907.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.001575 ≈ 2.229075.

But wait, I think perhaps I should compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Let me think differently. Compute 1/1.009365:

1.009365 is approximately 1.009365.

Compute 1/1.009365:

Approximate using the first few terms of the expansion 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x³ + ... where x = 0.009365.

x = 0.009365.

So,

1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - 0.009365 + (0.009365)^2 - (0.009365)^3.

Calculate each term:

1 = 1.

-0.009365 = -0.009365.

(0.009365)^2 = approx (9.365e-3)^2 = 87.7e-6 → 0.0000877.

(0.009365)^3 ≈ (9.365e-3)^3 ≈ 8.23e-7 → 0.000000823.

So,

1 - 0.009365 = 0.990635.

Plus 0.0000877 → 0.9907227.

Minus 0.000000823 → 0.990721877.

So, approx 0.9907219.

So,

(L1/L2) = 2.25 * 0.9907219 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 * 0.9907219.

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007219 = ?

Wait, 2.25 * 0.0007219 ≈ 0.001624275.

So total is 2.2275 + 0.001624275 ≈ 2.229124.

Approximately 2.229.

So the ratio is about 2.229. Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.229 is very close to 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier when I thought the Doppler shift didn't matter, I thought the ratio was 2.25. But when considering the Doppler effect, the ratio is about 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but did I make a mistake in the Doppler shift consideration? Because initially, I thought the temperatures would be the same, but because of the Doppler effect, the actual temperatures are different.

So, the correct calculation requires taking into account that the observed wavelengths are the same, leading to different temperatures. Therefore, the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the radii
The problem states that \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Substituting this into the ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}
\]

### Step 2: Relating the temperatures
The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, meaning the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are equal. Using Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\)) and the Doppler shift formula, the intrinsic temperatures (\(T_1\) and \(T_2\)) are related as:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Here, \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) for Star_2, and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\). Substituting:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + 0.002333) \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333}
\]

### Step 3: Substituting into the luminosity ratio
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4
\]

Using the approximation \((1 + x)^n \approx 1 + nx\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.002333\):

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4 \cdot 0.002333 = 1.009332
\]

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx \frac{1}{1.009332} \approx 0.9907
\]

Substituting this into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with the options
The calculated ratio is approximately \(2.229\), which is closest to option **D (~2.23)**.

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.

**Answer: D**
