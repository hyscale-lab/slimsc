Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about comparing the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting a star versus the variation caused by star spots. The scenario is that a star with the same radius as the Sun has a hemisphere covered in dark spots. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Only one hemisphere has these spots, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness changes that might mimic a planet's transit.

The question is, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve (if there were no spots), what would be the radius of an exoplanet relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar)?

The options are A to D, with various fractions.

Hmm. So I think I need to compare the relative change in brightness when either a planet transits or when a spot is visible.

First, let's think about the transit method for detecting exoplanets. When a planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. So the formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because the area is πRp² / πRstar², so the square of the ratio.

But in this problem, the spots are causing a variation. So I need to compute the amplitude of this variation and set it equal to the planet's transit amplitude.

Wait, the star has spots that are cooler. So when the spots are facing us, the total brightness of the star decreases because the spots, being cooler, emit less light.

So the variation in brightness comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. But the question says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude (the change in brightness) caused by the spots is similar to that caused by a planet.

So we need to calculate the brightness variation due to the spots and set it equal to the variation due to the planet, then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, the star's total brightness without any spots would be based on its effective temperature. But when spots are present, the observed brightness changes.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20%, which means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, but since the star is a sphere, the hemisphere that's spotted covers half the star's surface. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) because each hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the contribution of the spots to the total flux.

The flux from the star when spots are on the visible side would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the change in flux when the spots rotate into view. Since the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere, the maximum change would be when the spots are fully facing us, right?

Wait no, because the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, which is 20% of half the star's surface.

Wait, the total surface area of the star is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the area of the star that's covered by spots when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is 0.4πR². But when the star rotates, only part of the spots are visible, so the change in flux depends on the fraction of the spotted area that is visible.

Wait, actually, the hemisphere is the entire area of the star that's visible at any time. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere may come into view, and the unspotted (normal) hemisphere may come into view.

Wait, no. The star's surface is a sphere. If the spots are on one hemisphere, then when the star rotates, we can see that hemisphere only when it's facing us. So when the spot hemisphere is visible, the spots contribute less flux than the surrounding areas.

But how does this affect the observed flux over time?

I think the approach is to compute the difference in flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible compared to when it's not. But since the star is being observed over time, the variation arises as the spotted area comes into view.

Wait, the problem says that the star is being observed, and the variations are due to rotational modulation. So the brightness change would be periodic as the star rotates, with the spots causing a dip in brightness when they're in view.

So the maximum decrease in flux occurs when the largest area of spots is observed. The minimum would be when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is in view.

Wait, but the star's total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the spotted part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the contrast. The normal (unspotted) part of the star emits at T_eff = 6000 K, and the spots are at 5000 K.

So the flux from the spotted areas is lower. The total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible includes both the unspotted and spotted regions of that hemisphere.

So the flux without any spots (F0) is the total flux from the star's surface, which is for a blackbody: F0 = σT^4 * (4π R²) / (4π D²) ) → simplifies to σT^4 (R²/D²), but since we're comparing relative changes, perhaps we can ignore the distance D.

Wait, but when calculating the relative brightness change, maybe we can express it as a ratio.

The total flux when the spots are visible (F_spots) would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted part of the hemisphere (which is 80% of the hemisphere) plus the flux from the spotted part (20% of the hemisphere).

Wait, the hemisphere's total area is 2π R². The spotted part is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The unspotted part is 1.6 π R².

So the flux from the unspotted part is (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

The flux from the spotted part is (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is F_spots = F_unspotted_hemi + F_spots_hemi.

Wait no, the spotted hemisphere is facing us, so the entire hemisphere is either spotted or unspotted. Wait no, the filling factor is 0.2, so 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. So the flux from that hemisphere is (0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4) + (0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4).

Wait, the star's entire surface consists of two hemispheres: the spotted one (with 20% filled) and the unspotted one. But when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is visible, including the spots. When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side and don't contribute to the flux we see.

Wait, actually, no. The star is a sphere. Each hemisphere (the front and the back) is always present, but only the front hemisphere is visible. So when the star is in a certain orientation, the front hemisphere includes the spots. The other hemisphere is the back, which is not visible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the star as having two regions: the spotted hemisphere, which is 20% covered by spots, and the unspotted hemisphere (the other 80% of the star's surface is unspotted? No, wait, the star's surface may have spots only on one hemisphere, so the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted.

Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spotted hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots, and the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see 20% of that hemisphere covered by spots. So the flux we receive is:

The spotted hemisphere's flux is:

(0.2 * area of hemisphere) * σ T_spot^4 + (0.8 * area of hemisphere) * σ T_star^4

The unspotted hemisphere's flux (when it's facing us) is:

100% of the hemisphere area * σ T_star^4.

But wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire other hemisphere is unspotted, so the flux is just the area of that hemisphere times T^4.

But when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is the contribution from the unspotted part of that hemisphere plus the spotted part.

So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

The change in flux (delta F) is F_max - F_min.

Wait, no. The maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is entirely visible. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is visible, which has both the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the spotted parts.

So the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (F_unspotted) is (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible (F_spotted), it's (0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 ) + (0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 )

Because in the spotted hemisphere, 80% is unspotted, and 20% is spotted.

So the difference in flux is F_unspotted - F_spotted, which is:

2π R² σ (6000^4) - [ (0.8*2π R² σ 6000^4 ) + (0.2*2π R² σ 5000^4 ) ]

= 2π R² σ [6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) ]

Let me factor this out:

= 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 (1 - 0.8) - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ * 0.2 [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

So the delta F is 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the spots come into view, so the flux varies between F_unspotted and F_spotted. So the amplitude of the variation is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted × 100% in relative terms. Or actually, the change in brightness is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, no. The maximum brightness is F_unspotted, and when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted. So the change in brightness is F_unspotted - F_spotted, but to find the fractional change, we compute (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Alternatively, the amplitude A is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

So let's compute that.

A = [ (F_unspotted - F_spotted) ] / F_unspotted

= [ (2π R² σ 6000^4) - (0.8 *2π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.2*2π R² σ 5000^4) ) ] / (2π R² σ 6000^4)

Simplify numerator:

= 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 (1 -0.8) - 0.2*5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 *6000^4 -0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So numerator is 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Denominator is 2π R² σ 6000^4.

So A = (0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (6000^4 )

Simplify:

= 0.2 * [ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 ]

= 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333333.

So (5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.103549.

So the fractional change A is about 10.35% when the spots are visible.

Wait, that's a significant dip. So when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is about 10.35% less than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.

But wait, the problem states that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the variation caused by the planet transit should be the same as this 10.35% dip.

Wait, no. Wait, the planet would cause a dip when it transits, which is when it's in front of the star. The dip in brightness is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, so the amplitude (A_planet) is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We found that the amplitude due to the spots is approximately 0.1035 (or 10.35%). So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

Wait, wait. No, wait a second. Because when the planet transits, it blocks some of the light. The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 because it's the area blocked. So the dip is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So we have (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.1035.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close to this value. So the answer would be D.

But wait, let me recheck my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake in calculating the amplitude.

Because the dip in brightness due to spots is only when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. But the star is rotating, so the dip is periodic, but perhaps not as deep as the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the fractional change. Let me go through that again.

Compute (5/6)^4: 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

0.2 * 0.517747 = 0.1035494, so approximately 0.1035.

So the fractional change is about 10.35%. So the amplitude is 10.35%.

Wait, but the planet's transit would have an amplitude of (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

So the answer should be D) ~0.32.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when the star is rotating, the spots come into view as the star spins, which would cause a sinusoidal variation in brightness, not a square wave. But in any case, the amplitude would be the maximum dip, which is 10.35% of the star's total flux.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the flux change. Let me re-express the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible as a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas.

The flux from the unspotted part of the hemisphere is 0.8 * 2π R² * σ T^4.

The flux from the spotted part is 0.2 * 2π R² * σ (T_spot)^4.

The total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the sum of these two.

But the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is 2π R² * σ T^4.

The difference in flux is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

So F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4

F_spotted = [0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 ] + [0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

So, F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2π R² σ [6000^4 - (0.8*6000^4 +0.2*5000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 (1 - 0.8) - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2*6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So the relative change is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

= [0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ 2π R² σ 6000^4 ]

= 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4

= 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Which is the same as before.

So the amplitude is 10.35% as before.

So the planet's transit must block 10.35% of the star's light.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, so 0.32.

Looking at the options, D is ~0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach would be to compute the flux from the star when the spots are present and when they're not, and then find the relative change.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the contrast between the spots and the surrounding areas.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the spot coverage is on a hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness. The maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is visible, but the star's rotation might cause a sinusoidal variation, but the amplitude would still be the maximum dip.

Wait, but perhaps I should model the problem differently. For example, when a spot is on the limb, we see only a fraction of it, but when it's in the center, we see the full spot. But in this problem, because the star is rotating, the spots are moving in and out of view, so the maximum dip is when the maximum area of the spots is visible. But perhaps the scenario is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, causing the dip. But when the star rotates 180 degrees, the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, with maximum brightness.

So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Which we've already computed as about 10.35%.

So the planet's transit would cause a dip of the same amplitude, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217 → 0.32.

So the answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we compare the amplitude of the light curve caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius ($R_{\star}$).  
   - The effective temperature of the star is $T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}$.  
   - The spots are cooler, with $T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K}$.  
   - The filling factor of the spots is 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots.

2. **Flux Contributions**:  
   - The total flux from the star without spots is proportional to its surface area and temperature:  
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 4\pi R_{\star}^2
     \]  
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is the sum of contributions from the unspotted and spotted regions:  
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \sigma \left( 0.8 \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 2\pi R_{\star}^2 + 0.2 \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4 \cdot 2\pi R_{\star}^2 \right)
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation**:  
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in flux:  
     \[
     A = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}
     \]  
   - Substituting the flux expressions:  
     \[
     A = 1 - \frac{0.8 \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.2 \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]  
   - Simplifying:  
     \[
     A = 1 - 0.8 - 0.2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4
     \]  
     \[
     A = 0.2 \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]  
   - Compute $(5/6)^4$:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.482253
     \]  
   - Substituting:  
     \[
     A \approx 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.482253) = 0.2 \cdot 0.517747 \approx 0.1035
     \]  
   - Thus, the amplitude is approximately $10.35\%$.

4. **Planet Transit Amplitude**:  
   - The amplitude of a planet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
     \[
     A_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}} \right)^2
     \]  
   - Setting $A_{\text{planet}} = A_{\text{spots}} = 0.1035$:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]  
   - Solving for $\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}}$:  
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
     \]  
   - This rounds to approximately $0.32$.

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**. This corresponds to option **D**.

ANSWER: D
