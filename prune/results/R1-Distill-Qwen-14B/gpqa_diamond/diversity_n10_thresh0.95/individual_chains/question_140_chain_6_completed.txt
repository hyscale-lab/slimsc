--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The problem talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

Hmm, I need to figure out what substance X is. Let's think about what each part means.

First, the reaction of X with Y releases gas W. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So W's molecule has equal neutrons and protons. Let's think of possible gases. CO2 is one, but its molecule has 12 + 16*2 = 44 g/mol. Wait, but for the molecule, each atom contributes protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe W is something like H2O, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, maybe it's NH3, but that's also a liquid under certain conditions. Wait, no, under standard conditions, NH3 is a gas. So let's think about the structure. If W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, each molecule must balance that. For example, if W is H2O: each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons (assuming light isotope), and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule would have (2*1)+(8) protons, and (2*0)+(8) neutrons. So protons: 10, neutrons: 8. Not equal. Hmm. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe W is CO2: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's the common isotope, 12C). Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (16O). So CO2: 6+2*8 = 22 protons; 6 + 2*8=22 neutrons. Oh wait, that would make the molecule have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So same number. So W could be CO2. But wait, CO2 is a gas, yes. But when would a reaction produce CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with acid? Alternatively, perhaps the gas is another molecule.

Wait, another possibility: maybe W is CH4. No, that doesn't fit. Or maybe it's O2 or N2, but those don't have same protons and neutrons per molecule. Alternatively, maybe it's a noble gas, but they're monoatomic, so their protons and neutrons would have to be equal. For example, Argon has 18 protons and 22 neutrons (in its most common isotope), so that's not equal. Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's He-4), so each molecule (He) would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That's equal. So W could be He. But that's a noble gas; when would a violent reaction produce He? Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe W is CO (carbon monoxide). Let's see: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (12C), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO has 14 protons, 14 neutrons. So same number. That fits. So W could be CO.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce W, a gas. So maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. But the product is CO2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is water, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. Then when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Let's think: 277 K is about 4°C, which is close to the melting point of water (0°C), but maybe it's another substance. Wait, perhaps B is a metal. For example, sodium has a melting point around 371 K, potassium around 336 K. Wait, no. Wait, maybe B is a compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a base. Wait, 277 K is 4°C, which is just above the melting point of ice. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid with a low melting point.

Wait, maybe B is a carbonate. Let's think about a reaction where a carbonate is formed as a precipitate, and upon heating, it decomposes. For example, CaCO3 decomposes upon heating to CaO and CO2. But the melting point of CaO is about 2570°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps B is sodium bicarbonate? No, that's about 270 K melting point? Wait, I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe B is another substance. Let's think again.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So when X reacts with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid, which is a keto acid), the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe X is a base. So the reaction could be a neutralization reaction. For example, a carboxylic acid reacting with a base to form a salt and water. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Wait, perhaps the product is an ester? Or a carbonate? Alternatively, maybe the product is a metal carboxylate, which has the formula M(OOCR)2 or something. Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms in the molecule. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, another angle: X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an element with a heavier isotope. For example, maybe X is sodium carbonate. Sodium has isotopes, like 23Na and 25Na. Or maybe X is something else where one element has a heavier isotope, like carbon with 13C, or oxygen with 18O.

But wait, what's a commonly used reagent in organic chemistry that's a carbonate? Sodium carbonate is used as a base in various reactions, like in the bicarbonate extraction method. Alternatively, maybe X is sodium bicarbonate, which is also used in organic reactions. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. If X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce CO2 gas and a salt. For example, if Y is HCl, then X might be Na2CO3. The reaction would be 2HCl + Na2CO3 → 2NaCl + H2O + CO2↑. So G would be NaCl, but that's soluble. Hmm, that's not a precipitate. Wait, maybe Y is a different acid. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, then the reaction would produce CaCl2, H2O, and CO2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, maybe Y is not an acid but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is water, but that seems unlikely for a violent reaction. Alternatively, maybe Y is an alcohol or another reagent. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the substance X. The question says that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Suppose X is a base like NaOH. Then the reaction would be acid + base → salt + water. For example, if the keto acid is RCOOH (carboxylic acid), then the salt would be RCOO^- Na^+. The product would be sodium carboxylate, which has formula NaOOCR. Wait, that has two oxygen atoms from the carboxylate group: O from COO^-, and another O. So each molecule would have two oxygen atoms in the RCOO^- part. So that could fit. So if X is NaOH, then reaction with a carboxylic acid would give the sodium salt, which has two oxygen atoms per formula unit.

Also, NaOH is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So that makes sense. But then, what about the initial reaction with Y?

Wait, X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and upon heating G gives B. Let's think. If X is NaOH, and Y is, say, a carbonate, then the reaction would produce CO2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is ammonium carbonate or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm off track. Let me think about the possible options. The question gives options for the cumulative atomic masses. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the elements in X are sodium and oxygen. Sodium's atomic mass is about 23, oxygen is 16. So 23 + 16 = 39, but that's not in the options. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe X is something else.

Wait, another angle: the substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps one of its elements has a heavy isotope. Let's think about elements that have significant heavy isotopes. Chlorine has 35Cl and 37Cl. Bromine has 79Br and 81Br. Carbon has 12C, 13C, 14C. So perhaps X is something like NaCl, which is sodium chloride. Sodium has a heavier isotope (25Na?), but wait, sodium's common isotopes are 23Na (about 100% abundance). Chlorine has 35Cl and 37Cl.

Wait, but then when NaCl reacts with something, what happens? Maybe with water under certain conditions? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, like sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Sodium has a heavier isotope (like 25Na, though it's less common). So X could be Na2CO3. Then when it reacts with an acid Y, like HCl, the reaction produces CO2 gas, NaCl (which is soluble, so maybe G is not a precipitate). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the melting point of B. If B melts around 277 K (about 4°C), what is B? Maybe it's a substance that's solid at lower temperatures and melts just above 0°C. For instance, maybe it's a carbonate or a bicarbonate. Wait, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) has a melting point around 270 K (about -3°C), but that's close. Alternatively, potassium bicarbonate has a higher melting point. Wait, maybe B is sodium carbonate decahydrate, which has a melting point around 25°C, which is 298 K. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's another salt.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal. Let's think of metals with low melting points. Mercury melts at about 234 K (-39°C), which is lower than 277 K. Then, gallium melts around 300 K (27°C). So 277 K is just below that. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: when G is heated, it releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a bicarbonate and CO2. For example, perhaps G is sodium carbonate, which upon heating doesn't decompose, but if it's something else. Wait, no, most carbonates decompose upon heating, producing the metal oxide and CO2. For example, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 upon heating. But CaO has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe G is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) upon heating decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But the melting point of Na2CO3 is much higher than 277 K.

Wait, maybe B is a different substance. Let's think of a salt that has a melting point around 277 K. Alternatively, maybe B is a base. For example, sodium hydroxide has a melting point of about 318 K, which is higher than 277 K. Potassium hydroxide melts around 368 K. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think of something else. Maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point of 25°C (298 K), which is a bit higher than 277 K. Alternatively, maybe it's another hydrate.

Wait, perhaps B is ammonium chloride. The melting point of NH4Cl is around 337 K (64°C), which is higher than 277 K. Hmm. Not matching.

Wait, another angle: if B's melting point is around 277 K, which is about 4°C, perhaps B is a solid at room temperature and melts just above 0°C. One possibility is sodium acetate tetrahydrate, which has a melting point around 25°C. Wait, no, that's higher. Or maybe a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a type of salt that's used in ice melting, like calcium chloride. Wait, no, calcium chloride has a high melting point.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus more on the possible identities of X. Since X is a reagent in organic chemistry, maybe it's something like NaOH, which is used in many reactions, like saponification.

Wait, let's consider X as NaOH. Then, when it reacts with Y, perhaps Y is a carbonate, like ammonium carbonate or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So if X is NaOH, and the keto acid is RCOOH, then the product is RCOO^- Na^+. The formula would be NaOOCR. Each molecule would have two oxygen atoms in the carboxylate group (the O in COO^-). So that fits the condition.

So, if X is NaOH, then when it reacts with a keto acid, the product is a carboxylate with two oxygen atoms. That makes sense.

Now, let's think about the other part. X reacts with Y, a liquid, to produce gas W, which has equal protons and neutrons. NaOH reacting with what? Maybe Y is an ammonium salt. For example, if Y is ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3), then the reaction with NaOH would produce CO2 gas. Let me write the equation:

2 NaOH + (NH4)2CO3 → Na2CO3 + 2 NH3 + H2O.

In this case, the gas W would be NH3. Let's check: the molecule NH3 has 14 protons (N:7, H:3×1) and 10 neutrons (N:7-7=0? Wait, N has atomic number 7, so 7 protons. Each H has 0 neutrons (assuming light isotope). So NH3 has 7 protons and 0 + 0 (since H has no neutrons) plus the N's 7 neutrons (if it's ^14N? Wait, nitrogen usually has isotopes like ^14N (most common), ^13N, etc. So for W to have equal protons and neutrons, perhaps NH3 is not the right choice because the protons are 7+3=10, and the neutrons would be 7 (from N) + 3×0=7. So protons=10, neutrons=7; not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, so maybe that's not the right reaction. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Another possibility: if Y is a solution of a metal bicarbonate. For example, if Y is potassium bicarbonate, then NaOH reacting with it might produce something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. Let's think of other gases. Maybe O2: each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's ^16O). So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that fits. So W could be O2. But how would that be produced? Maybe through electrolysis or decomposition of a compound. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is producing O2.

Wait, perhaps Y is hydrogen peroxide. When NaOH reacts with H2O2, no, I don't think that produces O2. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again. The problem is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Wait, let's think of possible elements in X. If X is NaOH, the elements are Na (sodium) and O and H. Sodium's atomic mass is about 23, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1. So the cumulative atomic masses would be 23 (Na), 16 (O), and 1 (H). The heaviest is Na (23), lightest is H (1). So sum is 23 +1=24, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let's think of another reagent. Maybe X is potassium hydroxide, KOH. Then the elements are K (39), O (16), H (1). The cumulative atomic masses would be 39 (K), 16 (O), 1 (H). The lightest is H (1), heaviest K (39). Sum is 1+39=40, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is something like sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The elements are Na, C, O. Na has atomic mass 23, C is 12, O is 16. The heaviest element is Na (23), lightest is C (12), so sum is 23 + 12 = 35. That's option A) 35. Hmm, possible.

But wait, I need to check if this fits the other parts of the question.

If X is Na2CO3, then when it reacts with Y (liquid), perhaps Y is an acid. Let's say Y is HCl. The reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H2O + CO2↑.

So the gas W is CO2. Does CO2's molecule have equal protons and neutrons? Let's see: CO2 has one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and two O (8 protons each, 8 neutrons each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. So yes, equal. So that fits.

The precipitate G would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble in water, so that can't be. Hmm, so maybe Y isn't HCl. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another solution that would produce an insoluble product.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. For example, if Y is Cu(NO3)2, then reaction with Na2CO3 would produce CuCO3, which is insoluble. Wait, but I'm not sure about the solubility. Alternatively, maybe Y is another carbonate, but that would produce the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of AgNO3. Then the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + 2 AgNO3 → 2 NaNO3 + Ag2CO3.

Wait, but Ag2CO3 is not very soluble and might precipitate as G. Then, when G (Ag2CO3) is heated, it decomposes into Ag2O and CO2. But what's the melting point of Ag2O? Silver oxide has a melting point of around 1263 K, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track again. Let me think of another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. If X is Na2CO3, then the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + 2 RCOOH → 2 RCOO^- Na^+ + CO2↑ + H2O.

Wait, but the product here is sodium carboxylate and CO2 and water. So the sodium carboxylate would have two oxygen atoms per formula unit (from RCOO^-). So that fits the condition. So when X is Na2CO3, the product with a carboxylic acid has two O atoms.

Putting it all together: X is Na2CO3. When it reacts with an acid Y, it produces CO2 gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with melting point ~277 K.

Wait, but when Na2CO3 reacts with an acid, the precipitate would be the salt of the acid. For example, if Y is HCl, the product is NaCl, which is soluble, so no precipitate. So maybe Y is another acid, like H2SO4. Then the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps Y is not an acid. Maybe Y is a solution containing a metal ion that forms an insoluble carbonate. For example, if Y is a solution of CaCl2, then X (Na2CO3) would react to form CaCO3 precipitate and NaCl. So the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + CaCl2 → CaCO3 ↓ + 2 NaCl.

In this case, the precipitate G is CaCO3. Then, when heated, CaCO3 decomposes into CaO and CO2. The melting point of CaO is about 2570 K, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe Y is a solution of Pb(NO3)2. Then, Na2CO3 would react to form PbCO3 precipitate. PbCO3 decomposes upon heating to PbO and CO2. The melting point of PbO is around 890 K, which is higher than 277 K. So not matching.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a solution of Al(NO3)3. Then, Na2CO3 would react to form Al2(CO3)3, but I'm not sure if that's soluble. Alternatively, perhaps the product is AlCO3, which would precipitate. Then, upon heating, it would decompose to Al2O3 and CO2. The melting point of Al2O3 is about 2050 K, which is way higher. Not matching.

Another angle: perhaps Y is a solution of a group II carbonate. For example, if Y is CaCO3, but that's a solid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a carbonate solution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different kind of solution.

Wait, another thought: if the precipitate G is something that, when heated, gives a substance with a low melting point. Maybe G is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 is less soluble than Na2CO3. So if Y is a solution that causes the formation of NaHCO3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal bicarbonate. Wait, but I might be overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps X is not sodium carbonate. Let me think of another possibility. What if X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)? Then, when reacting with an acid Y, it would produce CO2 gas, water, and the salt of the acid.

For example, reaction with HCl:

2 NaHCO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2 CO2↑ + 2 H2O.

Wait, but again, the precipitate part is unclear.

Alternatively, when X is NaHCO3, reacting with Y (maybe a metal nitrate solution) could produce a precipitate. For example, adding AgNO3 to NaHCO3 solution might produce Ag2CO3, which precipitates. Wait, but Ag2CO3 is not very stable; it might decompose.

Wait, but let me think about the heating part. If G is, say, Ag2CO3, upon heating it might decompose to Ag2O and CO2. But the melting point of Ag2O is high.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2, but CO2 is a gas. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it doesn't decompose but perhaps loses some water, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G is a different compound altogether. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the gas W is H2. Because H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's deuterium), but that's not likely. Or if it's H2 with normal H, then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe W is C2H2, but that's acetylene. Each molecule has 2 C (each with 6 p, 6 n) and 2 H (each 1p, 0n). So total p= (2*6)+(2*1) =14; n= (2*6)+(2*0)=12. Not equal.

Alternatively, maybe W is C3H8 (propane), but that's not equal either.

Wait, another possibility: W is O=C=O, which is CO2. As I thought earlier, CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits. So W is CO2.

So, going back to X. If X is Na2CO3, then when it reacts with an acid Y, it produces CO2. But the precipitate G would be a salt, which must be insoluble. So perhaps Y is a solution of a metal nitrate that reacts with Na2CO3 to form an insoluble carbonate.

For example, if Y is a solution of Cu(NO3)2, then:

Na2CO3 + Cu(NO3)2 → CuCO3 ↓ + 2 NaNO3.

CuCO3 is slightly soluble but can precipitate. Then, when heated, CuCO3 decomposes into CuO and CO2. The melting point of CuO is about 1400 K, which is higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a solution of a group IIA metal nitrate, like Mg(NO3)2. Then, MgCO3 is not very soluble and would precipitate. Heating MgCO3 would decompose into MgO and CO2. MgO's melting point is around 2800 K, which is way higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the precipitate G is not a carbonate but something else. Let me think differently. Maybe Y is a solution of a different salt. For example, if Y is a solution of Pb(NO3)2, then reacting with Na2CO3 would produce PbCO3 precipitate. PbCO3 upon heating decomposes into PbO and CO2. The melting point of PbO is around 890 K, which is higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B isn't a metal oxide but another compound. Let's think of a compound that has a low melting point around 277 K. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point around 270 K (-3°C), which is close to 277 K. So if B is sodium acetate trihydrate, that could fit. But how would that form?

If G is a substance that upon heating gives sodium acetate trihydrate, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps G is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction of X with Y is not an acid-base reaction. Maybe it's a double displacement reaction. For example, X could be a carbonate, and Y could be a solution of a sulfide. Then, the reaction would produce a sulfide precipitate and CO2 gas.

For example, Na2CO3 + H2S → Na2S + CO2↑ + H2O. But Na2S is soluble, so G wouldn't precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a chloride, and X is a carbonate. Wait, but that might not produce a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a hydroxide. For example, if Y is Ba(OH)2, then reacting with X (Na2CO3) would produce BaCO3 precipitate and NaOH. The reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + Ba(OH)2 → BaCO3 ↓ + 2 NaOH.

BaCO3 is insoluble. Upon heating, BaCO3 might decompose into BaO and CO2. The melting point of BaO is about 2200 K, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a bicarbonate, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the product when X reacts with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. If X is Na2CO3, then reacting with a carboxylic acid would typically produce the sodium salt of the acid (sodium carboxylate), which has two oxygen atoms per molecule. So that fits.

Now, going back to the main reaction: X (Na2CO3) reacts with Y (maybe a nitrate solution) to produce CO2 gas, a precipitate G (like BaCO3), and when G is heated, it gives B. But BaCO3's decomposition doesn't fit the melting point.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a group IV metal nitrate, like Pb(NO3)2. Then, the reaction would produce PbCO3 precipitate. Heating PbCO3 would give PbO and CO2. PbO has a high melting point, so that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I need to think of a different X. Let me think about the options again. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are one of the given options. So if the sum is 35, that could be from Na (23) and Cl (35) for example. Wait, but that would imply X contains Na and Cl. So perhaps X is NaCl (sodium chloride). But then, when X reacts with Y, what happens?

Wait, if X is NaCl, and Y is a solution of AgNO3, then the reaction would be:

NaCl + AgNO3 → AgCl ↓ + NaNO3.

So the precipitate G is AgCl. Then, when G is heated, AgCl decomposes into Ag and Cl2. The melting point of Ag is about 962 K, which is higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of Pb(NO3)2. Then, NaCl would react to form PbCl2, which is soluble. Not helpful.

Another thought: if X is NaCl and Y is a solution of a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, no reaction would occur since both are sodium salts. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of another reagent used in organic chemistry. Maybe X is a hydroxide, like NaOH.

If X is NaOH, then when it reacts with Y (maybe an ammonium carbonate), it produces CO2. Let's say Y is (NH4)2CO3. The reaction would be:

2 NaOH + (NH4)2CO3 → Na2CO3 + 2 NH3 + H2O.

So the gas W is NH3. Does NH3 have equal protons and neutrons? Let's see: each molecule has 1 nitrogen (7 protons, 7 neutrons if ^14N) and 3 hydrogens (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons). So total protons: 7 +3=10. Neutrons:7 +0=7. Not equal. So that's 10 vs 7, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe Y is a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfite, and the reaction produces SO2 gas. Let me check: SO2 has 32 protons (S:16, O:16) and 32 neutrons (S has 16-16=0? Wait, no. Sulfur has atomic number 16, so 16 protons. Common isotope is ^32S, which has 16 neutrons. So SO2 would have 16+16=32 protons and 16 (S) + 2*8 (each O) = 16+16=32 neutrons. So yes, equal. So W could be SO2. Then, the reaction would be between X (maybe a hydroxide) and Y (a sulfite) to produce SO2.

But I'm not sure about the rest.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, reacting with X (H2O?), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps X is Na2S. Reacting with Y (maybe an acid) would produce H2S gas. H2S has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if S is ^32S, which has 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So H2S has 2 protons and 16+16=32 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the initial part again. The question says substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So one of its elements has a heavy isotope. For example, if X is NaCl, Cl has 35Cl and 37Cl. So when considering the isotopes, the cumulative atomic masses would be:

Lightest and heaviest elements in X: Na (23) and Cl (35 or 37). So the sum would be 23 + 35=58, or 23+37=60. But the options don't have those.

Wait, the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So if X is NaCl, the lightest element is Na (23) and heaviest is Cl (35 or 37). So sum is 23 + 35=58 or 23+37=60. But the options don't include that. So perhaps X is not NaCl.

Wait, another possibility: X is NaNO3 (sodium nitrate). The elements are Na (23), N (14), O (16). Lightest is N (14), heaviest is Na (23). Sum 14+23=37, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is KOH. Elements are K (39), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest K (39). Sum 1+39=40, not an option.

Wait, another thought: the cumulative atomic masses are summed for all elements in X. Wait, no, the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So it's looking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me think of another X. Suppose X is potassium permanganate (KMnO4). Then, elements are K (39), Mn (55), O (16). Lightest is O (16), heaviest Mn (55). Sum 16+55=71, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide like Ca(OH)2. Elements are Ca (40), O (16), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest Ca (40). Sum is 41, not an option.

Wait, another angle: the options are 25, 29,31,35. Let's see what combinations of elements could sum to these.

Option D is 29. Let's see: 1 (H) +28 (Si) =29. But does X contain H and Si? Unlikely. Or 12 (C) +17 (Cl)=29. So if X contains C and Cl, perhaps X is CCl4? But that's a compound, but I'm not sure if it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Option C is 31: 15 (P) +16 (O) =31. Or 14 (N) +17 (Cl)=31. Or 12 (C) +19 (K)=31. Not sure.

Option B is 25: 12 (C) +13 (Al)=25. Or 9 (F) +16 (O)=25.

Option A is 35: 14 (N) +21 (Sc)=35. Or 12 (C) +23 (Na)=35. Or 15 (P) +20 (Ca)=35.

Wait, if X contains C and Na, then sum is 12+23=35. Which is option A. So perhaps X is Na2CO3. Then, the lightest element is C (12), and the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 12+23=35, which is option A. That fits.

So putting it all together:

- X is Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate).
- Reacts with Y (an acid) to produce CO2 gas (W), which fits as CO2 has equal protons and neutrons.
- The precipitate G could be a metal carbonate, which upon heating decomposes to a metal oxide and CO2. But the metal oxide's melting point is supposed to be around 277 K. Hmm, but earlier that didn't fit. Maybe I'm missing something here.
- The product when X reacts with a keto acid is sodium carboxylate, which has two oxygen atoms per formula unit.

But the main point is that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (Na and C) sum to 35, which is option A.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W, forms a precipitate G, and upon heating, G releases B with a melting point close to 277 K. Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The goal is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. CO₂ fits this criterion, as it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. This suggests that X reacts with Y to produce CO₂.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of approximately 277 K (~4°C). This melting point is consistent with sodium acetate trihydrate (NaC₂H₃O₂·3H₂O), which has a melting point near 270 K. However, the exact identity of B is not critical to solving the problem.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This is consistent with X being a carbonate (e.g., Na₂CO₃), which reacts with a carboxylic acid to form a sodium carboxylate salt, such as NaOOCR. The carboxylate group (COO⁻) contains two oxygen atoms.

4. **Substance X**: Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) is a plausible candidate for X. It reacts with acids to produce CO₂ gas, forms precipitates with metal nitrates (e.g., BaCO₃), and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: Sodium (Na) has an atomic mass of approximately 23, and carbon (C) has an atomic mass of 12. These are the lightest and heaviest elements in Na₂CO₃, respectively. Their cumulative atomic masses sum to $23 + 12 = 35$.

### Conclusion:
The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (sodium and carbon) sum to 35. This corresponds to **Option A**.
