Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (π) is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. But how does that tie into the number of stars we observe?

If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So the number of stars in a given volume depends on how much of that volume we're looking at. But since parallax is a measure of distance, I think we need to relate the volume to parallax.

Let me recall the formula for distance in terms of parallax. Oh yeah, distance d is approximately 1/π (in parsecs when π is in arcseconds). So as π increases, the distance decreases. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait: wait, when you have a larger parallax, the star is closer. Because parallax is the apparent shift in position as we orbit the sun. So a closer star has a larger parallax. Right.

So if I'm looking at a range of parallaxes, say from π to π + dπ, I want to find how many stars are in that range. Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a volume element should be proportional to the volume.

Wait, but how do I calculate the volume in terms of parallax? Let's think about it. Let's say I have two distances, d and d + dd. The volume between these two distances would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by the thickness dd. Because the volume between two spheres is 4π d² dd.

But wait, since we're dealing with parallax, which is π = 1/d (approximately), I can express d as 1/π. So d = 1/π, and the volume element would be 4π d² dd. Let me substitute d in terms of π.

So d = 1/π, so d squared is (1/π)^2. Then the volume element becomes 4π * (1/π²) * (dπ). Hmm, wait, wait. Because when π changes by dπ, the corresponding change in d is dd. Let me compute dd in terms of dπ.

Since π = 1/d, then dπ = -d/d²? Wait, no. Let me think. dπ is the change in π. So, let's take the derivative of π with respect to d.

π = 1/d → dπ = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² dπ. But since we're considering the change in d, which is positive when π decreases, but for the volume, I'm just concerned with the magnitude. So the volume element becomes 4π (d)^2 * dd. Substituting d and dd in terms of π.

Wait, maybe there's a better approach. Let's express the volume in terms of π. The volume between two spheres is 4π d² dd. So if I can express d in terms of π and dd in terms of dπ, I can substitute.

d = 1/π → d² = 1/π². Now, for dd, from π to π + dπ, the change in d is negative because as π increases, d decreases. So, π + dπ = 1/(d + dd) → approximating for small dπ, maybe? Or using the derivative.

Wait, let's take π = 1/d → d = 1/π. So, if π increases by dπ, then the new d is 1/(π + dπ). The change in d is d + dd = 1/(π + dπ). So, the change in d is approximately - (dπ)/(π²) using a Taylor expansion, since for small dπ, 1/(π + dπ) ≈ 1/π - dπ/(π²). So, dd ≈ -dπ/(π²). Because dπ is positive when π increases, but dd is negative because d decreases as π increases.

But wait, the volume element is the difference in d multiplied by the surface area. So, the volume between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/π, so d² = 1/π². And dd ≈ -dπ/(π²). Wait, but the volume should be positive, so maybe I should take the absolute value.

So, the volume element dV = 4π (1/π²) ( -dπ/(π²) ) ) → Wait, but that would give a negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I should take the magnitude. So, dV = 4π (1/π²) (dπ/π²) ) → 4π * (1/π²) * (dπ/π²) ) → 4π * (dπ) / π^4 → (4 dπ)/(π^3). Hmm, but that seems a bit off.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's express dV in terms of π. So dV = 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/π, then dd = - (d²)/π² dπ, because from π to π + dπ, the change in d is negative.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can express dd in terms of dπ. Let me re-express dV as a function of π.

Another approach: If the number of stars is uniform, the number per unit volume is constant. Let's say n is the number density (stars per cubic parsec). Then the number of stars in a volume element dV is n * dV.

dV is the volume between d and d + dd. So, dV = 4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of π, since d = 1/π, so dd = - (1/π²) dπ.

Wait, wait: π = 1/d → d = 1/π → dd = - (1/π²) dπ. So substituting into dV:

dV = 4π (d^2) * (dd) ) = 4π ( (1/π)^2 ) * ( -1/π² dπ ) ). Wait, but that would give a negative volume, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I should take the magnitude.

So, dV = 4π (1/π²) * (dπ/π²) ) → 4π * (dπ) / π^4 → 4 dπ / π^3.

So, the number of stars in this volume element is n * dV = n * (4 dπ / π^3) ) → n * 4 dπ / π^3.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So the number per unit dπ is (n * 4 dπ ) / π^3. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars in a range of parallax dπ is the number density n multiplied by the volume dV. So N = n * dV.

We have dV = 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/π, and dd = - (1/π²) dπ, the volume is 4π (1/π^2) (dπ / π²) ), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute dV in terms of π.

Let me re-derive the volume between π and π + dπ.

At a given distance d, the volume element between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd.

But d is 1/π, so we can write d = 1/π.

So, substituting d into the volume:

dV = 4π ( (1/π)^2 ) * dd.

But we need to express dd in terms of dπ.

Since π = 1/d, then dπ = - (1/d^2) dd → dd = - d^2 dπ.

Substituting d = 1/π, dd = - (1/π^2) dπ.

So, substituting into dV:

dV = 4π (1/π^2) * ( -1/π^2 dπ ) ) → 4π * (1/π^2) * (1/π^2) dπ, ignoring the sign.

So, dV = 4π * (1/π^4) dπ → (4 / π^3) dπ.

So, the number of stars in this volume is n * (4 / π^3) dπ.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per dπ). So per unit dπ, the number is (n * 4 / π^3) ) * dπ / dπ → n * 4 / π^3.

So N = (4 n / π^3 ) * dπ.

Wait, but the number per unit dπ is (n * 4 / π^3 ). So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dπ) is proportional to 1/π^3. So the number decreases as 1/π^3.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If the number density is n, then the number in a volume dV is n * dV.

We found dV = (4 / π^3) dπ.

So the number of stars in a dπ interval is n * 4 dπ / π^3.

So, the number per unit dπ would be n * 4 / π^3.

So, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dπ) is proportional to 1/π^3. So the correct option would be D) ~ 1/plx^3.

But looking back at the options, option D is ~ 1/plx^3.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the volume element. Let me think again. Because the volume between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd, correct. So substituting d = 1/π and dd = - (1/π^2) dπ, the volume is 4π (1/π^2) (1/π^2 dπ ), but wait, that's 4π * (1/π^4) dπ. Which is 4/(π^3) dπ. So yes, the number per dπ is (n * 4 ) / π^3.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dπ) is proportional to 1/π^3. So the answer should be D.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax (π) is inversely proportional to distance (d), such that \( \pi = \frac{1}{d} \). If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself. 

The volume between two spheres of radius \( d \) and \( d + dd \) is given by:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dd
\]

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\pi} \), we substitute \( d \) and \( dd \) in terms of \( \pi \). From \( \pi = \frac{1}{d} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\pi^2} d\pi \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\pi} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\pi^2} d\pi \) into the volume equation:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\pi^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\pi^2} d\pi\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
dV = 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\pi^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\pi^2} \cdot d\pi = \frac{4}{\pi^3} d\pi
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the number density of stars \( n \) multiplied by the volume \( dV \):

\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \frac{4}{\pi^3} d\pi
\]

To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\pi \)), we divide \( N \) by \( d\pi \):

\[
\text{Number per unit } d\pi = \frac{N}{d\pi} = \frac{n \cdot \frac{4}{\pi^3} d\pi}{d\pi} = \frac{4n}{\pi^3}
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\pi^3} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
