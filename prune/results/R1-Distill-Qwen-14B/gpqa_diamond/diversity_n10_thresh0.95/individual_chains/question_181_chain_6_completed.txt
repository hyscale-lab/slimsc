Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are as usual. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) is which option?

Hmm, first, I recall that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that convert hydrogen into helium, releasing energy. The pp-III branch is one part of this process. I think the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce high-energy neutrinos.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in various parts of the Sun's reactions. The main neutrino production comes from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces a lot of high-energy neutrinos because it involves the decay of a specific isotope, maybe Carbon-13 or something similar. Or wait, isn't it that the main neutrinos come from the decay of Beryllium-7 into Lithium-7, which emits a neutrino? Or maybe that's the pep branch?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The dominant neutrino production in the Sun is from the proton-proton chain's main branch, the pp-I process. The pp-II and pp-III are less significant. The pp-I process involves two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3, and then two helium-3s fusing into helium-4. But the key point is that in some of these steps, like the last one, a neutrino is emitted when a positron is annihilated or something like that.

Wait, no. Another part of the pp chain, perhaps the so-called "luminosity" neutrinos are from the electron capture in the decay of beryllium-7. Oh, right. So Be-7 captures a proton to become Li-7, which then decays via electron capture into He-4, emitting a neutrino. Those are the main solar neutrinos we detect, like in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.

But the question is about the pp-III branch stopping. So what's the pp-III branch? I think it's a part of the pp chain that involves higher temperatures, maybe involving Carbon-12. So the pp-III would produce higher-energy neutrinos? Or perhaps I'm mixing this up with the CNO cycle.

Wait, the CNO cycle is a different fusion process, more dominant in heavier stars. The Sun is mostly pp chain. The CNO cycle does produce some neutrinos as part of its reactions, but I think the main neutrinos from the Sun are from the pp chain's Be-7 decay.

But pp-III might involve reactions that produce higher-energy neutrinos. For example, in the pp-III branch, perhaps a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus (which is a triton?), leading to a Carbon-12 nucleus. Then, that can undergo other reactions. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

Wait, another approach: neutrinos emitted from the Sun have a spectrum. The flux of neutrinos at different energies depends on the production processes. The main neutrinos from the pp chain have a certain energy distribution. If the pp-III branch is stopped, which neutrino energies are affected?

So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of neutrinos at higher energies (like in the hundreds of keV) would drop. The flux depends on the production rate and the survival probability, but the question says that neutrino flavor changes don't matter here, so we can ignore oscillations. So, the flux is just about the production.

So, the pp-III branch is a source of high-energy neutrinos. If it's stopped, the flux in higher bands would drop, but the lower bands might be less affected, assuming the lower bands come from other branches.

Wait, no, maybe the neutrino spectrum is such that the higher energy neutrinos come from the pp-III branch. So if that's stopped, the higher energy flux (like band 2, 800-900 keV) would drop, while the lower band (700-800) might not be affected as much.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the solar neutrino spectrum. The main neutrinos from the Sun peak around 400 keV, I believe, but there are also higher-energy neutrinos. The higher-energy ones might be from the pp-III branch.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos are at higher energies. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in higher bands would drop, while the lower bands are from other processes that are still active.

So, let's say that the neutrino flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would be similar to before, but band 2 (800-900) would be reduced. Therefore, the ratio Flux1/Flux2 would be higher than 1, like 10 or something.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another angle: the flux of neutrinos is proportional to the production rate multiplied by the survival probability. Assuming that the survival probability (which depends on the neutrino energy and the time it takes to travel from the Sun to Earth) is roughly the same for these energy bands. So the flux ratio would mainly depend on the production rates.

If the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in the higher energy bands, then stopping it would significantly reduce the flux in band 2. If band 1 is from other processes that are unaffected, then the flux in band 1 stays about the same, and band 2's flux drops. So their ratio would be higher.

What's the typical flux contribution from the pp-III branch compared to others? I remember that the main neutrino flux from the Sun is from the Be-7 decay in the pp chain, which has a peak around 400 keV. Then, there are other processes with higher energies.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. For example, in the standard solar model, the neutrino flux above about 200 keV is from the proton-proton chain. But the exact distribution, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch contributes neutrinos around 1 MeV or higher. Wait, I think that the main neutrinos from the Sun (the so-called "luminosity neutrinos") are around 400 keV. But there are also some neutrinos from the CNO cycle, which have higher energies, but the Sun's CNO contribution is minor compared to the pp chain.

Wait, no. The CNO cycle is more efficient in heavier stars, but the Sun's main fusion is the pp chain. The CNO cycle in the Sun contributes a small fraction of the total energy production. So maybe the CNO neutrinos are less significant in terms of flux.

But the question is about the pp-III branch. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, which neutrinos are affected? Let me think about the neutrino emission in the pp chain.

In the pp chain, after the initial steps leading to helium-3, there's a step where two helium-3s fuse into helium-4, emitting two protons. But that's the main process. Another possible reaction is a helium-3 capturing a proton to form a carbon-12 nucleus. Then, this carbon-12 can undergo other reactions. The pp-III branch might involve the decay of carbon-13 into nitrogen-13, emitting a neutrino.

Wait, I think the main neutrino sources are the decay of Be-7 (which is part of the main pp chain) and the decay of C-13 (which is part of the pp-III branch). So stopping the pp-III would stop the C-13 decay and thus the neutrinos from that process.

Carbon-13 is part of the CNO cycle? Or is it part of the pp chain? Wait, the CNO cycle involves reactions with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. But in the pp chain, some steps involve carbon. Hmm, maybe the pp-III branch is part of the pp chain, not the CNO cycle.

So, the C-13 decay would produce a neutrino. The lifetime of C-13 is longer than Be-7, so the neutrinos from C-13 would have a lower flux because they take longer to decay. Wait, but the neutrino flux is a combination of production rate and lifetime. So if the pp-III is stopped, the production of C-13 would stop, so the decay would stop, meaning fewer high-energy neutrinos.

So, the neutrinos from C-13 decay have higher energies than those from Be-7. Because Be-7's neutrinos are around 400 keV, while the C-13 decay produces higher-energy neutrinos, maybe around 1 MeV or so? Or perhaps I'm getting the energy levels wrong.

Wait, here's a thought: the neutrinos from Be-7 decay are around 0.42 MeV (420 keV). The neutrinos from C-13 decay would be higher, perhaps around 1.4 MeV or something like that. But I'm not certain about the exact energies.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, the C-13 decay (and thus the high-energy neutrinos) stops. So the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would be similar to before, because that's in the range just above the Be-7 neutrinos but lower than the C-13 neutrinos. Wait, no. If the C-13 neutrinos are higher than 800 keV, then the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would be affected.

But wait, if the C-13 decay produces neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range, then stopping the pp-III branch would mean the C-13 neutrinos stop. So the flux in band 2 would drop to almost zero, while band 1, which is 700-800 keV, is from Be-7 and unaffected.

So, the ratio would be Flux1/Flux2 = (normal Be-7 flux in band 1) / (very low flux in band 2). So that ratio would be very high, like 10 or more. But wait, if the C-13 neutrinos are in band 2, then the flux in band 2 would be much lower than in band 1, making the ratio high.

Wait, but what if the C-13 neutrinos are in band 1? That would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the Be-7 neutrinos peak around 400 keV, and other neutrinos (like from C-13) have higher energies.

Let me think about the solar neutrino spectrum. The main neutrino peak is around 400 keV (from Be-7 decay). There's also a higher-energy component, perhaps from the decay of C-13, which might be around 1.4 MeV. Wait, that's higher than 1 MeV, which is way beyond the bands in the question. So the bands in the question are 700-800 and 800-900 keV, which are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range.

Hmm, so if the C-13 decay produces neutrinos around 1.4 MeV, which is higher than the bands given, then the bands in the question (700-800 and 800-900 keV) would be below that. So stopping the pp-III branch would not affect these bands, but that can't be right because the question says that the flux ratio changes.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the neutrino energies. Let me think again.

Be-7 decay emits a neutrino with an energy of about 0.42 MeV (420 keV). The C-13 decay emits a neutrino with an energy of about 1.42 MeV. So the bands in the question (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, which is between the two. So, the neutrinos from C-13 decay are not in this range, but perhaps there's another process producing neutrinos in that range.

Wait, maybe the neutrinos from the pep branch. The pep (proton-electron-proton) branch is another part of the pp chain. The pep reaction emits a neutrino when a proton captures a positron. The energy of the pep neutrino is around 1.4 MeV as well, I think. So that's higher than the bands in question.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me look for a different approach.

The question is about the pp-III branch stopping. So if that stops, which neutrinos are affected?

If the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos, then those neutrinos would no longer be produced. The flux in the higher band (band 2) would drop, while band 1 (lower energy) remains the same.

But wait, the neutrinos from Be-7 are around 0.42 MeV, and the higher-energy neutrinos from other processes are higher than that. So the bands in question are 700-800 (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 (0.8-0.9 MeV). So if the pp-III branch is the source of the higher-energy neutrinos in these bands, then stopping it would decrease the flux in band 2.

But I'm not sure whether the pp-III neutrinos are actually in this range. If the neutrinos from pp-III are at 0.7 MeV or higher, then stopping the branch would reduce the flux in band2.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from pp-III are in band 1. So if the pp-III is stopped, the lower band's flux drops more than the higher band's, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, another thought: the neutrino flux from the Sun is a combination of all active processes. If the pp-III branch is stopped, the only neutrinos affected are those produced in that branch. So the higher-energy bands would have less contribution.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact energy ranges. Let me try to think about the options.

The options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

If the pp-III neutrinos are in band 2, then after the branch stops, band2's flux would drop a lot, making the ratio (flux1/flux2) increase. So if band1 was unaffected, and band2 flux drops, the ratio would be high, like 10.

Alternatively, if the pp-III neutrinos are in band1, then stopping it would cause band1 to drop, making the ratio lower. But that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos are in both bands. Hmm, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps the flux in each band is dominated by a specific reaction. The main neutrinos (Be-7) are around 400 keV. Are there other neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range? Or is that a region where flux is low?

If the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band1. But if the pp-III is the only source of neutrinos in band2 (say, 800-900 keV), then the ratio would be (flux1)/(flux2) = (normal band1)/(lower band2).

Wait, but perhaps without the pp-III branch, the flux in both bands is reduced. But the question is about the ratio between them.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III contributes neutrinos that are in band2, so flux2 would drop more than flux1. So the ratio would go up.

But without knowing the exact energy ranges of the neutrinos from pp-III, it's challenging.

Another angle: in the standard solar model, the neutrino flux from the pp chain has a peak around 400 keV, and then it drops off at higher energies. But some processes, like the pp-III branch, contribute to higher energies, so their flux is lower than the main peak but not zero.

So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the higher energy neutrinos would no longer be produced. So the flux in band2 (800-900 keV) would drop, while band1 (700-800) might have a lower flux but perhaps not as much of a drop.

Wait, but perhaps the flux in band1 is already low without pp-III, so stopping it would make band2's flux even lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the main source of neutrinos in band1 is the Be-7 decay, and the source for band2 is the pp-III.

Wait, if Be-7 is around 400 keV, but maybe there are other processes that emit neutrinos at higher energies, but the pp-III is a major contributor to the higher energies.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible answer based on the options.

If the pp-III neutrinos are in band2, then stopping it would drop the flux in band2, making the ratio (flux1/flux2) higher. So the options with higher ratios are A (10) or C (1). But if the ratio was 10, that would mean band1 is 10 times band2, which requires band2 to be a tenth of band1.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the neutrino flux from the pp-III branch is a small fraction of the total. So stopping it would reduce the higher energy flux, making band2's flux lower.

So, if previously, band1's flux was, say, 100 neutrinos per cm² per second, and band2 was 10, the ratio is 10.

But if the pp-III branch contributes, say, 50% of band2's flux, then stopping it would drop band2's flux to 5, making the ratio 100/5 =20, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are a minor component, so the flux ratio doesn't change much. But that would lead to a ratio near 1, option C.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch is stopped. So the neutrinos from that branch are gone. If the pp-III branch contributed significantly to the higher energy band, then the flux in band2 would drop, increasing the ratio.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute much to the flux in either band, so the ratio remains about 1.

But I'm not confident. Let me think about the neutrino flux from the pp chain. The main neutrinos are from Be-7 decay, around 400 keV. Then, there are other neutrinos from the pp-III branch (C-13 decay), which are around 1.42 MeV. Wait, that's way above the bands in the question.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos are at 1.42 MeV, then the bands in question (700-800 and 800-900 keV) are lower than that. So, the flux in those bands is from other sources, maybe the decay of other isotopes.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of Beryllium-9? Or maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. The pp-III branch contributes to the higher-energy neutrinos, which are in band2. So, if the pp-III stops, band2's flux drops a lot, and band1's flux remains roughly the same.

Assuming that the neutrino flux in band1 is mostly from the Be-7 decay and other parts of the pp chain that are unaffected, and band2 is mostly from the pp-III, then the ratio would be flux1/flux2. If band1's flux was, say, 10 times band2's before, then after stopping pp-III, band2's flux would be much lower. But I'm not sure about the exact ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the main source of neutrinos in band1 is the pp-III, so stopping it would reduce band1's flux, but that doesn't fit with the options.

Another approach: what's the typical spectrum of solar neutrinos? The main peak is around 400 keV, and the flux drops off as energy increases. So, the flux in 700-800 keV is lower than in 400-600 keV. But the question is comparing two adjacent bands, both in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range.

If the pp-III neutrinos are in a higher energy range (like 1 MeV), then their stopping wouldn't affect these bands, and the ratio would be about 1. But the options don't have a 'no change' except for C) 1.

Alternatively, if the pp-III neutrinos are in band1, then stopping pp-III would cause a drop in band1. But I don't know.

Given that the question says that the pp-III branch stops, and considering that the neutrino flux from this branch is a minor component, perhaps the ratio doesn't change much, leading to a ratio near 1. So the answer would be C) 1.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a major source of neutrinos in band2, so the flux in band2 would drop, increasing the ratio. So the ratio would be 10 if band1 is 10 times band2 after the stop.

But I'm getting stuck because I'm unsure about the exact neutrino energies from the pp-III branch.

Wait, another thought: the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, which would be in band2. So, if the pp-III is stopped, band2's flux drops, and band1's flux remains. So the ratio would be higher than 1.

Looking at the options, A is 10, D is 0.1.

If the pp-III neutrinos contributed 90% of band2's flux, then stopping it would make band2's flux 10% of what it was. So if band1 was, say, 100 and band2 was 10 before, the ratio would be 10. After stopping, band2 is 1, so the ratio becomes 100/1=100, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are a small part of the total. So the flux in band2 is reduced, but not by a huge factor. For example, if pp-III contributed 1/10th of band2's flux, then stopping it would reduce band2 by 1/10, making the ratio 10/(0.9) ~ 11.1, which is close to option A (10).

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to band2, so the ratio would be much higher.

But without exact numbers, it's hard to tell. Maybe the Solar neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV range is dominated by the Be-7 neutrinos, while the 800-900 keV is from other processes. If the pp-III is stopped, the 800-900 keV flux drops, making the ratio higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the main neutrino flux from the Sun at around 700 keV is from the decay of another isotope. Or maybe it's from the same Be-7, but that's unlikely because Be-7's neutrinos are around 400 keV.

Wait, another thought: maybe the neutrinos from the decay of C-13 are in the 1.4 MeV range, which is higher than the bands in question. So, the bands in the question are below that, so they wouldn't be affected. So, the flux ratio would remain the same, leading to option C)1.

But then why would the question mention stopping the pp-III branch? Because it wouldn't affect the flux in these bands.

Hmm, maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the range of the bands given. For instance, maybe the C-13 decay produces neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range.

Wait, I think I need to think in terms of the neutrino energy. The decay of C-13 into N-13 emits a neutrino with a certain energy. The binding energy of the C-13 and N-13 would determine the neutrino energy. Let me think: the mass of C-13 is about 13.0034 amu, and N-13 is about 13.0057 amu. The Q-value of the decay would be the difference in mass times c^2. Let me calculate that.

The mass difference is 13.0057 - 13.0034 = 0.0023 amu. 1 amu is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 0.0023 * 931.5 ≈ 2.142 MeV. So the Q-value is about 2.142 MeV. But the neutrino energy would be less than that because of the kinetic energy distribution. But wait, in the decay C-13 → N-13 + e+ + ν_e, the Q is 2.142 MeV. The neutrino would carry away some of this energy, but the maximum energy is around 2.14 MeV, and the average is lower.

So the neutrino energy from C-13 decay is about 1-2 MeV. So, that's way above the bands in the question (700-800 and 800-900 keV, which are 0.7-0.9 MeV). So, the C-13 decay's neutrinos are in a higher energy range than the bands in the question.

So, if the pp-III branch (which produces C-13 decay neutrinos) is stopped, the flux in the bands in question wouldn't be affected much. So the ratio would remain approximately the same as before, leading to option C)1.

But wait, the flux from the Be-7 decay is around 400 keV, so the 700-800 keV band is higher than that. So, the neutrinos in this band must come from other processes. Could the pp-III branch contribute to this band? It doesn't seem so because the C-13 neutrinos are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps there are other processes that emit neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. For example, the pep branch, which is a part of the pp chain, emits neutrinos when a proton captures a positron. The pep neutrino energy is around 1.4 MeV (I think), which is higher than the bands in question. So again, the neutrinos in the bands in question aren't from the pep branch or C-13 decay.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of other isotopes, such as Boron-8? No, Boron-8 is from the CNO cycle and produces neutrinos around 15-20 MeV, which are even higher.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe the main point is that the pp-III branch stops, which produces higher-energy neutrinos, so the flux in band2 (higher energy) drops. If the pp-III neutrinos are mainly in band2, then the flux in band2 would drop, making the ratio (flux1/flux2) higher.

But since the C-13 neutrinos are at ~1.4 MeV, which is beyond the given bands, the flux in the bands in the question wouldn't be affected. So the ratio remains approximately 1.

Therefore, the answer would be C)1.

Wait, but the question asks about the approximate ratio. So if the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute to these bands, the ratio wouldn't change, so the answer is C)1.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III are in the 700-800 keV range. But I thought they were higher.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct approach is to recall that the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, which would be in the higher band. So if the pp-III stops, band2's flux drops, making the ratio higher. So the answer is A)10.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think of it another way: the main neutrino emission from the pp-III branch is for higher energies, so the neutrinos in band2 are from pp-III. If the pp-III stops, band2's flux drops to near zero, while band1's is unaffected. So the ratio is band1_flux / band2_flux ≈ (normal) / (very low) → large number. So option A)10.

But another possibility is that the neutrinos in the bands are from other processes. So the ratio remains near 1. But without knowing the exact neutrino energies, it's hard to say.

Given that the question is about the pp-III branch, which is a minor contributor, perhaps the ratio doesn't change much, leading to option C)1. But I'm not really confident.

Wait, another thought: The pp-III branch is not the main source of solar neutrinos. The main source is the Be-7 decay in the pp-I branch. So stopping the pp-III branch would only affect a minor fraction of the neutrinos. Therefore, the flux in band2 would drop, but not by a huge factor. Hence, the ratio would be close to 1, since the main source is still present.

But I don't know. Alternatively, if the pp-III contributes significantly to band2, the ratio could be higher.

Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is C)1, assuming that the neutrinos in the given bands are not significantly affected by the pp-III stoppage.


The question involves analyzing the effect of stopping the pp-III branch in the Sun's core on the neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain and is known to produce high-energy neutrinos, typically associated with the decay of Carbon-13 (C-13) into Nitrogen-13, which emits neutrinos with energies around 1.42 MeV. However, the energy bands in question (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) are below this range, suggesting that the neutrinos from the pp-III branch do not directly contribute to these bands.

The main neutrino flux from the Sun is dominated by the decay of Beryllium-7 (Be-7), which produces neutrinos with energies around 400 keV. These neutrinos are unrelated to the pp-III branch. The energy bands in question (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) likely receive contributions from other processes, such as the decay of isotopes or other minor branches of the proton-proton chain, but the pp-III branch does not significantly affect these bands.

Stopping the pp-III branch would primarily reduce the flux of high-energy neutrinos above 1 MeV, which are not relevant to the given bands. Since the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are not significantly affected by the pp-III branch, the flux ratio between these bands would remain approximately the same. Therefore, the ratio of flux(band 1) to flux(band 2) would be close to 1.

Given the options provided, the most reasonable conclusion is that the flux ratio remains unchanged, leading to the answer:

**Answer: C**
