Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it again.

So the question is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star has a radius equal to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, we see brightness variations which might look like an exoplanet transiting. The question is, what radius would a planet have to have to produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's specified that "if the star was not covered by spots!" So I think the question is asking, when comparing the light curve amplitude caused by a planet transiting the star to the amplitude caused by these spots, what planet radius would be needed.

So I need to find Rpl/Rstar, where Rpl is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. The options are A through D, each a number around 0.3 or 0.1 or so.

Okay, so the approach here is to calculate the change in brightness (the amplitude of the dip) caused by the spots, and then compare that to the amplitude caused by a planet transit. The planet's amplitude would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2 because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, the spots are causing a dip too. So I need to compute the dip caused by the spots, and then set the planet's dip equal to that, then solve for Rpl.

Wait, but the star isn't completely covered by spots. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Hmm, so let's think about the star's surface.

The star has a radius Rstar. One hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface, right? So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) * 2? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So if the star is a sphere, each hemisphere is half the surface area. So the area of a hemisphere is (4π R²)/2 = 2π R². The filling factor is 20%, so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, when the star rotates, only one hemisphere is facing us. So when we observe the star, only the spotted hemisphere's spot coverage affects the observed brightness. So as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the brightness variations.

But when the star is not covered by spots (the hypothetical case), the planet's transit would block some light. So the brightness dip from the planet would be (Rpl²)/(Rstar²) because the area blocked is (π Rpl²)/(π Rstar²) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but the star's brightness is not uniform. The spots are cooler, so when they come into view, the star's overall brightness as observed decreases. So the dip in brightness when the spots are visible is due to the spots being dimmer than the surrounding photosphere.

Wait, no, because when the star rotates and the spots come into view, the observed brightness goes down. So the brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler. So the maximum dip is when the maximum number of spots are visible from our perspective.

But wait, the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star's rotation brings the spotted hemisphere into view, the observed brightness goes down. The opposite hemisphere is unspotted, but when it's visible, the spots are on the other side and don't affect our view.

So the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the maximum area of spots is visible to us. Since spots are on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the entire spotted area contributes to the dip.

Wait, but the star's entire surface isn't spotted. Only one hemisphere has spots, 20% of that hemisphere's area. So when the star is viewed edge-on (as in a transit), the part of the star that's visible is as the star rotates. But for the purpose of the brightness variation due to spots, I think the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is facing us.

So the change in brightness (delta F) would be the sum of the spots' contribution relative to the star's total brightness.

Wait, no, because the star's brightness isn't the same everywhere. The spots are cooler, so they emit less flux. So the dip in brightness when the spots are visible is the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are covering part of the disk.

But wait, the star's total flux when spots are visible is F_total = F_normal * (1 - (A_spot * (F_spot / F_normal)) )

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the flux without spots as F0, and then when a spot is present, it's F0 * (1 - f), where f is the fraction of the area covered, multiplied by the temperature difference.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the total flux without spots being F0 = 4π R² * sigma T^4, but when a spot is present, the flux is F = F0 - (area of spot * sigma T_spot^4) + (area of spot * sigma T0^4) ), since the spot is cooler.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible.

The star's surface, without spots, has a flux per unit area of sigma * T^4.

The spots have a lower temperature, T_spot = T - delta T = 5000 K in this case? Wait, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So if the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spots are at 5000 K.

So the flux from the spots per unit area is sigma * (5000)^4.

The area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²), because a hemisphere is 2π R².

Wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4π R². So a hemisphere is 2π R². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π R² * sigma * (6000)^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux would be F = F0 - (0.4 π R² * sigma (5000)^4) + 0.4 π R² * sigma (6000)^4 ? No, wait, no. Because the spots are replacing the normal surface. So the flux from the spotted area is 0.4 π R² * sigma (5000)^4.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = (4π R² sigma (6000)^4) - (0.4 π R² sigma (6000)^4) + (0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4 )

Wait, that would be F = [4π R² sigma (6000)^4] * (1 - 0.2) ) + [0.2 * 4π R² sigma (5000)^4 ) ] ?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think as follows:

Without any spots, the flux is F0 = 4π R² * sigma (6000)^4.

When the spots are present on a hemisphere, the flux is F = (area_unspotted * sigma T^4) + (area_spotted * sigma T_spot^4).

The area_unspotted is (4π R² - area_spots), but wait, the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when we are viewing the star, the maximum area of spots visible is 0.4 π R², as calculated earlier.

Wait, no, because when the star is viewed from Earth, we can only see a hemisphere. So when the star is rotating and the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots visible is 0.4 π R². So the flux in that case is F_spot_visible = (2π R² - 0.4 π R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * sigma (5000)^4.

But wait, the area of the star's disk we see is π R², since the star's radius is R. So wait, no, the area we see is the area of the disk, which is π (R)^2. But the total surface area of the star is 4π R². So when the star is viewed from Earth, the visible area is a disk of π R².

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try again.

The star's total surface area is 4π R². Each hemisphere is 2π R².

The spots are on one hemisphere, covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the total area of the star is 4π R². The spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us (as in, at a certain phase), the area of spots visible is 0.4 π R².

But the area of the star's disk visible from Earth is π R². So when the star is viewed face-on, the area is π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of spots visible is only that part of the 0.4 π R² that lies within the visible disk.

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to model this as a fraction of the star's disk.

Wait, when the star is viewed from Earth, the disk area is π R². The spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover a certain fraction of the disk.

Wait, but the spots are on the hemisphere, so when the star is viewed such that the hemisphere is facing us, the spots occupy a certain area on the disk.

Hmm, perhaps I should model the area of the disk covered by spots as a fraction of the disk's area. So the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, which is half the star's surface. So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.2 * 2π R²) / (4π R²) ) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the total surface.

But wait, when the star is viewed from Earth, the disk is π R². So if the spots are on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is facing us, the area of the disk covered by spots is (0.2 * 2π R²) / (4π R²) ) * π R²? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the fraction of the disk that is spotted. Since the spots are on a hemisphere, when that hemisphere is visible, the fraction of the disk covered by spots is the same as the filling factor, which is 20%.

Wait, no. Because the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The disk area is π R². So the fraction of the disk covered by spots when the hemisphere is facing us is (0.4 π R²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4, or 40%.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.4 π R² is the area of the spots, which is on the hemisphere. When the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 π R² is on the near side, but the disk area is π R². So the spot coverage is 0.4 / (π R²) * π R²? No, wait, 0.4 π R² is the area of the spots, and the disk is π R². So the fraction is 0.4 π R² / π R² = 0.4, or 40% of the disk is covered by spots.

Wait, that can't be correct, because the hemisphere is only one side. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the surface. So if the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 π R² is part of the disk. So yes, the spots would cover 40% of the disk's area when that hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but 40% of the disk's area would be a significant portion. So when the star is in the phase where that hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 40% of the visible disk. So the dip in brightness would be significant.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed brightness variation is similar to that of a planet. So what's the dip caused by the spots?

The brightness dip (delta F) is the difference between the star's brightness without spots and with spots.

So the star's brightness without spots is F0 = sigma (6000)^4 * 4π R².

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - 0.4 * (sigma (5000)^4 / sigma (6000)^4 )) ).

Wait, no. Because when 40% of the disk is covered by spots, the flux from that part is reduced.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the fractional change in flux. The star's total flux without spots is F0 = 4π R² * sigma T^4.

When 40% of the disk is spotted, the flux is F = (0.6 * 4π R² * sigma (6000)^4 ) + (0.4 * 4π R² * sigma (5000)^4 ) ) * (1/4π R²) * (4π R²) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's model it correctly.

The flux from the star without any spots is F0 = 4π R² * sigma (6000)^4.

When 40% of the disk is covered by spots (i.e., 0.4 * π R²), the flux from the spotted area is 0.4 * π R² * sigma (5000)^4.

The rest of the disk (60% of the disk, 0.6 * π R²) emits at the normal temperature.

So the total flux F is (0.6 * π R² * sigma (6000)^4) + (0.4 * π R² * sigma (5000)^4).

But wait, the total area is π R² (the disk), so the flux is F = (0.6 * sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 * sigma (5000)^4) * π R².

So the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is (F - F0) / F0.

Wait, F0 is the flux when there are no spots, which is (π R² sigma (6000)^4 ). Because the disk area is π R², and each point emits sigma T^4.

Wait, no. Because without spots, the entire disk emits at 6000 K. So F0 = π R² * sigma (6000)^4.

When spots are present, F = (0.6 * π R² * sigma (6000)^4) + (0.4 * π R² * sigma (5000)^4).

So the change in flux is F - F0 = π R² sigma [0.6 (6000^4) + 0.4 (5000^4) - 6000^4 ]

= π R² sigma [ -0.4 (6000^4) + 0.4 (5000^4) ]

= 0.4 * π R² sigma [5000^4 - 6000^4 ]

So the fractional change is (F - F0)/F0 = [0.4 (5000^4 - 6000^4 ) / 6000^4 ].

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute 5000^4 and 6000^4.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

So 5000^4 / 6000^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 5000^4 - 6000^4 = 625e12 - 1296e12 = -671e12. Wait, wait, that's not right. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, 5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 5^4 * (1e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

So 5000^4 = 6.25e14.

So 5000^4 - 6000^4 = 6.25e14 - 1.296e15 = -6.71e14.

Wait, but when I compute the fractional change:

(F - F0)/F0 = [0.4 * (5000^4 - 6000^4)] / (6000^4 )

= 0.4 * (-6.71e14) / (1.296e15 )

= 0.4 * (-6.71 / 1296 ) approximately.

Wait, 6.71e14 over 1.296e15 is 6.71 / 1296 ≈ 0.005178.

So 0.4 * (-0.005178) ≈ -0.002071.

So the fractional change is about -0.00207, or a 0.207% decrease in flux.

Wait, but the fractional change in flux is (F - F0)/F0 = -0.00207.

So the dip in brightness is about 0.207% when the spots are at maximum coverage.

Wait, but this seems small. Is that correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the spots are on a hemisphere, but when the star is viewed from Earth, only part of the hemisphere is visible. Wait, no, when the hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is visible. So the area of the spots is 0.4 pi R², and the disk area is pi R². So the fraction of the disk covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (pi R²) )= 0.4, so 40% of the disk is covered by spots when the hemisphere is facing us.

So that part seems correct.

So the fractional flux change is about -0.2%, which is the dip.

Now, the question is, what planet radius would cause a dip of the same amplitude?

The dip caused by a planet is (Rpl / Rstar )^2, because the area blocked is (pi Rpl^2) / (pi Rstar^2) ) = (Rpl/Rstar )^2.

So we set (Rpl/Rstar )^2 = 0.00207.

Taking square roots, Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.00207) ≈ 0.0455, which is approximately 0.046.

But wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of the options is around 0.046. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the area calculation. Let me reevaluate.

Alternative approach: The flux from the star without spots is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f), where f is the fractional area of the spots times the ratio of their flux.

Alternatively, the spots are cooler, so when they're visible, the flux is reduced by the area of the spots times (1 - (T_spot / T_0)^4 ).

Wait, more accurately, the flux dip is (fraction of area covered) * (1 - (T_spot / T_0)^4 ) * (T_0^4 / (T_0^4)) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the change in flux per unit area. The areas covered by spots emit less flux. So the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is:

delta F / F0 = - (A_spot / A_total_visible) * ( (T_spot^4) / (T_0^4) - 1 )

Wait, no, because the spots are a fraction f of the visible area. So:

F = F0 * [ (1 - f) * 1 + f * (T_spot^4 / T_0^4) ) ]

So delta F / F0 = [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_0^4) ) ] - 1 = - f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_0^4) )

= - f (1 - ( (T_spot / T_0 )^4 ) )

So f is the fraction of the visible area covered by spots.

Wait, but in the earlier example, when the hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the disk covered by spots is 40% (f = 0.4). So:

delta F / F0 = -0.4 (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 = approximately 0.8333^2 = 0.6944; squared again, ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So delta F/F0 = -0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ -0.207, which is a 20.7% dip? Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation with the same numbers gave a 0.2% dip. Wait, I'm confused.

Wait, wait no. Let me clarify.

Wait, another approach: the star's total flux when spots are present is the sum of the flux from the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The total flux without spots is F0 = sigma T_0^4 * (pi R^2 ), because the disk area is pi R^2.

When spots are present, the flux is F = (1 - f) * sigma T0^4 * pi R² + f * sigma T_spot^4 * pi R².

So delta F = F - F0 = [ (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / T0^4) ] * sigma T0^4 pi R² - sigma T0^4 pi R².

Wait, no, F0 is sigma T0^4 * pi R².

F = sigma T0^4 * ( (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T0^4) ) * pi R².

So F = F0 * [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T0^4) ) ]

So delta F = F - F0 = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T0^4) ) - 1 ]

= F0 [ -f + f (T_spot^4 / T0^4) ) ]

= F0 [ -f (1 - T_spot^4 / T0^4 ) ]

So delta F / F0 = - f (1 - (T_spot / T0 )^4 )

So f is the fraction of the disk covered by spots, which is 0.4 in our case.

So delta F/F0 = -0.4 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

As before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So delta F/F0 = -0.4 * 0.51775 ≈ -0.2071.

So the fractional flux change is -20.71%, which is a 20.7% dip in brightness.

Wait, that's a big dip. I thought earlier that the dip was 0.2%, but that was incorrect. Because the initial approach was wrong, I think.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the area.

Wait, when the star is viewed from Earth, the area we see is the disk, pi R².

The spots are on a hemisphere, which when facing us, the area of the spots visible is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R². The area of the disk is pi R², so the fraction f is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4, so f = 0.4.

So indeed, delta F/F0 is about -0.207, or 20.7% dip.

But wait, that's a huge dip. How can that be? A 20% dip is more than what a Jupiter-sized planet would cause.

Wait, but in reality, starspots are much smaller than the entire hemisphere. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots are 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 20% of 2 pi R².

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The disk area is pi R², so the fraction of the disk covered by spots is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4, so 40%. That's a lot, but the problem says so.

So the dip is -20.7%, which is about 0.207 in fractional terms.

But wait, exoplanets cause dips in brightness when they transit. The dip is (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is planet radius, R_s is star radius.

So we have:

(R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.207.

So R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.207 ) ≈ 0.455.

Hmm, that's about 45% of the star's radius. But the options don't have anything near 0.45. The closest is option A: ~0.39, which is about 0.4.

But wait, let's recheck the calculations.

Wait, the Teff is 6000 K. So T0=6000, T_spot=5000.

(T_spot / T0 )^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So f=0.4.

So delta F/F0 = -0.4 * 0.51775 ≈ -0.207.

So (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.207 → R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.455.

But the options don't have 0.45. The closest is option A: ~0.39, which is about 0.39.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's said that the star has a radius equal to the Sun. So Rstar = R_sun. So R_p would be approximately 0.455 R_sun, which is much larger than Jupiter. Jupiter's radius is about 0.1 R_sun.

Wait, but that can't be right, because 0.45 R_sun is a planet as large as a small star, which is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the area of the spots as a fraction of the star's total surface is 20% of a hemisphere, which is 10% of the total surface. But when viewed from Earth, only a part of the hemisphere is visible, so the fraction of the disk covered by spots is less.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the way I calculated f. Let's think again.

The star's total surface area is 4 pi R².

The spots are on one hemisphere (2 pi R²), covering 20% of that hemisphere. So area_spots = 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

When the star is viewed from Earth, the disk area is pi R².

The fraction of the disk covered by spots, f_disk, is area_spots_visible / disk_area.

When the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 pi R² is within the disk. So f_disk = 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4.

So f_disk = 0.4.

So the dip is 20.7%, as calculated.

But that's a very large dip for a planet. So perhaps the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, which would be the same as the maximum dip. So the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p / R_s )^2.

So we set (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.207 → R_p/R_s ≈ sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.455.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the f calculation.

Wait, perhaps the star's rotation makes the spots appear as a modulation, but the area that is visible depends on the viewing angle. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip is 40% of the disk, but perhaps I should be considering the average effect.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet, implying that the amplitude is similar. So perhaps the dip is 20.7%, which would require a planet radius of about 0.45 Rstar.

But the options don't have that. The closest is A) 0.39. Maybe it's a rounding issue.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (T_spot / T_0 )^4.

Let me compute (5000/6000)^4 precisely.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) )= 625 / 1296.

625 ÷ 1296 = approximately 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

So 0.4 * 0.517747 = 0.2070988.

So the fractional dip is approximately -0.2071, or 20.71% dip.

So the planet radius would be R_p = Rstar * sqrt(0.2071) ≈ Rstar * 0.455.

Which is about 0.455 Rstar.

But the options don't have anything close. So perhaps I messed up the area calculation.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the spots are on one hemisphere, but when the star rotates, only a part of that hemisphere is visible from Earth, so the maximum f is less than 0.4.

Wait, but when the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 pi R² is within the disk. So f would be 0.4.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the star's rotation period is such that the spots rotate into view, but perhaps the maximum area is 40% of the disk, but perhaps the average is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as a darkening on the hemisphere, but the brightness variation is due to the spots moving in and out of view, which could average out to a certain dip.

Wait, but the question states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet, suggesting that the amplitude is the same as a planet transit.

So perhaps the dip is 20.7%, which would require a planet of radius 0.455 Rstar.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake in the filling factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not the hemisphere.

That would make the area of spots 0.2 * 4 pi R² = 0.8 pi R².

But when the star is viewed, the maximum area of spots visible is 0.8 pi R², but the disk is pi R², so f=0.8 pi R² / pi R² = 0.8.

Which would make the dip much larger: f=0.8.

delta F/F0 = -0.8 * (1 - (0.8333)^4 ) = -0.8 * 0.51775 ≈ -0.4142.

That's a 41% dip, which would require a planet radius of sqrt(0.4142) ≈ 0.643 Rstar. But that's not an option either.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the filling factor.

The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So area_spots = 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

So when the star is viewed, the maximum f is 0.4.

Hmm.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view and go out of view, so the average brightness variation might be less. But the question refers to the amplitude of the signal, which is the maximum dip.

So I think the dip is 20.7%, requiring R_p/R_s ≈ 0.455.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation caused by the spots as the same as the planet's transit depth.

The transit depth is (R_p / R_s )^2.

The star's brightness variation due to spots is the difference between the unspotted brightness and the spotted brightness.

Wait, earlier I calculated the dip as 20.7%, but perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the difference between maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, when the star is unspotted (as seen from Earth), the brightness is F0.

When the spots are facing us, the brightness is F = F0 * (1 - 0.4 * 0.51775 ) = F0 * (1 - 0.2071) = 0.7929 F0.

So the dip is 20.71%, as before.

So to have a dip of 20.71% from a planet, R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455.

But none of the options match.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is wrong because the brightness variation due to spots isn't a dip, but a variation caused by the rotation of the star, which alternates between unspotted and spotted regions.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness without spots is F0. When the spots are on the near side, the brightness is F = F0 * (1 - 0.4 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )) = F0 * (1 - 0.4 * 0.51775) = F0 * (1 - 0.2071) = 0.7929 F0.

So the dip is 20.71%, as before.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness due to the spots coming into view as the star rotates, which alternates between F0 and F. So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be (F0 - F)/F0 * 100% = 20.71%, which would require the planet's dip to be the same, 20.71%, which would require R_p = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me re-express the problem.

Another approach: The problem states that the star's brightness variation resembles an exoplanet. So perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as that caused by the planet.

The amplitude is the difference between maximum and minimum brightness.

In the case of the star with spots, the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (F0), and the minimum is when the maximum area of spots is visible (F_min).

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Wait, no, the amplitude is the change in brightness, which is F_max - F_min. But in the case of a planet transit, the maximum dip is (R_p / R_star)^2.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude is the maximum dip, which is 20.7% for the star.

So the planet's dip would have to be 20.7%, requiring R_p/Rstar = ~0.455.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering that the spots are on only one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots are sometimes on the visible side and sometimes not. So the average brightness variation would be less than the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps the observed brightness variation is the difference between when the spot hemisphere is facing us and when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us.

Wait, but the unspotted hemisphere would have no spots, so its flux would be F0.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - 0.4 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )) = 0.7929 F0.

So the brightness variation amplitude would be (F0 - F)/F0 = 0.2071, or 20.71%.

But perhaps the problem is considering the variation as the difference between the two hemispheres.

Wait, the unspotted hemisphere has flux F0, the spotted hemisphere has flux F = (0.6 * F0) + (0.4 * F_spot). Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

No, because the entire hemisphere is either unspotted or spotted. No, the spots are only on one hemisphere, which when facing us, the spots are on the visible hemisphere. The other hemisphere is unspotted.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, which is F0, and the minimum brightness is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, which is F = F0 * (1 - 0.4 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )) = 0.7929 F0.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is F0 - F = 0.2071 F0, which is a 20.71% dip.

So for the planet, the transit would cause a dip of (R_p / R_s )^2 F0.

Setting this equal to 0.2071 F0, we get R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, when the star is viewed from Earth, the area of the disk is pi R². The spots are on a hemisphere, but when the hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots on the disk is 0.4 pi R², which is 40% of the disk.

So f = 0.4.

So I think the calculation is correct, but the options don't match. So perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So are the spots at 5000 K, or 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K?

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only a single spot, not the entire 20% of the hemisphere. But no, the problem states a filling factor of 20% on the hemisphere.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view, causing the star's brightness to vary. The amplitude of this variation is the same as the planet's transit depth.

But the planet's transit depth is (R_p / R_s )^2.

So to find R_p, set (R_p/R_s )^2 = delta F.

But delta F is 0.2071.

So R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.2071) = approximately 0.455.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the flux calculation. Let me try another way.

The star's flux without spots is F0 = sigma (6000)^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2.

When the spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (area_spots * sigma (6000^4) ) + (area_spots * sigma (5000^4) )

= F0 - area_spots * sigma (6000^4 - 5000^4 )

But area_spots is 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

So F = F0 - 0.4 pi Rstar^2 * sigma (6000^4 - 5000^4 )

The fractional change is (F - F0)/F0 = [ -0.4 pi Rstar^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ sigma 4 pi Rstar^2 (6000^4) ]

= [ -0.4 pi R^2 (6e3^4 -5e3^4) sigma ] / [ 4 pi R^2 sigma 6e3^4 )

= [ -0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4) ] / [4 * 6e3^4 ]

Calculate numerator: 6e3^4 = 1.296e15, 5e3^4 = 6.25e14.

6e3^4 -5e3^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

So numerator is -0.4 * 6.71e14 = -2.684e14.

Denominator is 4 * 1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So delta F/F0 = (-2.684e14) / (5.184e15 ) ≈ -0.0517.

So about a 5.17% dip.

Ah! That's different. So the dip is 5.17%.

Wait, that's a big difference from the previous calculation.

Where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, I think I confused the area being considered. In this approach, the star's total surface area is 4 pi R^2. The spots are 0.4 pi R².

So when the star is viewed from Earth, the area of the disk is pi R². The spots cover 0.4 pi R² of the disk.

Wait, no, because the spots are on a hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.4 pi R² of the disk. So the fractional area is 0.4.

But in this calculation, the denominator is F0 = 4 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4.

Wait, but when we compute the flux, it's the sum of all the star's surface. So when the star is viewed from Earth, we only see a fraction of its surface. So perhaps the correct approach is to model the star's brightness as the sum of the visible part and the hidden part, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong because it considered the entire star's surface, but when viewed from Earth, only part of the star's surface is visible.

So perhaps the correct way is to model the flux as the sum of the flux from the visible area (disk) and the flux from the hidden area.

Wait, but the star emits uniformly (without spots), so the total flux is F0 = 4 pi R² sigma T^4.

When the disk is viewed, the flux is F_visible = pi R² sigma T^4.

The hidden area (4 pi R² - pi R²) contributes F_hidden = 3 pi R² sigma T^4.

But when the star rotates, the visible area changes.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternative approach: The brightness variation due to spots is when the spots come into view, causing a dip. The dip is the difference between the unspotted flux and the spotted flux.

The unspotted flux is F_unspotted = sigma T^4 * pi R².

The spotted flux when the spots are visible is F_spotted = (pi R² - A_spots ) sigma T^4 + A_spots sigma T_spot^4.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted = [ pi R² sigma T^4 ] - [ (pi R² - A_spots) sigma T^4 + A_spots sigma T_spot^4 ]

= pi R² sigma T^4 - pi R² sigma T^4 + A_spots sigma T^4 - A_spots sigma T_spot^4

= A_spots sigma ( T^4 - T_spot^4 )

The fractional dip is [ A_spots sigma (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (pi R² sigma T^4 )

= [ A_spots ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / ( pi R² T^4 )

A_spots is 0.4 pi R², as before.

So substituting:

= [ 0.4 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / ( pi R² 6000^4 )

= 0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) / 6e3^4.

Compute 6e3^4 = 1.296e15, 5e3^4 = 6.25e14.

So 6e3^4 -5e3^4 = 6.71e14.

So:

= 0.4 * 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.4 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.2071.

So the dip is 20.71%, same as before.

Hmm. So according to this, the dip is 20.71%, which requires a planet radius of 0.455 Rstar, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm calculating the dip incorrectly. Let me think again.

Wait, when the spots are on the star's surface, they reduce the total flux. But when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, the dip is larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star is only emitting from the hemisphere we see, and the other hemisphere is not emitting. No, that's not correct because the star emits from all surfaces.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the effective temperature is given, and the spots are cooler, but the star's overall flux remains the same except when the spots are in view.

Wait, no, the star's total flux is F0 = 4 pi R² sigma T^4. When the spots are present, the total flux is F = (4 pi R² - A_spots ) sigma T^4 + A_spots sigma T_spot^4.

So the total flux when spots are present is F = F0 - A_spots sigma ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ).

The dip in flux is F0 - F = A_spots sigma ( T^4 - T_spot^4 ).

But when the star is viewed from Earth, we only see a fraction of the star's surface, which is the disk, pi R².

So the observed dip in brightness would be the difference between the unspotted disk flux and the spotted disk flux.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the observed flux as the sum of the visible area and the hidden area, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering the relative brightness variation as the same as the planet's transit, which would be (R_p/Rstar )^2.

So to find R_p such that (R_p/Rstar )^2 equals the dip caused by the spots.

But the dip is 20.7%, so R_p/Rstar is sqrt(0.207 ) ≈ 0.455.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Let me compute (5/6)^4 again.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

(0.833333)^4 = ?

0.8333^2 = 0.694444.

0.694444^2 = approx 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So the dip is 0.4 * 0.51775 = 0.2071.

So 20.71% dip.

But the options don't match, so perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the rotation of the star, not the maximum dip. That is, the star's brightness varies as it rotates, and the amplitude of this variation is the same as the planet's transit.

In this case, the average brightness variation would be the difference between when the spot hemisphere is facing us and when it's not.

So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, brightness is F1 = F0 * (1 - 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )) = F0 * (1 - 0.2 * 0.51775 )= F0 * (1 - 0.10355 ) = F0 * 0.89645.

When the other hemisphere is facing us, brightness is F0.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F0 - F1 ) = F0 (1 - 0.89645 ) = 0.10355 F0.

So the dip amplitude is about 10.355%.

So the planet's transit dip would be 10.355% → (R_p/Rstar )^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, matching option D.

Ah! So perhaps I was mistaken earlier. The problem is not about the maximum dip when the entire spot area is visible, but about the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the star's rotation, which alternates between the spot hemisphere and the unspotted hemisphere.

So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is F1 = F0 * (1 - 0.2 * 0.51775 ) = F0 * 0.89645.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is F0.

So the amplitude is (F0 - F1 ) = 0.10355 F0, which is a 10.355% dip.

So the planet's transit dip would be the same, 10.355% → (R_p/Rstar )^2 = 0.10355 → R_p = 0.3218 Rstar, which is approximately 0.32, option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = -f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right),
     \]
     where \( f \) is the fraction of the disk covered by spots.

3. **Fraction of Disk Covered by Spots**:
   - The area of the spotted hemisphere is \( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the spots cover 20% of this area, so the total spotted area is \( 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The visible disk area is \( \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), so the fraction of the disk covered by spots is:
     \[
     f = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.4.
     \]

4. **Calculation of Brightness Variation**:
   - Substituting \( f = 0.4 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225.
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = -0.4 \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = -0.4 \times 0.51775 \approx -0.2071.
     \]
     This corresponds to a **20.71% dip in brightness** when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

5. **Comparison to Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \left| \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} \right|.
     \]
   - Setting \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.2071 \), we solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.2071} \approx 0.455.
     \]

6. **Revisiting the Brightness Variation**:
   - The problem specifies that the brightness variation caused by the spots resembles an exoplanet transit. However, the **amplitude of the brightness variation** due to the star's rotation is not the maximum dip but the difference between the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible and when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is \( F_0 \). When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = F_0 \times (1 - 0.2 \times 0.51775) = F_0 \times 0.89645.
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_0 - F_{\text{spotted}} = F_0 - 0.89645 F_0 = 0.10355 F_0.
     \]
     This corresponds to a **10.355% dip in brightness**.

7. **Final Calculation for Exoplanet**:
   - Setting \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355 \), we solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**, which matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
