Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least ħ/2. Or was it ħ? Let me think. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe I'm mixing this up with something else. Oh, no, wait, I think it's ħ over two, but sometimes people use the approximation without the ½ factor. Hmm.

So the idea is that the shorter the lifetime (Δt) of a state, the less precisely we can know its energy. Because a shorter Δt implies a larger uncertainty ΔE, right? So the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, their energies would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but in this problem, each state has its own lifetime. Oh, wait no, wait. The two states have different lifetimes. So perhaps each state has a certain uncertainty in energy. But we're looking for the energy difference between E2 and E1, let's say ΔE = E2 - E1. We need this ΔE to be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that they can be resolved.

Hmm, but how exactly do the lifetimes relate to the energy uncertainty? Oh, right! The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt) of the state. So for each state, ΔE = ħ / (Δt). But which Δt do we use here? Wait, the two states have different lifetimes. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Because each state's energy is uncertain by its own ΔE. So the minimum ΔE required for them to be distinguishable would be when ΔE is greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Or wait, maybe the maximum uncertainty is the larger of the two. Let me think.

Wait, let me get the formula straight. For a single state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime of the state. So for the first state, which has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 sec, ΔE1 = ħ/(τ1). Similarly, for the second state, τ2= 1e-8 sec, ΔE2= ħ/(τ2). But wait, since τ2 is larger than τ1, ΔE2 would be smaller than ΔE1. Because a longer lifetime implies a more precise energy measurement.

But wait, the problem is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two energies would overlap, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, no. Let's think again. Each state's energy is known within a certain uncertainty. The actual energy of each is E1 ± ΔE1 and E2 ± ΔE2. To distinguish them, the lower end of E2 must be higher than the upper end of E1. So E2 - ΔE2 > E1 + ΔE1. So the energy difference ΔE (E2 - E1) must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). That makes sense.

So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But wait, maybe it's just the larger of the two uncertainties? No, because if the difference is larger than the sum, then it's definitely larger than either individually. So the correct condition is ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

Now, let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV and the time is given in seconds, I'll need to convert the units properly.

Wait, another approach: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2 in eV.

Compute ΔE1 = ħ / τ1. And similarly ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

So let's compute them.

First, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert that to eV: since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so J to eV is divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.0545718e-25)/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ (1.0545718 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV.

Let me compute 1.0545718 / 1.602 ≈ approximately 0.658. So 0.658e-6 eV is 6.58e-7 eV. So ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, wait wait. Wait, 1e-25 divided by 1e-19 is 1e-6. So 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 = (1.05 / 1.6) * 1e-6 eV. 1.05/1.6 is about 0.656, so 0.656e-6 eV = 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2=1e-8 s, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2 = (1.05e-34 J·s)/(1e-8 s) = 1.05e-26 J. Converting to eV:

1.05e-26 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = (1.05 / 1.6) * 1e-7 eV. 1.05/1.6≈0.656, so 0.656e-7 eV = 6.56e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.56e-7 eV, ΔE2≈6.56e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Because in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, ΔE * Δt >= ħ/2. So perhaps we should be using ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), or maybe it's more accurate to use ħ/(Δt) as an approximation, but perhaps the exact factor isn't as important since the options are varying by several orders of magnitude.

But regardless, the sum of ΔE1 + ΔE2 is 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 = (6.56 * (1 + 0.1))e-7 = 6.56 * 1.1 * 1e-7 = approximately 7.216e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than approximately 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is 0.001e-6 eV. That's way smaller than 7.2e-7 eV. So not enough.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, way larger than 7.2e-7. So this would work, because it's much bigger.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 eV is 0.00000001 eV. That's 1e-8, which is 1e-8. Hmm, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is less than 7.2e-7 eV. So D is 1e-8, which is smaller than the required 7.2e-7 eV. So not sufficient.

Wait, but wait. Hmm. So only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 7.2e-7. So that's way larger than needed. So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, why is the computed sum 7.2e-7 eV, and option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger. So that would make sense.

Wait, but let me think again. The sum of the uncertainties is about 7.2e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than this would allow the two states to be distinguished. So the correct option must be one where the energy difference is greater than 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 < 7.2e-7 → no.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is 100e-6, which is larger than 7.2e-7 → yes.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV → 1e-8 < 7.2e-7 → no.

So the only option that is larger is C.

Wait, but wait another point. Maybe I should think about the total uncertainty in energy between the two states. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference has to be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties, not the sum. Because the uncertainty of each state is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So the energy levels can only be resolved if ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Or is it ΔE > max(ΔE1, ΔE2)?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the experiment. Suppose you have two peaks in a spectrum. For them to be distinguishable, the separation between their peaks must be greater than the sum of their FWHM (full width at half maximum), which is proportional to the uncertainty. So I think the condition is indeed ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So in that case, as calculated, the required ΔE is about 7.2e-7 eV, so any option with ΔE larger than that would work.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger (1e-4 is 100e-6, which is 100 times larger than 7.2e-7 eV). So that's the right choice.

Wait, but I'm mixing up the units. Let me recheck the calculations for ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05457e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV → 1e-25 J = 1e-25 / 1.602e-19 eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (1.05457e-34 J·s)/(1e-8 s) = 1.05457e-26 J → 1e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So sum is 7.2e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 7.2e-7 eV. So any option that's larger than that is acceptable.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV or 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 7.2e-7. So that's way bigger. So the correct answer is C.


To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties, which are determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: 

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

For a state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in energy are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \, \text{J} \div 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \, \text{J} \div 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
