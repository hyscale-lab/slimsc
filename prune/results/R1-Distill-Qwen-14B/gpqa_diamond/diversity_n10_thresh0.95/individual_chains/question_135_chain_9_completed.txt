Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decays, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think that's a typo in the way it's written here. Maybe it should be something like -λ f ψ_f(y) X(y) ψ_f(y) multiplied by (ῡ + X(y))? Or perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction where X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

Wait, the mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So the question is about the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order.

I remember that for a particle to decay into a pair of particles, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of each of the particles in the pair. Because energy and momentum have to be conserved, so the decay products can't have more energy than what's available.

So first, I need to figure out the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. The options are given as A, B, C, D. Each option lists different possible decay products.

Let's list out all the possible fermion pairs in each option:

Option A: b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option C: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option D: b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait—what's the mass of X? 6 GeV. So each decay product pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

First, I need to recall the masses of the fermions involved.

Let me list out the masses of the quarks and leptons:

- Up quark (u): mass is about 2.2 MeV (so negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- Down quark (d): similar to u, around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): around 100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): about 173 GeV (way too heavy, since X is 6 GeV)
- Tau lepton (tau): about 1.777 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
- Anti-particles have the same mass as their counterparts.

So for X to decay into a pair of particles (like f fbar), the mass of each f must be such that 2 * m_f <= m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So 2*m_f <=6 GeV → m_f <=3 GeV.

Let's see which fermions satisfy this.

- u: 2.2 MeV → yes
- d: ~5 MeV → yes
- s: ~100 MeV → yes
- c: ~1.5 GeV → 1.5 *2=3 GeV → yes, exactly 3 GeV.
- b: ~4.7 GeV → 4.7 *2=9.4 GeV. X is only 6 GeV → no. So b quarks are too heavy.
- t: too heavy, as 173 GeV is way above.
- Tau: 1.777 GeV → 2*1.777 ~3.554 GeV. So 3.554 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so yes, X can decay into tau+ tau-.
- e: negligible, so yes.
- mu: ~0.105 GeV → 2*0.105=0.21 GeV. Yes.

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are u, d, s, c, tau, e, mu.

But wait, what about the top quark? No, because that's way too heavy.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is too heavy. So X can't decay into b bbar because 2*4.7 GeV=9.4 GeV >6 GeV. So A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all those fermion pairs have 2*m_f <=6 GeV.

Option C includes t, which is impossible, so C is out.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So D is out.

So the allowed options are B and the others that don't have b or t.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, what about the c quark? Its mass is about 1.5 GeV. So 2*1.5 = 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into c cbar.

So from the options, the correct one would be B, because it includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All these have 2*m_f <=6 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Do I need to consider the possibility of the interaction terms? The Lagrangian given is L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe I misread it. Let me look again.

The problem states the interaction Lagrangian is:

\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)

Wait, that might not make sense. Typically, the Yukawa interaction is something like \lambda \bar\psi \phi \psi, where phi is the scalar field (boson). But here, it's written as (ῡ + X), which might be a typo, maybe it's (v + X), where v is the vacuum expectation value. Or perhaps the actual term is \bar{\psi} (X) \psi, but the presence of v suggests it's an interaction with a scalar field at some scale.

But regardless, the key point is the interaction term allows the X boson to couple to fermion-antifermion pairs. So the decay channels are f fbar for any fermion f that X can interact with.

Assuming that the interaction term is such that X couples to all the fermions mentioned in the options, then it's just a matter of kinematics.

So the possible decay products are all pairs where the mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV per particle.

So the allowed are:

u, d, s, c, tau, mu, e.

So the decay channels would be uū, dđ, sŝ, cĉ, taū, mu+, mu-, e+ e-.

So looking at the options, option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option A includes b, which is too heavy. So B is correct.

Wait, the options are:

Option B) X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed fermion pairs.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order, we analyze the given Lagrangian interaction term and the mass of \( X \), which is 6 GeV. The interaction term allows \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)), provided the combined mass of the decay products does not exceed the mass of \( X \). Specifically, the mass of each fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays
The masses of the fermions are as follows:
- \( u \): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_u \approx 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed)
- \( d \): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_d \approx 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed)
- \( s \): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_s \approx 200 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed)
- \( c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_c \approx 3.0 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed)
- \( b \): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed)
- \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed)
- \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed)
- \( e \): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_e \approx 1.022 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed)
- \( \mu \): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_\mu \approx 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed)

From this, the allowed fermion pairs are \( u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). The \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \) pairs are not allowed because their masses exceed the threshold \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
