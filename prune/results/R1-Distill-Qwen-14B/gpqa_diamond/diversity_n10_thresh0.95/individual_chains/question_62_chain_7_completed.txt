Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably draw the structures of the starting material and the target to visualize what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane has a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. The target molecule seems to have a cyclohexyl group attached to a carbon that's also connected to a hydroxyl group and a methyl group, and then another cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me try to parse the name.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Breaking it down: the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at position 1 (assuming numbering starts where the CHO is), there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, it's like cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane ring where the aldehyde is.

Wait, no, maybe it's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So it's a methyl group with two substituents: one cyclohexyl and one hydroxyl. So the structure is probably a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group, and at position 1, a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. Hmm, I think I need to imagine the molecule correctly.

The starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, has a triple bond. Triple bonds can undergo various reactions, like addition, hydration, or other modifications. Since the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a carbon, perhaps we're looking at some kind of cyclopropanation or ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe we're adding groups to the triple bond.

Let me think about the steps needed. The target has a hydroxyl group attached, so maybe there's an epoxidation or oxidation step, but more likely, perhaps a hydroxylation step. Also, the presence of a formyl group suggests a carbonyl might be formed, perhaps via oxidation. But wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's see: the ethynyl group is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane?

Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH2- group. Or is it cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached? No, wait, ethyne is HC≡CH, so ethynyl would be -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent.

So the structure is:

Cyclohexane ring with a -CH2-C≡C- group? Or is it directly attached? Wait, maybe the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH2 group. Or perhaps it's cyclohexane with a vinyl group, but with a triple bond. Let me try to confirm. Ethynylcyclohexane is probably cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH2 group? No, perhaps it's cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group. So the triple bond is between the cyclohexane's carbon and the next carbon, which is attached to hydrogen.

Wait, no. The ethynyl group is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So it's cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, the ethynyl group is -C≡CH, which is a substituent attached directly to the cyclohexane carbon. So cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

So, when we look at the target molecule, it has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is then attached to another cyclohexane ring with a formyl group. Hmm, maybe we're doing some kind of cyclopropanation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is involved in forming a ring. Let me think about possible reactions for ethynylcyclohexane.

One common reaction for terminal alkynes is hydration to form ketones. For example, using H2SO4, HgSO4, and H2O (hydration), a terminal alkyne will form a ketone. So ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexanecarbaldehyde if it's hydrated. Wait, no: ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH) would, upon hydration with H2SO4, HgSO4, and H2O, form cyclohexanecarboxylic acid? Or maybe cyclohexanecarbonyl group. Wait, hydration of an alkyne adds water across the triple bond. For terminal alkynes (HC≡C-R), hydration gives R-C(OH)-CH2-OH? No, wait. Let me recall: hydration of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) with H2SO4 and HgSO4 as catalyst adds water to give a ketone. So R-C≡CH → R-C(O)-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, hydration would add H2O across the triple bond, so the triple bond (sp hybridized) becomes a carbonyl group (sp²). Wait, no. For a terminal alkyne, adding water under acidic conditions (H2SO4, HgSO4) would give a ketone. So for HC≡C-R, the product would be R-C(O)-CH3? Or maybe R-C(OH)-CH3? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the hydration of an internal alkyne, like RC≡CR', would form a ketone R-C(O)-CR'2, but for a terminal alkyne, like RC≡CH, the hydration would give R-C(OH)-CH3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the typical product of ethynyl group hydration. Oh wait, in this case, the triple bond is at the end. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Hydration of a terminal alkyne typically gives a ketone. So, adding HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O would add water across the triple bond, converting it into a ketone. So the product would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? Wait, no, the product would be (cyclohexyl)acetaldehyde, perhaps. Wait, no, wait: the alkyne is CH2-CH2-C≡CH? No, the alkyne is directly attached to the cyclohexane ring. Let me think: if the starting material is cyclohexane-C≡CH, and we add H2O across the triple bond, we'd get cyclohexane-C(OH)=CH2. Wait, no, because hydration tends to form a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the number of carbons. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. So when we add water, the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a carbonyl (C=O). So the triple bond between two carbons, adding H and OH. So perhaps the product would be cyclohexane-C(O)-CH3, which is cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde? Or cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? Wait, no. Wait, the alkyne is -C≡CH, so adding H and OH would make it -COOH? No, wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possible reagents in the options to see what steps are involved.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, but option A has four steps, but the list only has three steps. Wait, perhaps a typo. Let's check:

Option A lists steps 1,2,3, but then step 4 is same as 3? Or perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Looking back:

Options:

Option A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, no, I think in the question, option A's step 4 is same as step 3. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the user wrote:

Options:
A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O
Wait, that can't be right. It says step 3 twice with different reagents. That's probably a mistake, perhaps the user mistyped. Let me check the original question again.

Wait, perhaps it's option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, perhaps the steps involve alkyne reactions, like forming a trans double bond, or perhaps a ring-opening.

Wait, let's think about the target again. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is then attached to another cyclohexane ring with a formyl group. So perhaps it's a case of forming a new ring or adding substituents.

Another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that's cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So perhaps the starting ethynylcyclohexane is being functionalized to add this substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is being converted into a carbonyl group, then some kind of cyclopropanation or ring-expansion is happening. Alternatively, maybe a [2+2] cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: the target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl substituent with a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, then undergoing some kind of oxidation or ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve the following:

1. React ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to form some kind of quaternary ammonium salt? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So perhaps the alkyne is being deprotonated and then methylated. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne (C≡CH), which is acidic. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give the cyclohexyl acetylide ion.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. Reacting the acetylide with methyl chloride would alkylate it, adding a methyl group. So the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C-) would attack the methyl chloride, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So the product would be 1-methylcyclohexylcyclopropane? No, wait, maybe not. Wait, the alkyne is -C≡CH, so deprotonating would give -C≡C^- Na^+.

Adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would give -C≡C-CH3. So the product after step 1 would be 1-methylcyclohexylcyclopropane? Wait, no, the product would be 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne, which is 1-methylcyclohexylacetylene. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but then step 2 in option A is H2/Pd. Hydrogenation of the triple bond would add H2 across the triple bond, converting it into a single bond. So cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be a single bond, so ethane. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would typically reduce it to a single bond (alkane). So the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but in the target, after the first step, perhaps we have a cyclohexyl group attached via a single bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after the first step, the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a methyl group, and then hydrogenated to a single bond. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes methylcyclohexyl ethane.

But I'm not seeing how that directly leads to the target. The target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl substituent with a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl group, which would then be oxidized or something.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the possible steps each option uses.

Looking at option C: steps are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

So step 1: deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide, then methylate to get cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Hydrogenation with H2 and Pd-CaCO3 would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or wait, no, the triple bond is between cyclohexyl and CH3, so hydrogenation would make it a single bond, so cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? But I'm not sure.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of an alkene cleaves it into carbonyl groups. But if the product after step 2 is an alkane, then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So maybe I'm getting the steps wrong.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the compound is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2 is hydrogenation, which would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Which is a single bond, so no double bond for ozonolysis.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that doesn't go all the way, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: after step 1, the compound is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2 is H2 and Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond, so that wouldn't work.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong options. Let me check another option.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/LiNH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a methylating agent? So perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. But wait, methanol is not a good methylating agent. Maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction? Or maybe it's a deprotonation to form an acetylide, followed by something else.

Wait, NaNH2 in methanol might be used for deprotonating an alkyne to form the acetylide, but then what would happen? If the alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane, deprotonating would give the acetylide, which could then react with a methylating agent. But if step 2 is Li/LiNH3, that's a strong base used for elimination or deprotonation, perhaps forming a cyclopropane via Simmons-Smith reaction? Wait, Simmons-Smith uses Zn(Cu), not Li. Alternatively, it's used for deprotonating something else.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction to form a cyclopropane. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the acetylide, step 2 is a lithium-based reaction to form a new ring. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the target again. The target has a formyl group (CHO), which suggests that perhaps an aldehyde is being formed. How can we get an aldehyde from the starting material?

Wait, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, then further oxidized or modified. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is first functionalized into a carbonyl.

Looking at the options, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the standard conditions for hydration of an alkyne to a ketone. So if the starting material went through a series of steps and ended up with an alkyne that could be hydrated, then that step would form a ketone.

Wait, but in option A, the steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride

2. H2/Pd

3. Ba(OH)2

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Hmm, what would each step do?

Step 1: Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, then methyl chloride would methylate it to form cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination reactions, perhaps. So if the compound is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, treating with Ba(OH)2 might not do much. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a dihydroxylation or epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are different. Maybe after step 1, the methylated compound is a cyclohexylacetylene, which upon hydrogenation becomes a cyclohexylpropane. But I'm not seeing how that leads to the target.

Wait, maybe option C is the right one. Let's see:

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the triple bond to single bond, so cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → but wait, ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. If the compound after step 2 is an alkane, there's no double bond. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete. Oh wait! Wait, no, H2 and Pd would likely hydrogenate a triple bond all the way to a single bond. So no double bond left for ozonolysis. So perhaps option C isn't the right path.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about the steps. Let me think about another approach.

The target has a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon that's connected to a cyclohexyl group and a methyl group (from the name: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So perhaps that carbon is formed via some kind of addition reaction, maybe from an epoxide or through a Grignard reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl group, which is then used in a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, another idea: maybe the starting material undergoes a hydration to form a ketone, then some kind of oxidation or aldehyde formation. But looking at the options, option A's step 4 is the hydration, which suggests that the triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl group.

Let's imagine the steps for option A:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Hmm, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used in elimination reactions. So if we have cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, treating with Ba(OH)2 might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol elimination, but without a diol, that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the target structure. The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group. So perhaps the starting material's triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, in option C, step 3 is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups. So if after step 2, the compound has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it.

Let me try to think through option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → reduces triple bond to single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's an alkane, so no double bond. So step 3, ozonolysis, wouldn't do anything. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option C is a different hydrogenation condition. Maybe it's a partial hydrogenation to a double bond. But I thought H2 and Pd would hydrogenate all the way. Alternatively, maybe the catalyst is poisoned to stop at the alkene.

Wait, H2 and Pd on calcium carbonate is a typical catalyst for full hydrogenation. So I think it would reduce the triple bond to a single bond.

Hmm, maybe I'm not looking at the correct options. Let me think again.

The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So perhaps the starting alkyne is being converted into a ketone, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but oxidation of a ketone wouldn't give an aldehyde. Wait, maybe the starting alkyne is being converted into a ketone via hydration, and then perhaps another functional group is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl, then some kind of aldehyde is formed.

Wait, let's consider option B: steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/LiNH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Step 1: Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide, then ethyl chloride would ethylate it, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/LiNH3 is a strong base, perhaps used for elimination. Maybe it induces some kind of elimination to form a triple bond again, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation to form a lithium acetylide, which could then undergo some cyclopropanation. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3/ H2O would ozonolyse any double bonds. But if the compound after step 2 is a longer alkyne, maybe it's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the alkyne is converted into an alkene via some reaction, but I'm not certain.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try another approach: think about the possible steps that could build the target molecule.

The target has a formyl group (from cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring.

So perhaps the starting alkyne is first modified to add a substituent, then undergoes a reaction to form the formyl group.

Wait, another idea: the starting ethynylcyclohexane could be converted into a carbonyl group, then that carbonyl could be used in a nucleophilic addition with a cyclohexyl group, perhaps via a Grignard reagent.

But that might not directly fit with the options provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then a cyclohexyl group is added via some nucleophilic attack or substitution.

But looking at the options, the steps involve NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which suggests alkylation of an acetylide.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves forming a cyclopropane ring, then opening it in a way to form the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde, then some kind of addition occurs.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is deprotonated and methylated to form a longer alkyne.

2. The alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane.

3. Ozonolysis is used to cleave a double bond, but that doesn't fit because step 2 would have a single bond.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation doesn't go to completion, leaving a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first hydrogenated to a double bond, then ozonolysis is used to cleave it. But that would require a dihydrogenation step, which I'm not sure is feasible.

Hmm. This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for the presence of specific reagents that correspond to known reactions.

The target has a hydroxyl group, so perhaps there's a dihydroxylation step, but none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps a epoxide ring-opening would introduce a hydroxyl group.

Wait, another approach: the target has a formyl group, which is a CHO group. The only way I can think of to form that from the starting alkyne is via hydration. So if the triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl group, that would give a ketone. Then, perhaps some oxidation would convert the ketone into a carboxylic acid, which could then be reduced to an aldehyde. But that's a bit involved.

Wait, but looking at option A, the last step is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the hydration of the triple bond. So perhaps the starting alkyne is being converted into a ketone, but I'm not sure how that leads to the target.

Wait, maybe the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is converted into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde via hydration. Then, perhaps some kind of substitution or addition occurs to add the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

But how? The target has both the aldehyde and the substituent on the same ring. So perhaps the substituent is added via some kind of Grignard reaction or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkyne with a methyl group, then hydrogenated to a diol, which upon oxidation forms the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the target's substituent comes from a cyclopropanation. For example, using the Simmons-Smith reagent (but that's not in the options). Alternatively, perhaps a cyclopropane is formed via a different method.

Wait, the option C steps include ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if there's a double bond in the molecule, ozonolysis would break it.

But in option C, after step 2, the molecule is an alkane. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation in step 2 is to a double bond, not a single bond. Maybe the catalyst is different.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is used in the formation of acetylides. Then, methyl chloride would provide a methyl group. So step 1 gives cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate would hydrogenate the triple bond. But wait, H2 with Pd would hydrogenate it to a single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is an alkane. Then, ozonolysis would do nothing. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is not being hydrogenated all the way. But I don't think so; H2 and Pd are usually for full hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps in option C, step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond. Or maybe it's a different catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is selective. I'm not sure.

Another idea: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. Maybe this comes from a Grignard reaction where a cyclohexyl group is added to a carbonyl.

If the starting material is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl magnesium bromide) could add to the carbonyl, forming a secondary alcohol after protonation. Then, perhaps oxidation would form the aldehyde.

But looking at the options, I don't see any Grignard reagents. So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve forming an epoxide. Ba(OH)2 is sometimes used in epoxide openings, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is causing some kind of elimination.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the functional groups in the target.

Target: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

This molecule has two rings: one cyclohexane with a formyl group (CHO), and another cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group.

So perhaps the starting material undergoes a series of reactions to add the substituent and form the aldehyde.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the triple bond into a carbonyl group (using HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O), giving a ketone.

2. Perform some kind of addition to the ketone, perhaps a Grignard reaction, to add a cyclohexyl group and form an alcohol.

3. Oxidize the secondary alcohol to a ketone? Or perhaps not.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxyl group, so perhaps the alcohol isn't oxidized further.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde via hydration.

2. Add a cyclohexyl group with a hydroxymethyl substituent.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is a good electrophile, and a cyclohexyl group is added via some kind of conjugate addition or nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a sodium enolate, which then reacts with a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not seeing the reagents for that in the options.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: let's consider which options include the correct reagents for forming the hydroxyl group and the formyl group.

The target has a hydroxyl group, which might be formed via ozonolysis followed by something else, or via epoxide opening, or via dihydroxylation.

Wait, looking at option C: step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, and step 4 is Ba(OH)2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis is used to form carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)2 is for elimination or forming epoxides.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide with NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenation → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → but wait, no double bond. So that doesn't work.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in option C is not a hydrogenation but a different reaction. Wait, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. No, that's definitely a hydrogenation catalyst.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible steps in each option.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li/LiNH3, then ozonolysis, then NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent, but I'm not sure how it reacts with NaNH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction condition. Birch uses NaNH2, NH3, and a solvent like ethanol. But here it's methanol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by something else.

Step 2: Li/LiNH3 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for deprotonation, perhaps forming a lithium acetylide, which could then undergo some cyclopropanation. But without a dihalide, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation to form a strong base, which could then abstract a proton elsewhere, leading to ring expansion or contraction.

Hmm.

Option D's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild acid.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide with NaNH2 and methanol → but I don't think methanol is a good methylating agent here.

Wait, perhaps step 1 forms the acetylide, which then undergoes some reaction with Li/LiNH3. Not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible correct option by elimination.

The target has a formyl group, which likely comes from the hydration of a triple bond. So the last step in the sequence should involve forming a carbonyl group. Looking at the options, the only options that have a step that could form a carbonyl via hydration are options A and C, which have H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O as step 4.

Wait, option A has step 4 as that. So perhaps option A is the correct one.

But earlier analysis suggests that step 1 and 2 would lead to a compound that doesn't directly form the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide with NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenation → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2: Maybe elimination to form a cyclohexene.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. If after step 2 we have cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, treating with Ba(OH)2 might cause elimination if there are adjacent H's. But cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 is a straight chain, so elimination would form a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond? No, wait:

Wait, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. If we eliminate H2O, perhaps we form a double bond. But without an OH group, elimination is unlikely. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could cause some kind of ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide formation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is in option C, where after step 3, ozonolysis breaks a double bond into two carbonyl groups, which then can be further reacted.

So, let's think:

Option C step 1: acetylide with methyl group → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but then step 3 is ozonolysis, which needs a double bond. So this doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps option C isn't the right one.

Another possibility: maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond instead of a single bond. But I don't think H2 and Pd would do that. They typically fully hydrogenate triple bonds.

Wait, perhaps in some cases, partial hydrogenation is possible. For example, using a Lindlar catalyst might hydrogenate a triple bond to a cis double bond, but that's not the case here. The catalyst in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is more likely for full hydrogenation.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should think about the possible products of each option's steps and see which one leads to the target.

Option A:

Step 1: form cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Hmm, maybe Ba(OH)2 in step 3 is for elimination. If cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 is treated with Ba(OH)2, perhaps it forms cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-OH? No, perhaps it's elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, elimination requires adjacent H's. So if the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, perhaps treatment with a strong base like Ba(OH)2 would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of water and forming a double bond. So from cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, elimination would give cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH=CH2? No, because the starting material after step 2 is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a straight chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe after step 1, it's cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, and step 2 reduces it to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But without a double bond, step 3 (Ba(OH)2) can't cause elimination. So maybe step 3 does something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide formation, but that requires an alkene.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in a Dieckmann cyclization, but that would require an ester.

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should consider the correct answer to be option C. Let me try to think about each step:

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → reduce triple bond to single bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so no reaction.

This doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Maybe after step 2, the compound is an alkene. But how? Unless step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond.

Wait, another thought: H2 and Pd could hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond, but I don't think that's the case. Typically, H2 and Pd would add two H's to each carbon of the triple bond, making a single bond.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → methylated to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. Partial hydrogenation to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction to a cis double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that doesn't reduce the triple bond, but I think that's unlikely.

Another possibility: Perhaps the correct option is option C, but the steps don't directly align with my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and the correct option is option C.

Wait, after ozonolysis, the molecule would break into two carbonyl groups. So if the starting material after step 2 is a di-substituted alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

But I'm not seeing how that would lead to the target.

Hmm. Another Idea: The target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl substituent with a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne via hydration, and the substituent comes from a Grignard reaction.

But I'm not seeing Grignard reagents in the options.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in option A is used to form a diol, which upon treatment with a base forms the substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Form the acetylide and methylate it.

2. Hydrogenate to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis can't do anything, so perhaps step 3 is not applicable.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to find which option leads to the formyl group and the substituent.

The target has a formyl group, which comes from an alkyne via hydration. So step 4 in option A is the hydration, which adds a carbonyl group. So perhaps the steps are:

1. Methylate the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate to an alkane.

3. Ba(OH)2 does something else.

4. Hydrate to form a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, where after ozonolysis, the molecule is cleaved to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not confident.

Another Idea: Let's consider the number of carbons. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH). After step 1 in option C, it becomes C6H11-C≡C-CH3 (four carbons). Step 2 hydrogenates it to C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (five carbons). Ozonolysis would require a double bond, which isn't present, so it can't cleave. So option C's steps don't work.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting carbons.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH (which has 7 carbons in total: 6 from the cyclohexane and 1 from the ethynyl). After step 1, it's C6H11-C≡C-CH3 (still 7 carbons). Step 2 hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond: C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 (still 7 carbons). So no double bond, ozonolysis does nothing.

Thus, option C's steps don't work.

Hmm. Another Idea: Perhaps the correct option is option C, but the steps are as follows:

Step 1: form the methylated acetylide.

Step 2: hydrogenate to a cis double bond (but I don't think H2/Pd does that).

Step 3: ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 does something else.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But honestly, I'm getting stuck, and I think it's time to make an educated guess.

The target has a formyl group, which likely comes from hydration of an alkyne. The only option that includes the hydration step (step 4) is option A. So perhaps option A is correct.

But earlier analysis suggested that step 2 would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, making the subsequent steps not form the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → reduces to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe Ba(OH)2 is used to form an epoxide, but without a double bond, that's not possible. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination to form a double bond. So cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2.

But without an H, elimination can't happen. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is causing a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Then step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of the triple bond. Wait, but after step 2, the triple bond is gone. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps after step 3, the compound has a triple bond again, which is then hydrated in step 4. But that doesn't fit with the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is forming an epoxide, which upon acid workup forms a diol, which then can be oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But without more information, I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option C. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Form the acetylide and methylate.

2. Hydrogenate to a double bond (but I don't think H2/Pd does that).

3. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls.

4. Then Ba(OH)2 does something.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time; I'll go with option C.


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely form the acetylide of ethynylcyclohexane and methylate it to give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **Step 2**: H₂/Pd reduces the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Step 3**: Ba(OH)₂, a strong base, might induce elimination or other transformations, but the exact outcome is unclear.
4. **Step 4**: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, and H₂O hydrate a carbonyl group, but after step 2, the triple bond is already reduced, making this step questionable.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride likely form an ethylated acetylide.
2. **Step 2**: Li/LiNH₃ is a strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation, but its role is ambiguous.
3. **Step 3**: O₃/(H₂O) cleaves double bonds, but the compound after step 2 does not have a double bond.
4. **Step 4**: NH₄OH is a mild acid, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride form the acetylide and methylate it to give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **Step 2**: H₂/Pd reduces the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Step 3**: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves double bonds, but the compound after step 2 is an alkane, so ozonolysis cannot proceed.
4. **Step 4**: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and methanol might deprotonate the alkyne, but methanol is not a strong methylating agent.
2. **Step 2**: Li/LiNH₃ is a strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation, but its role is ambiguous.
3. **Step 3**: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves double bonds, but the compound after step 2 does not have a double bond.
4. **Step 4**: NH₄OH is a mild acid, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule has a formyl group, which likely originates from the hydration of a triple bond. Among the options, only **Option A** includes a hydration step (step 4), which could form the carbonyl group. However, the sequence of steps in Option A does not clearly lead to the target molecule. Despite this ambiguity, **Option C** is the most plausible choice, as it involves steps that could potentially form the required functional groups, even though the exact mechanism is unclear.
