Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take it step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the state being a unit vector. Oh right, normalization is when the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients equals 1.

Wait, the coefficients here are (1+i) and (2-i). To find the normalization factor, I'll compute the squared magnitudes. The magnitude of 1+i is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2). So |1+i|^2 is (sqrt(2))^2=2. Similarly, for 2-i, the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5), so |2-i|^2 is 5. 

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. Wait, but wait, no, wait. The normalization is (a + b)^2 where a and b are the coefficients. So the total squared norm is |1+i|² + |2−i|². Let me calculate that. |1+i|=sqrt(1+1)=sqrt(2), so squared is 2. |2−i|=sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5), squared is 5. So 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

But wait, the question says |alpha> is proportional to that. So I think I don't have to worry about the constant yet; maybe I need it later when calculating probabilities.

Next part: the operator whose matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, this is a 2x2 matrix since |up> and |down> are spin states. So the matrix would look like:

[0   ħ/2
 ħ/2 0 ]

Because when i≠j, it's ħ/2. So the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

I need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator. Wait, but the eigenstates of this operator are not necessarily |up> and |down>, right? Because the operator isn't the Pauli z matrix, it's something else. So I think I need to find the eigenstates of this operator.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the matrix to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Because then, when I express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates, the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

So let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A.

The matrix A is:

[ 0      ħ/2
  ħ/2    0 ]

The eigenvalues λ are found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0.

Which gives:

| -λ      ħ/2       |
| ħ/2     -λ       |  = 0.

So determinant: (λ^2) - (ħ/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Each eigenvalue has its own eigenvector.

Let's find the eigenvectors.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) v = 0.

Matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    -ħ/2 ]

So the equations are:

- (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1). But we can normalize them.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

Matrix becomes:

[ ħ/2    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    ħ/2 ]

Equation: (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = -v1.

So eigenvectors are proportional to (1, -1).

Wait, but I should probably write them as (1,1) and (1,-1), then normalize.

So the first eigenvector (for λ= ħ/2) is (1,1)/sqrt(2), because the vector is (1,1), and the norm is sqrt(1+1)=sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Second eigenvector (λ= -ħ/2) is (1,-1)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when λ is positive, the equation is v1 = v2, so the vector is (1,1). When λ is negative, the equation is v1 = -v2, so vector is (1,-1).

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the signs. Let me think. For λ = ħ/2, the matrix is:

[ -ħ/2    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    -ħ/2 ]

So the equation for the first row is (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 +v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is (1,1), but wait, the direction is (1,1), so when I normalize, it's (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

For λ = -ħ/2, the matrix is:

[ ħ/2    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    ħ/2 ]

So equation from first row: (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 + v2=0 → v2 = -v1.

So eigenvectors are like (1,-1), normalized to (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but maybe I should represent this in terms of the original basis. So, any state can be expressed as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

Now, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, up to a normalization factor of 1/sqrt(7). So I'll write |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

I need to express this state as a linear combination of |+> and |->. Let me denote |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me write:

|alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

To find a and b, I can take the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Alternatively, I can write |up> and |down> in terms of |+> and |->.

From |+> and |->:

|up> = (|+> + |->) / sqrt(2),
|down> = (|+> - |->)/sqrt(2).

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i) (|+> + |->)/sqrt(2) + (2-i) (|+> - |->)/sqrt(2) ) / sqrt(7).

Simplify this expression.

Let me compute the coefficients for |+> and |->.

The coefficients for |+>:

(1+i)/sqrt(2) + (2-i)/sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / sqrt(2) → (3) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, the coefficients for |->:

(1+i)/sqrt(2) - (2-i)/sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] / sqrt(2) → ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, expanding:

(1+i) (|+> + |->)/sqrt(2) → (1+i)|+> / sqrt(2) + (1+i)|-> / sqrt(2).

Similarly, (2-i) (|+> - |->)/sqrt(2) → (2-i)|+> / sqrt(2) - (2-i)|-> / sqrt(2).

So combining terms:

|+> [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / sqrt(2) + |-> [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] / sqrt(2).

Compute numerator for |+>:

(1+i + 2 -i ) = 3. So |+> coefficient is 3 / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)).

Numerator for |->: (1+i -2 +i )= (-1 + 2i). So |-> coefficient is (-1 + 2i)/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, but |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), so when we express in terms of |+> and |->, each term is multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), so the coefficients a and b would be:

a = [ (1+i) + (2-i) ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) = (3) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)).

b = [ (1+i) - (2−i) ) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7) ) = ( (1 +i -2 +i ) ) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) → (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2)sqrt(7)).

Wait, perhaps I should write this correctly. Let me re-calculate the coefficients.

Wait, the entire |alpha> expression after substitution is [ (1+i)(|+> + |->) + (2-i)(|+> - |->) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7))).

Expanding the numerator:

(1+i)|+> + (1+i)|-> + (2-i)|+> - (2-i)|->.

Grouping the |+> terms and |-> terms:

[ (1+i) + (2-i) ] |+> + [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] |->.

Compute each:

(1+i)+(2-i) = 3 → so (3)|+>.

(1+i) - (2-i) = (1-2) + (i + i) = (-1) + 2i → (-1 + 2i)|->.

So the expression becomes [ 3 |+> + (-1 + 2i)|-> ] / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

So the coefficients a and b are:

a = 3 / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)).

b = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)).

Wait, but the state |alpha> is a linear combination of |+> and |->, so |alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

Therefore, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is |a|^2, and for eigenvalue -ħ/2 is |b|^2.

So let's compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = 3 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) → |a|^2 = (9) / (2 *7) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64, which is one of the options.

Compute |b|^2:

b = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)).

|b|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (2 *7) → (1 +4)/14 → 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64 and 5/14≈0.36. So the first part of the answer should be 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me check the calculations. Because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probabilities directly without changing the basis, but I think the approach is correct.

Wait, but wait another thought: The operator in question is A, whose matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Its eigenstates are the ones I found: |+> and |->. So the probabilities are indeed |a|^2 and |b|^2.

So for the measurement probabilities: 9/14 ≈ 0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571. So the options that have 0.64 and 0.36 are option A (0.64, 0.36) and D (0.61, 0.29).

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is around 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded.

So the first two probabilities would be 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A.

Now, the average value. The average value of an operator is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, once the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of A, the expectation value is sum ( |c_i|^2 * lambda_i ), where lambda_i are the eigenvalues and |c_i|^2 the probabilities.

So, the average value is (|a|^2 * ħ/2) + (|b|^2 * (-ħ/2)).

Substituting the values:

(9/14)*(ħ/2) + (5/14)*(-ħ/2).

= [ (9/14 -5/14) ) * ħ/2 ]

= (4/14) * (ħ/2)

= (2/7) * (ħ/2) )

Wait, wait, 4/14 is 2/7. So that's (2/7)*(ħ/2) ) = (2 * ħ) / (7 * 2) ) → ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, average hbar/7 → matches.

But let's check the other options. Option D has 0.61, 0.29, which would suggest probabilities summing to 0.9, which is not possible. Wait, no, 0.61 + 0.29 is 0.9, but they should sum to 1. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, 9/14 is around 0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded. 5/14 is about 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. 0.64 + 0.36 = 1, so that's correct.

So the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is option A.

Wait, but looking back, the possible options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → seems correct.

But wait, let me think again about the average value. Because, the operator's expectation value is calculated as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it using the matrix representation.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So, |alpha> = [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

The operator A is the 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

So, to compute <A>, we can compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

So, let me compute this.

First, the vector |alpha> is [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Then, A |alpha> is:

First component: 0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)*(2-i) → (ħ/2)(2-i) = ħ(1 - i/2 )

Second component: (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2-i) → (ħ/2)(1+i) = (ħ/2)(1 +i )

So, A |alpha> = [ ħ(1 - i/2 ), (ħ/2)(1+i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A |alpha>.

So, [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ ħ(1 - i/2 ), (ħ/2)(1+i) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, because |alpha> is [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T / sqrt(7), so the conjugate transpose is [ (1-i), (2+i) ] / sqrt(7).

So, the product is:

[ (1-i) ( ħ (1 - i/2 )) + (2+i) * (ħ/2 (1 + i )) ) ] / (7).

Compute each term:

First term: (1-i) * ħ (1 - i/2 )

Let me compute (1 - i) (1 - i/2).

= 1*(1) + 1*(-i/2) ) + (-i)(1) + (-i)(-i/2)

= 1 - i/2 - i + (i^2)/2

= 1 - (i/2 + 2i/2) + (-1/2)

= 1 - (3i/2) - 1/2

= (1 - 1/2) - (3i/2)

= 1/2 - (3i/2)

So first term is ħ*(1/2 - 3i/2 )

Second term: (2 + i) * (ħ/2 (1 +i )) 

Factor out ħ/2:

= (2 + i) (1 + i ) * (ħ/2 )

Compute (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2i + i*1 + i^2 → 2 + 3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So second term is (1+3i) * (ħ/2 )

Now, summing the two terms:

First term: ħ (1/2 - 3i/2 ) → ħ/2 - (3i ħ)/2

Second term: (1+3i ) ħ/2 → ħ/2 + (3i ħ)/2.

Adding together:

( ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) + ( (-3i ħ/2) + (3i ħ/2) )

= ħ + 0 = ħ.

So the numerator is ħ, and the denominator is 7.

So <A> = ħ/7.

Which matches what I found earlier.

So the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says average is hbar/7. So the correct answer is option A.

But wait, looking again at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → which matches our findings.

But wait, looking back at the probabilities: 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places, and 5/14 is about 0.3571, which is 0.36. So the first two probabilities are correct, and the average is correct.

So the correct option is A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator with matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and 0 otherwise, as well as the average value of the operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is |α⟩ ∝ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- \( |1+i|^2 = 2 \),
- \( |2-i|^2 = 5 \).

The total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \). The normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)|\text{up}⟩ + (2-i)|\text{down}⟩}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 2: Diagonalize the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), yielding \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:
- For \( \lambda = \frac{\hbar}{2} \): \( |+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\text{up}⟩ + |\text{down}⟩) \),
- For \( \lambda = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \): \( |−⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\text{up}⟩ - |\text{down}⟩) \).

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in the eigenbasis of \( A \)
Substitute \( |\text{up}⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+⟩ + |−⟩) \) and \( |\text{down}⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+⟩ - |−⟩) \) into |α⟩:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+⟩ + |−⟩) + (2-i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+⟩ - |−⟩)}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Simplify to find the coefficients of \( |+⟩ \) and \( |−⟩ \):
- Coefficient of \( |+⟩ \): \( a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} \),
- Coefficient of \( |−⟩ \): \( b = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} \).

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \):
- \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64 \),
- \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36 \).

### Step 4: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of the operator is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
