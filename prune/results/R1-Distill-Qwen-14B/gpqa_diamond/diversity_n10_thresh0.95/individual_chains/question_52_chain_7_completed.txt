Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. I remember that stars with spots can affect their overall temperature and how we observe elements in their spectrum.

The star's parameters are given as 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, I think starspots are actually cooler than the surrounding photosphere, right? Because they're regions with lower temperature. So when a star has spots, the average temperature would go down. But in this case, the overall Teff is given as 5500 K, so that makes sense.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is R = N1/N2, where N1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and N2 in level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So R is lower with spots. We need to find the factor by which R changes, so R_without_spots divided by R_with_spots.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Here, g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2 and E1 are their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The ratio they're considering is N1/N2. So R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Because flipping N2/N1 gives N1/N2. So if E2 is higher than E1, the exponent is positive. But since the temperature changes, this ratio would change.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I think that's in the ultraviolet range, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key here is to find the ratio of R for two different temperatures.

Wait, but wait. The star's temperature is not uniform because part of its surface is covered with spots. Oh, but the problem says the photosphere is in LTE. So the effective temperature given (5500 K when spots are present) is the average. So when considering the photosphere as a whole, the effective temperature is lower when spots are present. But does that mean the temperature of the photospheric material is lower? Hmm, perhaps we're to model the whole photosphere as having a lower effective temperature, so it's the same as the star being at a lower Teff.

Wait, but when the star has spots, 40% of the surface is cooler. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the effective temperature here is the average, considering the spots.

Wait, but wait. The star's actual photospheric temperature varies across the surface. But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE. So each region (spot and non-spot) is in LTE, but the overall effective temperature is a mixture. But the problem says when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the effective temperature is 5500 K when there are spots, and 6000 K when there are none. So for each case, we can calculate the ratio R.

So the ratio R is N1/N2. When the star has spots, R decreases. So when the star is cooler (5500 K), R is smaller than when it's hotter (6000 K). Therefore, the ratio when no spots (R1) is higher than when spots are present (R2). We need to find R1/R2.

So let me write down the expressions.

R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

But wait, E2 and E1 are the energies of the two levels. The difference in energy can be determined from the wavelength of the transition. The transition corresponds to a photon with wavelength λ = 1448 Å. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

Wait, but the energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So, we can compute ΔE in terms of temperature, but perhaps we can find the ratio of the exponentials for the two temperatures.

Let me denote T1 as 6000 K, T2 as 5500 K.

Then, the ratio R1/R2 is [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ] 

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out. So R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Hmm, that's the expression.

I can compute ΔE in terms of wavelength. Let me compute ΔE in terms of Kelvin.

Wait, the energy E is hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ in meters. But we can relate this to temperature via the relation E = k T * something. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute E/(k) in terms of T, but maybe I should compute the ratio.

Wait, let me compute the value of (ΔE)/(k) for the given wavelength.

Let me calculate that.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 2.99792458e8 m/s
k = 1.380649e-23 J/K
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So ΔE = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 * 2.998e8) / (1448e-10)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 ≈ 1.986e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE ≈ (1.986e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.37e-18 J.

Now, E/(k) = (1.37e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.37e-18)/(1.38e-23) ≈ 9.93e4 K.

Wait, let me compute that again.

1.37e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.37 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.993 * 1e5 ≈ 99300 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99300 K.

So now, let's compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) where T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.

1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667
1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182

So 0.00018182 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515 ≈ 1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (99300) * (1.515e-5) = 99300 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute that:

99300 * 1.515e-5 = (99300) * (0.00001515) = (99300 * 0.00001515) 

Computing 99300 * 1.515e-5:

Well, 99300 * 1.515e-5 = (99300 / 1e5) ) * 1.515 * 1e5 * 1e-5 )

Wait, 99300 is 9.93e4, so 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.93 * 1.515 * 1e-1 

= approximately 15.04 * 0.1 = 1.504.

So the exponent is about 1.504.

So the ratio R1/R2 is exp(1.504) ≈ e^1.504.

What's e^1.5? e is approximately 2.718, so e^1.5 is around 4.48. Let me check e^1.504.

Using a calculator:

e^1 = 2.71828
e^0.5 = 1.64872
e^1.5 = e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.64872 ≈ 4.4817.

Wait, but 1.504 is a bit higher than 1.5. Let's compute e^0.004. e^0.004 ≈ 1 + 0.004 + (0.004)^2/2 ≈ 1.004008.

So e^1.504 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.004 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.004008 ≈ ~4.50.

So the ratio R1/R2 is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but the options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

So the correct answer would be C) ~4.5.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

Wait, let me recompute ΔE/(k) more accurately.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 2.99792458e8 m/s
λ = 1448e-10 m.

So hc = 6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8 = let's compute this:

6.62607e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 (approx)
But more accurately, 2.99792e8 is approximately 2.99792 * 1e8 = 2.99792e8.

So 6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8 = ?

Multiply 6.62607 * 2.99792 ≈ 19.86.

So 6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8 = 19.86e-26 = 1.986e-25 J·m.

So hc = 1.986e-25 J·m.

Then hc/λ = 1.986e-25 / (1448e-10 m) = 1.986e-25 / 1.448e-7.

Dividing these: 1.986 / 1.448 ≈ 1.3715.

Exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-7 = 1e-18.

So ΔE = 1.3715e-18 J.

Now, ΔE/(k) = (1.3715e-18 J) / (1.380649e-23 J/K) = (1.3715e-18) / (1.380649e-23) ≈ (1.3715/1.380649) * 1e5.

1.3715 / 1.380649 ≈ approximately 0.9939.

So 0.9939e5 ≈ 99390 K.

So about 99390 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 99390 K.

Now, (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000) - (1/5500) = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) ) 

Wait, no, wait, 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) )? Wait, no, because 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000*5500) )? No, wait, when you have 1/a -1/b = (b - a)/ (a b).

So (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(6000 *5500) )

Wait, wait no, that would give a negative number, but earlier I had 1/5500 > 1/6000, so 1/5500 - 1/6000 is positive. Oh wait, in the earlier calculation, the exponent was (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2), but in the problem, R is higher at higher T, so when T increases, the exponent (ΔE/(k T)) increases, so R is larger when T is higher.

But in calculating the ratio R1/R2, where T1 is higher (6000 K) and T2 is lower (5500 K), the exponent becomes (ΔE/k) [1/T1 - 1/T2 ].

Wait, let me correct the calculation.

Wait, R1 is N1/N2 at T1=6000 K, R2 is N1/N2 at T2=5500 K.

So R1 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

= exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, but ΔE is E2-E1, so positive.

So when T increases, the exponent increases, so R increases.

So R1 (6000 K) is larger than R2 (5500 K).

Which matches the problem statement that the ratio decreases when there are spots (so R2 is smaller than R1).

So the ratio R1/R2 is exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is exp( (99390 K) * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) ) )

Now, compute (1/6000) - (1/5500):

Let me compute 1/6000 = 0.000166667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818.

So 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151.

So (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = 99390 * (-0.000015151) ≈ let's compute that.

Multiply 99390 by 0.000015151.

99390 * 0.000015151 ≈ 99390 * 1.5151e-5.

Hmm, 1e5 is 100000.

So (approx) 99390 * 1.5151e-5 = (99390 / 1e5) ) * 1.5151.

99390 / 1e5 = 0.9939.

0.9939 * 1.5151 ≈ approx 1.504.

So the exponent is (99390) * (-0.000015151) ≈ -1.504.

Wait, wait, no. Because 99390 * (-0.000015151) is negative.

So the exponent is (99390) * (-0.000015151) ≈ -1.504. So exp(-1.504) ≈ 1 / exp(1.504).

Earlier, I computed exp(1.504) ≈ 4.5, so 1/4.5 ≈ 0.222.

Wait, but that would make R1/R2 = exp( -1.504 ) ≈ 0.222. But that would mean R1 is smaller than R2 by a factor of ~4.5. But the problem says that R decreases when the star has spots. So R2 < R1.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign.

Let me recalculate (1/T1 - 1/T2):

T1 = 6000 K, T2=5500 K.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 ≈ -0.000015151.

So (ΔE/k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 99390 * (-0.000015151) = -1.504.

So the exponent is -1.504, so exp(-1.504) ≈ 0.222.

So R1/R2 = 0.222, which implies R1 is about 0.222 times R2. That would mean R decreases when the star has spots, which aligns with the problem statement.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So R1 is the ratio without spots, R2 is with spots. So the factor is R1/R2 ≈ 0.222. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. Because the options are positive factors, and option C is 4.5.

Wait, perhaps I made a sign mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the ratio R is N1/N2. The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R2 < R1.

So R1/R2 is the factor by which the ratio increases when going from spots to no spots.

Wait, but in the calculation, R1/R2 is 0.222, which would imply R1 is smaller than R2. That's conflicting with the problem statement.

Ah, wait, no. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, let's re-derive the ratio.

The ratio is R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, E2 is higher than E1 because the transition is from E1 to E2, emitting a photon of wavelength 1448 Å. So E2 > E1.

So when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making exp(positive) larger. So R increases when T increases.

So when the star is hotter (6000 K), R is higher. When it's cooler (5500 K), R is lower. So R1 (6000 K) is larger than R2 (5500 K), meaning R1/R2 is > 1.

But in my earlier calculation, I found that R1/R2 is exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ), which is exp( (99390) ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) )) )

Which is exp( 99390 * (-0.000015151) ) = exp( -1.504 ) ≈ 0.222.

Which would mean R1 is 0.222 times R2, but that would imply R1 < R2, which is the opposite of what we expect.

I must have made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the ratio R is N1/N2.

The Boltzmann equation is N2 = N1 (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So as T increases, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases because (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive and larger when T is smaller.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think of (E2-E1)/(k T) when T increases. For example, if T doubles, then (E2-E1)/(k T) halves. So as T increases, the exponent becomes smaller. So exp(small) is smaller than exp(large).

Wait, no. Let's plug in some numbers.

At T = 6000 K:

Exponent term: (E2-E1)/(k T) = 99390 / 6000 ≈ 16.565.

exp(16.565) is a huge number.

Wait, no, wait, but wait, I think I got the units wrong. Oh no! Because E is in Joules, and k is in J/K. So their ratio is in K.

Wait, no. Let me compute ΔE/(k) in K.

Earlier, I found ΔE/(k) ≈ 99390 K.

So at T1 = 6000 K, (ΔE)/(k T1) = (99390) / 6000 ≈ 16.565.

Similarly, at T2 = 5500 K, (ΔE)/(k T2) ≈ 99390 / 5500 ≈ 18.0709.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, let's compute 99390 / 6000.

99390 divided by 6000 is 99390 /6e3 = 9939 /600 = 16.565.

Similarly, 99390 /5500 = 99390 /5.5e3 = 9939 /550 ≈ 18.07.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T) = 99390 K / T.

So at higher T, this value is smaller.

Wait, but then in the exponent of the Boltzmann factor, it's (E2-E1)/(k T) = (ΔE)/(k) * (1/T).

So when T increases, the exponent (ΔE/(k T)) decreases. So the Boltzmann factor is exp( (ΔE)/(k T) ). So when T increases, the exponent is smaller, so the exp becomes smaller.

Wait, but wait, if T increases, (ΔE/(k T)) decreases, so the exponent is smaller, and exp(small) is smaller than exp(bigger). So for higher T, the exp term is smaller, meaning N1/N2 is smaller. Wait, that's conflicting with earlier reasoning.

Wait, let me think: when T increases, the thermal energy is higher. So in higher T, the population in higher energy levels (like N2) should be higher. So N2/N1 should be higher, meaning N1/N2 (R) is lower. So when T increases, R decreases.

Wait, but that's opposite to what I thought earlier. Hmm, perhaps I had it backward.

Wait, let me correct this: the Boltzmann equation says N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(kT) becomes less negative (since the denominator is bigger, so the whole term is smaller. For example, at T=6000, it's -16.565, but at T=5500, it's -18.0709. So at higher T, the exponent is less negative, so exp of it is higher. So N2/N1 is higher, meaning N1/N2 is lower.

So, when T increases, R = N1/N2 decreases.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought before. So when the star has no spots (T=6000), R is lower than when it has spots (T=5500). But the problem states that when the star has spots, R decreases. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present (lower T), R is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T leads to lower R. Because when T is higher, more atoms are in the higher energy level, so N2 is higher, making N1/N2 lower.

Wait, so when the star is hotter (no spots), R is lower. When it's cooler (has spots), R is higher. But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this is conflicting.

Wait, that suggests I might have made a mistake in the setup. Let me read the problem again.

Problem states:

When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff drops to 5500 K.

When examining the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels (level 1 and level 2), the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the ratio R = N1/N2 decreases. So R is lower when there are spots.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T leads to lower R. So when T is higher (no spots), R is lower; when T is lower (spots), R is higher. But the problem states that when spots are present, R decreases. So this is a contradiction.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the initial assumption about the energy levels is wrong. Maybe the way I set up the levels is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps E1 is higher than E2. No, because the transition is from E1 to E2, emitting a photon of wavelength 1448 Å. So E2 must be higher than E1. So when an atom is in E2, it can emit a photon to go to E1.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, when an atom is in a higher energy level, it can emit a photon to go to a lower energy level. So the transition from E2 to E1 emits a photon of energy hc/λ.

So the energy E2 is higher than E1.

So (E2 - E1) = hc/λ = positive.

So (E2 - E1)/(k T) is positive.

So in the Boltzmann equation, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-x) increases as x decreases. So N2/N1 increases, meaning N1/N2 decreases.

So when T is higher, R = N1/N2 is lower.

But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), R decreases. Which would imply that R is lower with spots, so when T is lower, R is lower.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger. So the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) is more negative, so exp is smaller, so N2/N1 is smaller, so N1/N2 is higher.

Wait, that's the opposite of what the problem says. So this suggests that the assumption is incorrect. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got E2 and E1 mixed up. Let me reconsider.

Suppose that E1 is higher than E2. Then, (E2 - E1) is negative.

Then, (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative.

So, in the Boltzmann equation, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

= (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

If E1 > E2, then (E1-E2) is positive, so exponent is positive.

As T increases, (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes smaller, so exp becomes smaller, so N2/N1 decreases. Thus, N1/N2 increases.

So when T increases, R = N1/N2 increases. So when the star has no spots (higher T), R is higher. When the star has spots (lower T), R is lower.

Which matches the problem statement: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.

Ah! So perhaps I had the energy levels reversed earlier. So E1 is higher than E2.

Wait, but the transition is from E1 to E2, emitting a photon. That would imply E1 > E2.

Wait, no. Wait, when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon. So if the atom is in E1 (higher) and transitions to E2 (lower), it emits a photon of wavelength 1448 Å.

In that case, E1 > E2, so E1 - E2 = hc/λ.

So in the Boltzmann equation, (E2 - E1) = -(E1 - E2) = -hc/λ.

So the ratio R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, wait, that's getting confusing. Let me write it clearly.

E2 is lower than E1.

Thus, E2 = E1 - (hc/λ)

So E2 - E1 = -(hc/λ) = -ΔE.

So (E2 - E1)/(k T) = -ΔE/(k T).

So R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, as T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative. So exp(-x) increases as x decreases.

So, for higher T, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases, leading to higher R = N1/N2.

Which aligns with the problem statement: when the star is hotter (no spots), R is higher. When cooler (spots), R is lower.

So, the earlier mistake was assuming E2 > E1, leading to a conflicting conclusion. So the correct setup is E1 > E2, so the transition is from E1 to E2.

So, with that, let's recompute.

The correct setup is E1 > E2, so (E2 - E1) = -ΔE, where ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/λ.

So R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Thus, when T increases, the exponent -ΔE/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp becomes larger, so R increases.

So, with that, let me recompute the ratio R1/R2.

R1 is for T1=6000 K, R2 for T2=5500 K.

R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) )

= exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) )

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 -1/T1) )

So let's compute (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

ΔE/k is 99390 K.

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500 * 6000) )

Wait, 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182, 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667. So 0.00018182 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515.

So (ΔE/k) (1/T2 -1/T1) = 99390 K * 0.00001515 ≈ let's compute.

99390 * 0.00001515 = 99390 * 1.515e-5 ≈ same as 99390 * 1.515e-5.

As before, 99390 * 1.515e-5 = 99390 * 0.00001515 ≈ 1.504.

So the exponent becomes 1.504.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.504) ≈ 4.50.

So the factor is about 4.5, which matches option C.

Ah, so the correct answer is C) ~4.5.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, \( R = \frac{N_1}{N_2} \), changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. The star's effective temperature (\( T_{\text{eff}} \)) is 6000 K without spots and decreases to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by cooler spots. The energy difference between the two levels corresponds to a transition wavelength of 1448 Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels and Boltzmann Equation**:  
   The ratio \( R = \frac{N_1}{N_2} \) is governed by the Boltzmann equation:
   \[
   R = \frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
   \]
   where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E = E_1 - E_2 \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), the energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
   \]
   where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light.

2. **Energy Difference in Terms of Temperature**:  
   Using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), the energy difference is calculated as:
   \[
   \Delta E \approx 1.37 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Dividing by \( k \), the dimensionless ratio \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \) is:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 99390 \, \text{K}.
   \]

3. **Ratio of Ratios**:  
   The ratio \( R_1/R_2 \) (where \( R_1 \) is at \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( R_2 \) is at \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)) is given by:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substituting \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 99390 \, \text{K} \), \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00001515.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(99390 \times 0.00001515\right) = \exp(1.504).
   \]

4. **Exponential Calculation**:  
   Using \( \exp(1.504) \approx 4.5 \), the ratio \( R_1/R_2 \) is approximately 4.5.

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio \( R \) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
