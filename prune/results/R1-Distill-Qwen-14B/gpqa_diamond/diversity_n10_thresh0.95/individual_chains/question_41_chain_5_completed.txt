Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They also mention that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

The options are A to D, each with some expressions involving n and v. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I think this might involve the relativistic addition of velocities or something like that.

Wait, wait. Let's break it down. So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

I remember that in classical mechanics, you just add velocities, but since this involves light, which moves at a constant speed in all inertial frames (as per Einstein's postulate), things are different. So maybe I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The velocity addition formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²), where u' is the velocity of the object in the moving frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the lab. Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the frames here.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v. Inside the glass, the light's speed would be c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n = c/v_glass, so v_glass = c/n. Wait, but no—wait, the speed of light in the medium is v = c/n. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v = c/n towards the observer, since the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, no—wait, the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n, because the glass is stationary in its own frame, and the light is moving at that speed.

But in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, I need to calculate the speed of the light as observed by someone in the lab. So the light's speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n, but the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So I think I need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula to find u_lab.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is: u_lab = (u_glass + v) / (1 + (u_glass * v)/c² )

So u_glass is the speed of the light in the glass's frame. But wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, so the direction of v is towards the observer. Wait, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the lab is moving at -v relative to the glass. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the lab sees the glass moving at v (towards the observer, so if the observer is on the right, the glass is moving to the right at speed v). The light is moving to the right through the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n to the right. So in the lab frame, what's the speed?

So applying the velocity addition formula: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

But wait, the formula depends on the frame of reference. Let me get this right. Suppose in the S' frame (glass's frame), the light's velocity is u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. The S frame (lab) is moving at velocity v relative to S' (so if the glass is moving at v in S, then S' is moving at -v in S). Wait, no, the S' frame (glass) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab (S). So to transform from S' to S, we use the standard velocity addition formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

Wait, no: the standard formula is when you have an object moving at u' in S', and S' is moving at v relative to S. Then the velocity u in S is given by u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²) )

So in this case, the light's speed in S' (glass frame) is u' = c/n. The glass is moving at v in the lab frame (S). So substituting, u = (c/n + v) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v (c/n) ) / c² = 1 + (v)/(n c) )

So u = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( (n c + v )/(n c) ) )

Wait, let me compute that again. Let's compute denominator and numerator step by step.

Numerator: (c/n + v) = (c + n v)/n.

Denominator: 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v c) / (n c² ) ) = 1 + v/(n c).

So denominator is [n c + v ]/(n c) ) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute denominator correctly.

Denominator is 1 + ( (u' v) ) / c². u' is c/n, so u' v = (c/n) v. So (u' v)/c² = (c v)/(n c² ) ) = v/(n c).

So denominator is 1 + v/(n c) = [n c + v ]/(n c), because 1 = n c/(n c), so 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So now, the u (lab frame) is [ (c + n v)/n ] divided by [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ].

So that's (c + n v)/n * (n c) / (n c + v) )

The n in the denominator cancels with the n in the numerator, so you get (c + n v) * c / (n c + v) )

Which simplifies to c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but wait, let me check the units—no, that's correct. So u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options are A to D, which have terms like 1 +n v over n +v, etc. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the speed of light in the lab frame. Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light should always be c, regardless of the frame. Wait, but that's only when light is moving in a vacuum. Wait, wait, no—wait, in a medium, the speed of light is different, but in any inertial frame, the speed of light in a vacuum is c. But here, the light is moving through glass, which is a medium, so its speed would be lower, but according to the medium's frame. Then, when the medium is moving, the lab frame would see it differently.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the speed of the light in the glass as observed in the lab. The glass is moving at velocity v. So the light's speed in the glass is c/n. But from the lab's perspective, what is its speed?

Wait, maybe I can approach this with just relative velocity, not worrying about relativity, but that's probably incorrect because v might not be negligible compared to c. So I should use the relativistic approach.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the velocity addition. Let me go back.

The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c^2))

Here, u' is the speed of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. So u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n)*v ) / c^2 )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v * c) / (n c^2 ) ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So u = ( (c + n v)/n ) / (1 + v/(n c) )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out c from denominator. Let me write denominator as (n c + v )/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n cancels out, so:

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but I'm getting an expression that doesn't seem to match any of the options. Let me calculate it again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expression. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the glass is moving toward the observer. So the velocity v is in the same direction as the light. So when the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement, the observed speed in the lab frame would be (c/n + v) / (1 + ( c v )/(n c²) ) )

Wait, that's the same as before. Simplifying, denominator is 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = (c/n + v) / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ) ]

Let me multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate the fractions:

Numerator: c^2 + n^2 v

Denominator: n c + v

So u = (c^2 + n^2 v) / (n c + v )

But wait, that doesn't match any of the options either. The options have (1 +n v) over (n + v), etc. Hmm.

Wait a second, maybe I should think of the speed of light in the lab frame. Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in any inertial frame should be c, but that's when the light is in a vacuum. Here, the light is in a moving medium (the glass) which has an index of refraction. So perhaps the speed is different.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the speed of the light as observed from the lab, considering that the glass is moving towards the observer. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be c/n plus v, but that's a classical approach, which is only correct at low velocities. But since the problem doesn't specify that v is small, I think the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again: the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n towards the observer (since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving through it in the same direction). So the observer in the lab sees the glass moving towards them at v. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be u = (c/n + v)/(1 + (c v)/(n c^2) )

Wait, that denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c ). So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ (c + n v) c ] / (n c + v )

Hmm. But the options don't have this. Let me see the options again.

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Option B: 1

Option C: (1 +n v)/(n -v )

Option D: (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, perhaps I did a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute u again.

So, u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v / c² )

u' is c/n.

So,

u = (c/n + v) / [1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c^2 ]

Simplify denominator: 1 + (c v)/(n c² ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( (n c + v)/(n c) )

Which becomes ( (c + n v)/n ) * (n c)/(n c + v )

Simplify, the n cancels:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

So,

u = [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator:

= [c (c + n v)] / [c (n) + v )

Hmm. Let's factor c from denominator:

= [c (c +n v)] / [c (n) + v ) ]

Wait, can I factor something else? Let me see:

Numerator: c^2 + c n v

Denominator: n c + v

Wait, that's the same as (c^2 + c n v ) / (n c + v )

Hmm. Let me factor c from numerator and denominator:

= c (c + n v ) / (c (n) + v )

Wait, I don't see an obvious simplification. Let me compute it for specific values to see which option it matches.

Wait, for example, let me take n=1 and v=0.

In that case, the speed should be c/n =1. Let's plug into my expression:

u = c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

n=1, v=0: u = c (c +0)/(c +0 ) = c^2 /c = c. Wait, but when n=1, the speed should be c/1 = c, which matches. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, if the glass isn't moving (v=0), the speed of light in the lab frame should be c/n, right? But according to this, when v=0, u = c * (c +0 ) / (c *1 + 0 ) = c^2 / c = c. But that's not correct because in the glass at rest, the light's speed is c/n=1 in this case.

Wait, that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, when v=0, the glass is at rest in the lab. So the light's speed should be c/n. But according to my formula, when v=0 and n=1, it gives u= c, which is correct because n=1 implies vacuum (since n=c/v_glass, so v_glass=c), but in this scenario, the glass is moving towards the observer at v=0, so no, wait, if v=0, the glass is stationary in the lab. So if n=1, the light's speed is c/1 = c, which is correct.

Wait, but if n=2, v=0, then u should be c/2. Let's plug into my formula:

u= [ c (c + 2*0 ) ] / (2 c +0 ) = c^2/(2 c )= c/2. Which is correct.

So the formula seems to work for v=0.

What about when v is non-zero. Let me try n=1, v=0.5 c.

Then, u= [ c (c + 1 * 0.5 c ) ] / (1 c + 0.5 c ) = [ c (1.5 c) ] / (1.5 c ) = (1.5 c² ) / 1.5 c ) = c. So u= c. Which is correct, because in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c.

Hmm. So when the medium is a vacuum (n=1), regardless of velocity, the observed speed is c.

But when n is not 1, the speed would be different.

Wait, but let's see the options. Suppose n=2 and v=1 c. Then, according to my formula,

u= c (c + 2*1 c ) / (2 c +1 c ) = c (3 c )/(3 c ) = c²/c= c. Which can't be right because for n=2, the light's speed in the medium is c/2. But when the medium is moving, according to relativity, the speed as observed should still be less than c, right? Because in the lab frame, in a medium moving at v, the speed of light should not exceed c.

Wait, but according to my formula, when v approaches c, what happens?

Let me see: let's say n=2, v=0.8 c.

u= [c (c + 2 *0.8 c ) ] / (2 c + 0.8 c ) = [c (1.6 c) ] / (2.8 c ) = (1.6 c² ) / 2.8 c = 1.6 c /2.8 ≈ 0.571 c.

That's less than c. So that makes sense.

But looking back at the options, none of them have the form we're getting here. So perhaps I should check if the problem is asking about the speed of the light as observed, which might be different from what I thought.

Wait, the question is: "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory?"

Wait, speed of light in glass—so perhaps the question is not about the velocity of the light in the lab frame, but about the speed of the light inside the glass as if it were at rest, which is c/n. But that can't be, because the glass is moving.

Alternatively, maybe the question is intended to be approached using the relativistic Doppler effect, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: suppose the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. The speed of light in the glass (as measured in the glass's frame) is c/n. So to find the speed in the lab frame, we use the relativistic addition formula.

So,

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c:

Numerator: c(c +n v )

Denominator: n c * [1] + v *1 = n c + v.

So,

u = [c(c +n v ) ] / (n c +v )

Which is the same as before. So this suggests that the speed of light as observed in the lab is [ c (c +n v) ] / (n c + v )

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the velocity addition but about the speed as seen from the lab, taking into account the movement of the glass. Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question where the speed of light is always c in any frame, but that's only in a vacuum. Wait, but in this case, the light is in glass, which is a medium, so the speed can be different.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the glass's rest frame, but from the lab's frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v, the speed would be different. So I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the options don't have the same form as what I'm deriving. Let's check the options again.

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Hmm. Let me see what happens if I set c=1, because in the problem statement c=1.

In that case, my expression becomes [ (1 +n v ) ] / (n +v )

Which is option A.

Ah, wait! Because when I set c=1, numerator becomes c (c +n v ) = 1*(1 +n v ) = 1 +n v.

Denominator becomes n c +v = n *1 +v = n +v.

So, when c=1, the expression is (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is option A.

So that's the correct answer. So the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but when I plug in n=1, v=0, I get (1+1*0)/(1+0 )=1, which is correct.

When n=2, v=0, (1+0)/(2+0 )=0.5, which is c/n=0.5 in this case.

When n=1, v=0.5, (1+1*0.5)/(1+0.5 )= 1.5/1.5=1, which is correct for vacuum.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at velocity \(v\) relative to the lab, and the light propagates through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \(c/n\), where \(n\) is the refractive index of the glass.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \(u'\) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, which is \(c/n\),
- \(v\) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab,
- \(c\) is the speed of light in a vacuum, and \(c = 1\) in this problem.

Substituting \(u' = c/n\) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \(n c\) to simplify:

\[
u = \frac{c + n v}{n c + v}
\]

Since \(c = 1\), this simplifies further to:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Now, compare this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \(\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}\) — This matches the derived expression.
- **Option B**: \(1\) — Incorrect, as it does not account for the refractive index or the velocity \(v\).
- **Option C**: \(\frac{1 + n v}{n - v}\) — Incorrect, as the denominator has the wrong sign for \(v\).
- **Option D**: \(\frac{1 - n v}{n + v}\) — Incorrect, as the numerator has the wrong sign for \(v\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
