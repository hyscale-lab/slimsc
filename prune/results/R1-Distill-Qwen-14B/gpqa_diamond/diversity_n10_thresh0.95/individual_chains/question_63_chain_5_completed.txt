Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule in its fundamental state. The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, a diatomic molecule can be treated as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are quantized for both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the problem says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, but I think the key part is that the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually means the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So for the vibration, that's the first vibrational level, n=0, and for rotation, the lowest rotational state, which is J=0. But wait, no—wait, in some models, the fundamental vibrational state is n=0, but also considering rotation, the ground state might involve the lowest rotational energy.

Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, which is n=0. But rotation is another degree of freedom. So the overall energy is a combination of vibrational and rotational energies.

But the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy after absorbing a photon. So I think this is a transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next higher energy state. But what's the next state?

In quantum mechanics, the transitions can involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But I think for the minimal energy transition, the molecule would absorb a photon that causes it to go from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state, i.e., n=0 to n=1, but possibly also changing rotational state.

Wait, but the problem states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, so the energy levels are the sum of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the fundamental state is the lowest rotational and vibrational state, which is n=0 and J=0.

Wait, but if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state of both vibrations and rotation. So when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher state. The next lowest state would be the one with the least energy increase, so probably the next vibrational state. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, the next energy level could be the next rotational state, like J=1. Because rotating might require less energy than vibrating. Hmm, but I think the vibrational transitions are usually higher in energy than rotational transitions. Because the vibrational energy levels have a larger spacing than rotational, since the angular frequency for vibration is much higher than that for rotation.

Wait, the problem gives the angular frequency for vibration as w = 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy spacing would be hf, where f is the frequency, which is w/(2pi). So the energy per photon for vibrational transition would be higher than rotational transitions.

So if the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy would be either n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). Which one is lower in energy?

Let me think about the energy terms. Vibrational energy is given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. Rotational energy is E_rot = (J (J+1) ) (ħ²)/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 would be h w (since it's (n+1/2) to (n+1/2 +1), so the difference is h w). The rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 would be (using E_rot formula):

E_rot for J=0 is 0.5 * (ħ²)/(2I)
E_rot for J=1 is 3 * (ħ²)/(2I)
So the difference is 2.5 * (ħ²)/(2I) = (5/2) (ħ²/(2I)) )? Wait, no, wait: E_rot J=1 is 3 (from J=1, (1)(2) = 2, but wait, no: E_rot is (J)(J+1) times some constant. So J=0: E=0 (since (0)(1) = 0). J=1: E=(1)(2) = 2. So the difference is 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) )= (ħ²)/(I). 

Wait, let me correct that. E_rot for J is (J (J+1)) * (ħ² / (2 I)). So for J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, it's (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is ħ²/(I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

So which is smaller: h w or ħ²/(I)?

Because if ħ²/(I) is smaller than h w, then the rotational transition would require less energy, so the photon would have lower energy and hence lower momentum.

Wait, but h w is the energy difference for vibration from n=0 to n=1. And ħ^2/(I) is the energy for J=1.

We need to compare these two to see which is smaller.

But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule can either go to n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. Whichever requires lower energy. So the lower energy transition would be the one that's easier to absorb.

So let's compute both energy differences.

First compute E_vib (v=1) - E_vib (v=0) = h w.

E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, so difference is h w.

E_rot for J=1 is (1)(2) (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I). So the difference is ħ²/(I).

Which is smaller: h w or ħ²/(I)?

We need to compute I, the moment of inertia.

I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass.

Given masses Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu.

So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 * 2)/(22) ) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.00e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) ) [in amu] = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

So μ in kg is 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = let's compute that.

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (1.8 * 1.66e-27) + (0.01818 * 1.66e-27 )

1.8 * 1.66 = approx 2.988 → 2.988e-27.

0.01818 * 1.66 ≈ 0.02999 → 0.03e-27 → 3e-29.

So total is about 2.988e-27 + 0.03e-27 = 3.018e-27 kg. Let's round to 3.02e-27 kg.

r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

So now, compute ħ²/(I).

ħ is h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant. h = 6.626e-34 J s. So ħ = 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

Now, ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = let's compute that.

1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.208 ) * 1e-22 ≈ approximately 0.92 * 1e-22 → 9.2e-23 J.

Now, compare this to E_vib, which is h w.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

w = 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J. Hmm, that's a much larger energy than 9.2e-23 J.

So the E_rot (J=1) is about 9.2e-23 J, and E_vib (n=1) is 2.65e-19 J. So E_rot is much smaller. So the next state is the rotational state, J=1, because it's a lower energy transition.

Wait, but wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the next possible state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, whichever requires the least energy. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon would cause a rotational transition.

So the photon must provide the energy difference for the J=0 → J=1 transition in rotation.

Wait, but I thought the question was about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest possible energy increase is the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy should match the energy difference between J=0 and J=1.

But wait, no—wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0). The next state could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. The energy required for n=1 is much larger, so the minimal energy transition would be the rotational one.

Therefore, the photon must supply the energy needed for the rotational transition.

So the energy of the photon is equal to the rotational energy difference: E_rot = ħ²/(I) ≈9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the momentum of the photon, not the energy. Oh right, because the photon's momentum p is related to its energy E by E = p c. Because for a photon, E = pc, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, but wait. The energy of a photon is E = pc, where p is the momentum. So p = E/(c).

So if the energy needed is 9.2e-23 J, then the momentum is 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the given options are of the order 1e-27 or similar. Hmm, this suggests my calculation is off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy difference. Let me go back.

Wait, I computed I as 1.208e-46 kg m². Then ħ²/(I) is (1.055e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46.

Wait, let me recompute that.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = approximately 9.2e-23 J. So that part was correct.

But then E_rot is 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy E_photon should be 9.2e-23 J.

So the momentum p is E_photon / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.2 /3 )e-31 kg m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are much larger, like 1e-27 Ns, which is kg m/s.

Wait, 1e-27 kg m/s is much larger than 3e-31.

Hmm, this suggests I have a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should have considered the vibrational transition instead.

Wait, maybe I messed up the energy levels. Let me think again.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is n=0 (vibrational ground state) and J=0 (rotational ground state). So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher state, which could be either n=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state). But as I found earlier, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the next state would be J=1, n=0.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy.

Wait, maybe I should compute the energy for the vibrational transition again.

E_vib = h w (n+1/2) - h w (n' +1/2) ) when n' = n +1.

So when n=0 and n'=1, E_vib = h w (1 +1/2 - (0 +1/2)) )= h w (1) )= h w.

Wait, h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Which is way higher than the rotational transition's 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy for the rotational transition is 9.2e-23 J, which gives a momentum of 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But looking at the options, none are close to this.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational transition but the vibrational. Because the options don't match the rotational case. Hmm.

Wait the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 N*s

B) 2.3e-27 N*s

C)1.1e-27 N*s

D)1.4e-28 N*s

So all options are in the 1e-28 to 1e-27 range. But my calculation for the rotational photon's momentum was 3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31 N s (since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s).

So none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the molecule is a diatomic, and perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state overall, which could be a combination of vibrational and rotational.

Wait, but the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the lowest energy transition would be the rotational one, but perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition. Because the options don't match the rotational case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the energy levels. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) but in the rotational state J=0. The next state might be J=1, but perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the first excited state of the vibration, i.e., n=1, J=0. No, no, the fundamental state is the ground state.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the fundamental rotational state, but that doesn't make sense because the fundamental state is the lowest.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy difference between the vibrational ground state (n=0) and the next vibrational state (n=1), because the rotational transitions require lower energy, but maybe the question is expecting the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is such that the molecule is in the ground state of rotation and vibration, and the photon causes a transition to the next state, which is either n=1 or J=1. So the question is, which transition requires the photon with the least energy, and hence, the one with the smallest momentum.

Wait, but if the rotational transition requires less energy, that would mean the photon's momentum is smaller. So in that case, perhaps the answer is the rotational momentum.

But in the options given, the smallest p is 1.4e-28 (option D), then A is 1.9e-28, etc.

But according to my earlier calculation, the rotational photon has a momentum of ~3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31 N s, which is much smaller than any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia.

Let me recalculate I.

I = μ r².

Given Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu = approximately 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Compute that:

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's calculate.

1.8 * 1.6605 = approx 2.989.

0.018 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.02989.

So total is 2.989 + 0.02989 ≈ 3.01889 → 3.01889e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = 3.01889e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01889e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ^2 / I.

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ^2 = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So ħ^2 / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.2075 ) *1e-22 = approx 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference is 9.2e-23 J.

Photon energy E = 9.2e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are much larger than this. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy for a vibrational transition, which is much higher.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is close but not exactly matching. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is in the same ballpark.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute E_vib and p.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626 *4 =26.504 → 26.504e-20 → 2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E / c = 2.6504e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = (2.6504 /3 )e-27 kg m/s → approx 0.8835e-27 → 8.835e-28 kg m/s → 8.835e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in the rotational state from J=0 to J=1, but I think I messed up the calculation of the energy difference.

Wait, maybe the rotational energy formula is E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * (ħ^2)/(2I) ). So for J=0, E_rot = 0. For J=1, E_rot = (1*2) * (ħ^2/(2I)) ) = (2) * (ħ^2/(2I)) )= ħ^2 / I.

So the energy difference is ħ^2/(I) which I calculated as 9.2e-23 J. But perhaps I should have considered the energy for the transition from J=0 to J=1, which is 2 * ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I), which is same as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ²/(I).

Let me recompute:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

I is 1.2075e-46 kg m².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2075 ) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but why aren't the options matching any of the transitions I'm considering.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the transition from the ground state, but perhaps from the next state. Wait, no, the molecule is in the fundamental state, so that's the ground state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the first overtone, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, maybe I should think about the total energy levels. The energy levels of a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are given by E = E_vib + E_rot.

In the ground state, E = 0 (vib) + 0 (rot) = 0.

The next possible state would have the lowest possible energy increase, which would be either increasing J or increasing n. Since increasing J from 0 to 1 requires less energy (as E_rot for J=1 is 9.2e-23 J) than increasing n from 0 to 1 (2.65e-19 J), the photon should supply 9.2e-23 J, which corresponds to a momentum of 3.07e-31 N s.

But none of the options are that low. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibration transition, but I think the numbers don't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps for a diatomic molecule, the rotational states are quantized, but the energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

But the question gives the angular frequency for vibration, not for rotation. So perhaps I should compute the rotational angular frequency from the moment of inertia.

The rotational angular frequency is given by w_rot = sqrt( (k * μ) / I ) ), but wait, no, the rotational frequency is connected to the moment of inertia.

Alternatively, the rotational constant B is ħ/(sqrt(2 I k T)), but perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = ħ²/(2 I μ), no, wait, I think B is ħ²/(2 I) or something like that.

Alternatively, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2 I c), but perhaps that's for spectroscopic terms.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant B, which is related to the moment of inertia I.

B = ħ²/(2 I μ), wait, no, I think B is ħ²/(2 I).

Wait, E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = ħ²/(2 I).

So B = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2075e-46 ) ) → (1.112e-68) / (2.415e-46) ) → approx 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, no, because 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = 4.6e-23 J. So B is approx 4.6e-23 J.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot = B * (1)(2) - 0 = 2B = 9.2e-23 J, which matches my earlier calculation.

So the rotational transition energy is 9.2e-23 J, which gives a photon momentum of 3.07e-31 kg m/s, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me think about the units.

Wait, the options are in N·s, which is kg·m/s. So the calculated p is in kg·m/s, correct.

Hmm, maybe the question is not about the rotational transition but about the vibrational transition and I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational transition's momentum again.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28, option C is 1.1e-27.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is not exactly any of the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = ?

Let me compute that precisely.

6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4 )e(-34+14) )= 26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

Then, p = 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, but the closest option is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). Neither is close.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, is the energy for the vibrational transition actually (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w )? No, the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w, because E_vib(n) = (n + ½) h w.

So E(n=1) - E(n=0) = h w.

So that part is correct.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the question is considering the transition to the next state, which could be a combination of vibrational and rotational. But the question says the "next state with the lowest possible energy", which would be the one requiring the least energy, so that's the rotational transition.

Wait, but the options don't fit that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the model being referred to is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, where the energy levels are quantized and the fundamental state is the first vibrational state (n=1) and J=0. That doesn't make sense, though, because the fundamental state is the ground state.

Wait, the question says the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). So perhaps the fundamental state is the first vibrational state, but no, that's not correct. The fundamental state is the ground state.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the vibrational transition and compute the photon's momentum.

Wait, 8.83e-28 N s is close to option A (1.9e-28), but not close. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate E_vib and p again.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 6.626 *4 = 26.504 → 26.504e-20 J → 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg·m/s → 8.83e-28 N·s.

No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the transition to the next state which is the first rotational state, but perhaps the energy is computed differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy in terms of the rotational constant.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2 I) = 4.6e-23 J as before.

So the energy difference is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But again, the momentum is 3.07e-31 N s, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possible mistake: perhaps I confused the vibrational angular frequency with the rotational one. But the question provides the vibrational angular frequency, w =4e14 rad/s.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state of vibration, but that's a larger energy than the rotational transition. So why would the momentum be larger?

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in I.

Wait, let me recompute I.

I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute this accurately.

1.81818 * 1.6605 = ?

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.989e0.

0.01818 * 1.6605e0 = 0.02999e0.

So total is 2.989 + 0.02999 = 3.01899e0 → 3.01899e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.01899e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01899e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207596e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not about the rotational transition but the vibrational. But then why the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state of vibration and rotation, which would be n=1, J=0. But that would require a photon of energy 2.65e-19 J, which gives p=8.83e-28 Ns. None of the options match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to J=1 and n=1. But that would require much higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition that involves both a change in n and J, but that's unlikely for the minimal energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is in a vibrationally excited state but rotationally in the ground state, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational transition but the transition within the vibrational state, which would be a change in J, but that's not possible because J is separate from n.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, μ = (20 * 2 ) / (20 + 2 ) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit. Wait, the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that's higher in energy.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let's look at the options again.

Options are A) 1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

If I'm getting p_photon for the rotational transition as 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option, and for the vibrational as 8.83e-28 Ns, which is not an option, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2.

Wait, perhaps the photon's momentum is twice this value. Let me think.

Wait, in the vibrational transition, the energy is h w. So p = h w / c.

But in the rotational transition, the energy is ħ²/(I), so p is ( ħ²/(I) ) / c.

Wait, perhaps in the rotational transition, the photon's energy is 2B, which I thought is 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but what if the mistake is that the rotational energy difference is 2B, and I used the correct value.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial approach, and the correct answer is actually the rotational transition. But since the options don't have this, perhaps I should consider a different approach.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the problem is about the Raman transition, which involves a change in J by ±2, but that's a higher energy transition. Not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is about the energy difference between the ground state and the first state that includes both vibrational and rotational excitation. But that's not the lowest energy state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the rotational energy and not the vibrational. So the photon must supply the rotational energy.

But I can't reconcile the numbers with the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the angular momentum as if it's a rigid rotor, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition of the rotational state, but the calculation of I was wrong.

Wait, let me recompute I in a different way.

I = μ r².

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) ) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.018e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So I think that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not about the energy transition but about the photon's momentum, but I can't see where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but the energy is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 N s. So the closest option is D)1.4e-28, which is three orders of magnitude larger.

But that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum for a rotational transition, but I'm missing a factor of (h/(2π)).

Wait, no, because for a photon, E = h f = h w/(2π), so E = ħ w.

Wait, perhaps the rotational frequency is related to the angular frequency. Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is ħ²/(2I).

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/I.

So the energy is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transition but the vibrational transition, and the numbers don't match because the options are wrong. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an error in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, wait, maybe the reduced mass is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ).

Yes, correct. So 20 *2/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the available options.

The photon's momentum for the vibrational transition is 8.83e-28 N s, which is not an option, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a third of that. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is about 16% of that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of E_vib. Let me recompute E_vib.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = ?

6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626 *4 =26.504, and exponents: 1e-34 *1e14 =1e-20. So 26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is considering the photon's momentum as p = (h w) / c, but perhaps using a different value for c, like 3e8 m/s. But no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, but the photon's energy is (3/2 h w), which is the first overtone. No, that's higher than the fundamental.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the angular frequency is 4e13 rad/s, which would make E_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e13 = 2.65e-19 *0.1 = 2.65e-20 J, leading to p=8.83e-28 *0.1=8.83e-29 Ns, but that's still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options are wrong.

Given the time I have, maybe I should choose the closest option to the vibrational transition, which is option A:1.9e-28 Ns.

But wait, 8.83e-28 is approximately 4.6 times larger than option A (1.9e-28).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I should compute the energy difference for the vibrational state as (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w. No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would have a higher energy.

Wait, E_rot for J=2 is (2*3) * B =6 B. So the energy difference from J=0 to J=2 is 6 B. 

But that would require higher energy and higher momentum, which doesn't fit the options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1.9e-28, because it's the closest to my vibrational calculation, even though it's not exact.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the photon's momentum is for the rotational transition, and the options have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first vibrational state, which requires a photon with momentum 8.83e-28 Ns, but none of the options match, so perhaps the correct option is not provided. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the bond length is in picometers, but no, it's given as 2 angstroms.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reduced mass is calculated in atomic mass units, but I converted it correctly to kg.

Yes, 1 amu =1.66e-27 kg.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation I have and see which option is the closest, even if it's not exact.

Wait, my calculated p for the rotational transition is 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. For the vibrational transition, it's 8.83e-28, which isn't an option either. So perhaps the problem expects the rotational transition's photon momentum, but none of the options match, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to cause a transition that involves both rotational and vibrational changes. But that complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy using the vibrational frequency and rotational frequency and see.

Wait, the vibrational energy is much higher than rotational. So the minimal energy transition would be rotational. But the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon's momentum to be for the transition from J=0 to J=1, but perhaps I made a mistake in computing the energy.

Wait, another approach: Compute the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 in terms of the given data.

E_rot = ( ħ² ) / (2 I ) * (J (J+1)) → for J=1, E_rot = (1)(2) * (ħ²/(2 I)) )= ħ²/(I).

Which is 9.2e-23 J.

So p = E / c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

No, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the momentum in kg m/s, which is the same as N s. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, another way to calculate I is to compute it as ( (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) * r².

Mx =20 amu =20 *1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu =3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 ) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 ) → wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, μ = (Mx * My ) / (Mx + My ).

Mx =20 amu →20 *1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu →3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 ) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 ) → wait, no, no, that's not correct.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu =20 *1.66e-27 =3.32e-26 kg.

My is 2 amu =2 *1.66e-27 =3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 ) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 ) → numerator is (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 )= 1.10e-52.

Denominator is 3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 = 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = 1.10e-52 / 3.652e-26 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which is 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state which is the first vibrational state, but using only the vibrational energy. So, p=8.83e-28 Ns, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the question, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the rotational transition again.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is given by E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * (h²/(8 π² I)) ), which is another formulation.

Wait, because sometimes E_rot is written as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 π² I) ).

So let's compute B in this case.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

So B = h²/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * (3.1416)^2 * 1.2075e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * (9.8696) *1.2075e-46 → 8*9.8696=78.9568; 78.9568 *1.2075e-46≈95.2e-46.

So B =4.39e-67 /95.2e-46 = 4.39e-67 / 9.52e-45 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1: 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Which is the same as before.

So p =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm not sure how to proceed. I think the correct answer is based on the rotational transition, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option A)1.9e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and the energy is actually (3/2 h w), but that's the energy for the first vibrational state plus the ground rotational state. But no, that doesn't fit the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational frequency as the angular frequency. But in that case, the calculation remains the same.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the options given, perhaps the intended answer is option A.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both vibrational and rotational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
  \]  
  Converting to kg:  
  \[
  \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu r^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.21 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
  \]

- **Angular frequency of vibration**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Vibrational Transition:
The energy difference for a vibrational transition from \( n=0 \) (ground state) to \( n=1 \) (first excited state) is:  
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]  
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \):  
\[
p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
\]  
This value does not match any of the given options.

### Rotational Transition:
The energy difference for a rotational transition from \( J=0 \) (ground state) to \( J=1 \) (first excited state) is:  
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.21 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]  
The momentum of the photon is:  
\[
p = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
\]  
This value is also much smaller than any of the given options.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \( p = 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)  
- **Option B**: \( p = 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \)  
- **Option C**: \( p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \)  
- **Option D**: \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)  

The calculated momentum for the vibrational transition (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)) is closest to **Option A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)), though it is not an exact match. The rotational transition momentum (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \)) is several orders of magnitude smaller than all options, suggesting the problem may prioritize the vibrational transition despite the discrepancy.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given options and the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **Option A**, as it is the closest to the calculated vibrational transition momentum.

**Answer: A**
