Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because organic reactions can be tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, both involving reactions with nitriles or their derivatives. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is another reaction where 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form a carboxylic acid.

Wait, okay, I need to figure out what reagents A and B are from the options given.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. Adding NaCN usually leads me to think about nucleophilic addition. Oh right, ketones can react with cyanide ions in the presence of a suitable acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4. Because the cyanide ion is a nucleophile, it adds to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, what's the product here? It's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures to see.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When NaCN is added, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. The mechanism would involve the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon. Yeah, that makes sense. So the reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+, because the reaction of ketones with CN- typically uses an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic.

So for part A, the reagent is H3O+ or maybe another acid. Looking at the options, options A, B, and C have different choices for A. Option D has A as NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is used in other types of reactions, like the reduction of carbonyl groups maybe? Or in the hydroboration of alkenes? Hmm, but in this case, for the cyanohydrin formation, I think an acid catalyst is necessary. So A is likely H3O+.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is the corresponding carboxylic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a COOH group. How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, they usually form carboxylic acids, while under basic conditions, they form carboxylates which can be acidified later.

The reagent B is given as H2O, but that doesn't make sense on its own. Oh wait, maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps it's not the entire reagent. Oh wait, the question says B is H2O, but that's the solvent perhaps? Or maybe it's part of the reaction conditions. Alternatively, perhaps B is an acid catalyst like HCl or another acid, providing the necessary protons.

So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. For that, I think you need strong acidic conditions. HCl (HCl) is a common acid used for such hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe it's done under aqueous acidic conditions with something like H2O and HCl.

Looking at the options, for reagent B, options A and C have HCl. Options B and D have other choices like CH3COOH. Wait, CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weaker acid. So for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, do you need a strong acid or a weak one?

I recall that the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done under different conditions. For example, using HCl and water, or maybe using a base followed by acid workup. Alternatively, sometimes the nitrile is treated with a strong acid like HCl in H2O, which would protonate the nitrile and lead to the formation of the carboxylic acid upon hydrolysis.

So for the second part, B (the reagent) is HCl. Because the product is the carboxylic acid, not the salt. So the reaction conditions must be acidic, and HCl would provide the necessary H+ ions to facilitate the hydrolysis.

Putting it all together: reagent A is H3O+ (acid catalyst) and reagent B is HCl (acid for hydrolysis). Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that would fit.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. But NaHSO3 is a bisulfite, which I'm not sure would be suitable for the cyanohydrin formation. I think that reaction requires an acid catalyst like H3O+ or H2SO4, not a sulfite.

So the correct option is A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a suitable acid catalyst for this reaction, as it facilitates the formation of the cyanohydrin product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This requires acidic conditions to protonate the nitrile and drive the hydrolysis reaction. HCl is a strong acid commonly used for this purpose, as it ensures the formation of the carboxylic acid directly. Other acids, such as CH₃COOH, are weaker and less effective for this reaction.

Considering the options, option A (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl) satisfies both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for the cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is appropriate for the nitrile hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid. The other options either use incorrect reagents for one or both reactions.

Answer: A
