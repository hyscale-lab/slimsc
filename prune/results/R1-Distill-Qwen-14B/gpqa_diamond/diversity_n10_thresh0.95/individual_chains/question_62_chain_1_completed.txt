--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. I need to pick the correct sequence of reagents from the options given.

First, I'll try to understand the target molecule: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. It looks like a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached. So, putting it all together, the molecule has two cyclohexane rings connected via a hydroxymethyl group, and one of them has a carbonyl group as well.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, the structure is a six-membered ring, one of the carbons is connected to a triple bond, which is probably between two more carbons, but wait, no—ethynyl is like C≡C- group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached?

Wait, no, wait. Ethynyl is the acetylene group, so it's CH2-C≡C-? No, wait, ethynyl is C≡C-H. So if it's ethynylcyclohexane, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons is connected to a C≡CH group. So it's cyclohexane with a terminal alkyne.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps we're forming a ring or connecting two rings somehow. Also, the target has a carbonyl group, which suggests oxidation or some kind of aldehyde formation.

Let me think about the possible steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

First, maybe the triple bond can be used in some way. Triple bonds can undergo various reactions, like hydrogenation, hydration, or other additions. But let's think about the reagents in the options.

Looking at the options, all of them start with NaNH2 and something else. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. It's used in alkyne chemistry, like for deprotonating terminal alkynes to form acetylides.

So the first step in all options is NaNH2 with a chlorinated compound, either methyl chloride or ethyl chloride or methanol. Wait, NaNH2 and methyl chloride—maybe that's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. For example, the terminal alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) is deprotonated by NaNH2 to form an acetylide. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate the acetylide. So reaction would be: the acetylide (strong base) attacking methyl chloride, leading to the substitution of the chloride. So the product would be ethynylcyclohexane with a methyl group added via the triple bond. Wait, but the triple bond is in ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡C-? Or wait, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group, right?

So when you deprotonate that with NaNH2, you get the acetylide ion: cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+. Then methyl chloride would react, so the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride to give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, but wait, that's not possible because the acetylide is at the end. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡C-CH2- attached to the ring? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. Deprotonating gives cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+.

Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would then react, where the acetylide would attack the methyl group. So the product would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. That would form a propargyl group—like a four-carbon chain attached to the ring? Wait, no. Let me draw this. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH. Deprotonating that gives -C≡C^- Na^+. Then, methyl chloride would provide a methyl group. So the product would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So the alkyne becomes -C≡C-CH3. But that's a substitution on the acetylide. So the first step would be making a longer alkyne.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a triple bond. So maybe after the alkyne is extended, the next step would be to hydrogenate it.

Looking at the options, after the first step, the second step varies. Let me see.

Option A: H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation. So if the product after step 1 is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add hydrogen across the triple bond, converting it into a single bond, so cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think. When you hydrogenate an alkyne, depending on the conditions, it can become cis or trans, or if it's a terminal alkyne, it would hydrogenate to a cis (or in some cases, trans) alkene. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, hydrogenating a triple bond with H2 and a catalyst like palladium (probably Lindlar catalyst) would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. But if the catalyst is just Pd without any poison, it might hydrogenate further. Wait, but if you have enough H2 and Pd, the triple bond could be hydrogenated all the way to a single bond. So, for example, a propargyl group would become a propyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is reduced to a trans double bond if using a different catalyst, but the reagent here is H2/Pd, which is typically for hydrogenation of triple bonds to cis alkenes, but under certain conditions, it might continue to hydrogenate further.

Wait, but the target molecule doesn't have a double bond. It has a cyclohexyl group connected via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps after making the extended alkyne, hydrogenation would convert it into some alkane. So, initial steps: alkyne → longer alkyne via alkylation, then hydrogenation to a single bond.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. So maybe the next step is to form a cyclohexane ring attached via a CH(OH)CH2- group. Hmm, perhaps through some kind of cyclopropane ring-opening reaction or some other way. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's look at all the steps in the options.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms a longer alkyne, as I thought.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond. So the triple becomes a single, so the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no: ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. After step 1, it becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would convert the triple bond to a single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would make a four-carbon chain, but the target probably has a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. After step 1 (NaNH2 and CH3Cl), the acetylide is treated with methyl chloride, which would add a methyl group. So the triple bond would become -C≡C-CH3. So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond. The hydrogenation of an internal alkyne (like -C≡C-) would typically produce a cis double bond, but under high pressure and with excess H2, perhaps it would go all the way to a single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that seems like a propane chain, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH)CH2- group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the next step is to form a ketone or an aldehyde. Wait, looking at the target molecule, it has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part, which is a cyclohexane with a CHO group. So perhaps after hydrogenation, we need to form a carbonyl group.

But in option A, the third step is Ba(OH)2, which is used for elimination reactions, perhaps. Then, the fourth step is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which sounds like a oxidation condition, perhaps for cleavage of a diol or something else. Alternatively, HgSO4 in H2SO4 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps the steps are as follows: After alkyne extension and hydrogenation, we form some diol, then oxidize it to a carbonyl.

But let's think about each option step by step.

Option B: Step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So similar, but using ethyl chloride instead of methyl. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used for deprotonation or elimination. Then step 3 is O3 (ozone) and H2O (workup), which is ozonolysis. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent.

Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So perhaps step 2 here is deprotonation and elimination to form an alkene, which would then be cleaved by ozonolysis.

But let's see. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 would form a longer alkyne, ethyl group added via NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base which can deprotonate to form a strong base, perhaps for elimination. So maybe the alkyne is converted into an alkene via elimination. Wait, but wait, after adding an ethyl group, we have a longer alkyne, say cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, perhaps step 2 would induce elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, but step 2 in option B is Li in liquid NH3. That's a method for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene via elimination. But wait, the alkyne is in a position where elimination could form a triple bond again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne becomes a diene through some process, but I'm not quite sure.

But let me think: after step 1, the alkyne is extended. Then, step 2 is elimination, which would break a bond and form a double bond. So, for example, if we have an alkyne with adjacent substituents, eliminating would form a double bond. But I'm not sure how that would play out here.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reducing the carbonyl groups. But that might not be necessary if we want aldehyde groups.

Alternatively, maybe the process is different.

Option C: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Wait, H2 with Pd and CaCO3 is a catalyst for hydrogenation, perhaps for alkyne hydrogenation to cis-alkene or further to alkane. Step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a workup for ozonolysis, perhaps to form ketones or aldehydes. Step 4 is Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the pathway is alkyne to alkyne with methyl, then hydrogenation to an alkane, then ozonolysis to form carbonyls, then something else.

Alternatively, maybe the synthesis involves forming a diol, then oxidizing it.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, methanol as a methylating agent? Deprotonating the alkyne with NaNH2, then treating with methanol would perhaps form an ether or something else. But I'm not sure about that. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which again is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. Step 3 is O3 (CH3)2S, which is a workup for ozonolysis, and step 4 is NH4OH.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to outline each option's process.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring and a carbaldehyde group.

So, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne is extended (step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride)
2. Then, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond (step 2: H2/Pd)
3. Then, some kind of oxidation to form a carbonyl group (from an alcohol, perhaps)
4. Maybe a diol is formed, which then undergoes oxidation to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide or something else.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group to another cyclohexane ring, which has a carbonyl group. So maybe the process involves forming a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl, and then some elimination or other reactions.

Wait, perhaps after the alkylation and hydrogenation steps, we have a diol formed through some dihydroxylation, which then is oxidized.

Wait, let's think about each option.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would give a three-carbon chain. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe after hydrogenation, we have a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2CH2CH3. But that doesn't seem to fit the target.

Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps used for elimination reactions, like forming an epoxide or something else. Or maybe it's used for dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but in the target, we have a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for some kind of ring-opening or epoxide formation. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's usually under different conditions.

Wait, another possibility: Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of alcohols, but I'm not sure.

Step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. These are typically used for the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. Wait, HgSO4 in H2SO4 is Jones' reagent, which is used for oxidations. So if there's a primary alcohol present, it would oxidize to an aldehyde.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne extended to longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenated to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Then Ba(OH)2 does something, perhaps epoxidation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH)CH2- group. So perhaps, after the initial alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule has a CH2-CH2-CH3 group. Then, perhaps some oxidation would form a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after hydrogenation, the molecule has a CH2-CHOH-CH2- group, which upon oxidation would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step in each option.

Option A:

1. ethynylcyclohexane → NaNH2, CH3Cl → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to CH2-CH2-CH3: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, that's a three-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, but what would be eliminated?

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong in the hydrogenation step. Maybe H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis alkene, not a single bond. So step 2 would produce cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait: the triple bond is between two carbons, so when hydrogenated to single bond, it becomes two single bonds. So the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. So a three-carbon chain.

Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Maybe that's for epoxidation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 can cause elimination reactions, like in the formation of epoxides or maybe for forming ethers.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, Ba(OH)2 would do something else. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis double bond (if using Lindlar catalyst), making a cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2 group as a cis di-substituted alkene. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track. Let me think about another approach.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH)CH2- group. So perhaps the hydroxymethyl group comes from an epoxide ring-opening or some kind of diol formation.

Wait, perhaps the process is as follows: ethynylcyclohexane is first alkylated to form a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated to a diol via some dihydroxylation, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but dihydroxylation typically uses something like OsO4, which isn't in the options. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then treated with some dihydroxylation conditions, but that's not present.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → a strong base. Maybe this induces elimination, converting the alkyne into an alkene.

Wait, but alkyne elimination to form an alkene? That's possible under certain conditions. For example, treatment with a strong base could cause the alkyne to eliminate a proton and form a triple bond again, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group is added, and then the alkyne is converted into an alkene via deprotonation and elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, but that doesn't fit the reagent.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is deprotonating and forming a strong base, which could cause elimination, forming a triple bond again but in a different position.

Then, step 3 is O3, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyls. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which could be a workup for the ozonolysis, perhaps reducing the carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target molecule.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But wait, if the molecule is a single bond, it's CH2CH2CH3. Ozonolysis is for alkenes, so if there's an alkene here, maybe it's part of a ring.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't complete, and we have a cis-alkene instead. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

But how? Let's think: after step 2, if the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then step 3 (ozonolysis) would break the double bond into two aldehyde groups. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups, which could then be further processed.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target molecule.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → maybe forming an ether? Not sure.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent. Maybe the alkyne is deprotonated, then methanol acts as an electrophile, adding a methyl group. So step 1 would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3? Or maybe some kind of substitution.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form an ether. Hmm, unclear.

Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, a strong base, perhaps for elimination. Step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is ozonolysis. Step 4 is NH4OH, which is a reducing agent.

Putting this together, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene, then ozonolysis cleaves it into carbonyls, which are reduced. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

NaNH2 and methanol → form a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a -CH(OH)CH2- group. So maybe that's formed via a Williamson ether synthesis or some kind of epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, another thought: the target's structure suggests that two cyclohexane rings are connected via a -(CH2OH)CH2- group, and one of the rings has a CHO group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a bridge between the two rings, introducing an alcohol group, and then oxidizing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a cyclopropane ring, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is converted into an epoxide first, then opened to form the diol, which is then oxidized to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but the reagents don't include epoxidation conditions. Epoxidation typically uses peracids like mCPBA, which aren't in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each step in the options and what reagents do.

Option C's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a workup that gives aldehydes and ketones without overoxidizing. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps used for elimination or for forming epoxides, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of alcohols. For example, primary alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes using Ba(OH)2 under certain conditions, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 may be used in the Birch reduction to form diols from aromatic rings, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

But the problem is that the reagents don't include dihydroxylation reagents like OsO4 or other oxidizing agents for diols.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps form a diol via some other method, then that diol is oxidized.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, which is then dihydroxylated, but without the right reagents, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct sequence is in one of the options.

Looking again at the target molecule, perhaps the aldehyde group is formed by oxidation of an alcohol, which is formed from an epoxide.

Wait, but I don't see any steps involving epoxide formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde comes from the oxidation of a primary alcohol, which is formed from some earlier step.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne extension (NaNH2, CH3Cl) → longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation → alkene.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the alkene into two carbonyls.

4. Workup with NH4OH (which is a mild reducing agent) → reduces the carbonyls to alcohols or aldehydes.

Wait, but step 3 in option B is ozonolysis, step 4 is NH4OH. So if the ozonolysis produces ketones or aldehydes, then NH4OH (which is a mild reducing agent like NaBH4 but without the strength) might not reduce them. Wait, no, NH4OH is more of a source of NH4+ and OH-; perhaps it's used in the workup after ozonolysis to avoid overoxidation.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't leading me anywhere. Maybe I should think about the target molecule's structure and how each step could contribute to it.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH(OH)CH2 group. So maybe the CH(OH)CH2 group comes from an epoxide ring-opening, where the oxygen attacks a neighboring carbon, leading to the formation of an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the process involves forming a carbonyl group via oxidation and then some kind of condensation reaction.

Wait, perhaps after the alkyne is hydrogenated, we have a secondary alcohol which is then oxidized to a ketone. But the target has an aldehyde group, which is a primary carbonyl.

Alternatively, let's think about each option's steps and see which sequence could produce the target.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond. If it's hydrogenated all the way, it becomes a single bond. So structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But ozonolysis works on alkenes. If the structure is a single bond after step 2, ozonolysis can't do anything. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond. If step 2 is H2 with a poisoned catalyst, it would stop at the cis alkene. So after step 2, the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere, perhaps. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But then, the target has a single CH(OH)CH2 group. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne extended to propargyl.

2. Hydrogenate to cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two aldehydes.

4. Then, perhaps, some kind of aldehyde reaction to form the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, each carbonyl could be converted into a cyclohexane ring. But that seems unlikely without a ring-forming step.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde from ozonolysis is further processed to form the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe looking for the correct reagents for each step would help.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group, suggesting that at some point, a diol is formed, which upon oxidation becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, but how would that happen with the given reagents?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via some hydration step, then oxidized.

Wait, but the reagents don't include any for hydration. Wait, the hydration of alkynes can be done with HgSO4 and H2SO4 under certain conditions. Oh, right! The hydration of alkynes to ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne with HgSO4 and H2SO4 would produce a ketone, because the triple bond is between two carbons, but in a terminal alkyne, the triple bond is at the end, so hydration would give a ketone for internal alkynes, and an aldehyde for terminal? Wait, no, wait: terminal alkynes (like ethynyl group) upon hydration would give a ketone (propan-2-one). Wait, no, wait: hydration of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) would give R-C(OH)CH3, which upon protonation would become R-C(O)CH3, which is a ketone. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the steps involve hydrating the alkyne to form a ketone, then some kind of oxidation or reduction to form an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (but without OsO4, that's not possible).

Another angle: the presence of O3 in some options suggests that ozonolysis is part of the process, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So perhaps the earlier steps form a double bond, which is then cleaved.

Let me think about option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So the alkyne is deprotonated, then treated with methanol. Could this form an ether? Like cyclohexyl-OCH3?

Wait, that doesn't make sense, because the acetylide would attack the methanol's methyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the acetylide attacks a methyl group from methanol.

Wait, methanol is CH3OH. If the acetylide (strong base) attacks the methyl carbon, perhaps it would form cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would abstract a proton from methanol, leading to the formation of an alkoxide.

Hmm, I'm not confident about that step.

Option D's step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base, often used for deprotonation or elimination. Step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is ozonolysis. Step 4 is NH4OH, which is used in workup after ozonolysis, perhaps to prevent overoxidation or to form aldehydes.

Putting this together, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene via elimination (step 2), then ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups, which are then processed.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

Wait, maybe the correct option is option C:

Steps: Alkyne extension → hydrogenation → ozonolysis → Ba(OH)2.

But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → longer alkyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate to cis-alkene.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S → cleave alkene into two carbonyl groups.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless it's used in a specific oxidation context.

Alternatively, maybe the cleavage from ozonolysis gives two carbonyl groups, and then Ba(OH)2 is used for some elimination or other reaction.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each step's outcome and match it to the target.

The target has two cyclohexane rings connected by a -CH(OH)CH2- group and a CHO group on one ring.

So, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne extended with methyl group (NaNH2, CH3Cl) → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene (H2/Pd) → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 as a cis di-substituted alkene.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, the hydrogenation could add two H's to each carbon, making a single bond.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond in between, like cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation converts the alkyne into a trans-alkene, but I'm not certain.

3. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the middle carbons, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes: cyclohexyl-CHO and another aldehyde.

But the target has a single aldehyde group, so perhaps one end is cleaved off.

Wait, but the target has two cyclohexane rings. So maybe the ozonolysis fragments are used to form the rings.

Alternatively, perhaps ozonolysis is followed by some kind of cyclization.

I'm getting too stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps this comes from an epoxide ring-opening, where the oxygen attacks a neighboring carbon, creating an alcohol.

But without an epoxide formation step, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the synthesis involves forming a Grignard reagent or some nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but all the options start with NaNH2 and a chlorinated compound, which points to alkylation of the acetylide.

So step 1 is adding a methyl or ethyl group to the alkyne.

Step 2 in each option varies.

Looking back, the target molecule's structure suggests that we have a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH(OH)CH2- group. So perhaps the steps after alkylation and hydrogenation involve forming this group.

If after step 1 and 2, the structure is a cyclohexyl group with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group, then perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation, forming a diol, which then is oxidized to a carbonyl.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, another thought: The target has a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)CH2-), which suggests that an epoxide or some cyclic ether was opened to form a diol, which is then perhaps oxidized.

But without an epoxide, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclopropane formation, but that's probably not the case here.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about the oxidation steps in the options.

Option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's Jones' reagent, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but under certain conditions, maybe to aldehydes if controlled. So perhaps after forming a primary alcohol, this step would oxidize it to an aldehyde.

But how would the primary alcohol be formed?

Option A's steps are:

1. Alkyne extended with methyl.

2. Hydrogenated to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2.

4. Jones' reagent.

Hmm, perhaps step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is used for the oxidation of alcohols. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base but not an oxidizing agent. Unless it's used in a specific context, like for epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule is a diol. Then, step 3 (Ba(OH)2) could cause elimination to form a carbonyl group. Then, step 4 oxidizes it further.

But without knowing the exact steps, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct sequence of reactions that would form the target.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, it's a cyclohexane ring (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) with a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

So the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2- attached to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, which then undergoes some addition.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is alkyne extension, step 2 is hydrogenation to a ketone, and then further steps form the substituent.

But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group connected via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the synthesis is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne extended (NaNH2, CH3Cl) → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

4. Workup → aldehydes, which can then form rings or other structures.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, step 3 could be Ba(OH)2, which perhaps performs an elimination to form a carbonyl.

But without knowing, I'm stuck.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the steps.

The target has a CHO group, which suggests oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps the steps include forming a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Looking at option D: step 4 is NH4OH, which is used in the workup after ozonolysis. If ozonolysis produces carbonyl groups, and then NH4OH is used to reduce them, but that's for ketones to secondary alcohols, but the target has an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe option B:

Step 1: Alkyne extended with ethyl chloride → longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → elimination to form an alkene.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → cleaves to carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → maybe prevents overoxidation, leaving aldehydes.

So, the aldehyde would then be part of the target.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Looking back, the target's structure suggests that after alkylation and hydrogenation, there's a diol formed, which is then oxidized. But without the exact reagents, it's tough.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne extension.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis → cleave into aldehydes.

4. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps eliminate to form the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, which forms diols from aromatic rings, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes. Wait, but I thought that's done with other reagents.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for the most plausible option.

The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring.

The correct sequence would involve:

- Alkyne extension via NaNH2 and methyl chloride.

- Hydrogenation to an alkane.

- Oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option A has step 4 as H2SO4 and HgSO4, which is Jones' reagent for oxidation. So perhaps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne extended to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps forms a diol or some epoxide.

4. Jones' reagent → oxidizes a primary alcohol to aldehyde.

But how is the diol formed?

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, Ba(OH)2 is used for some kind of elimination to form a double bond, which upon ozonolysis would cleave, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used to form an epoxide, but without an alkene, that's not possible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But honestly, I'm getting stuck, and perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the reagents.

The correct answer is likely option C, as it involves ozonolysis after hydrogenation, which could lead to cleavage and formation of carbonyl groups, which could then form the aldehyde and the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, considering the presence of Jones' reagent in option A for oxidation, perhaps option A is correct.

Wait, another angle: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH)CH2- group. So perhaps that group is formed via a Grignard reaction, but I don't see any Grignard reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

But without solid reasoning, I'll have to make a guess.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option C.


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring and a carbaldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Observations:
1. **Target Molecule**: The molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH(OH)CH2-) attached to another cyclohexane ring and a carbaldehyde group (-CHO).
2. **Starting Material**: Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne (-C≡CH) group.
3. **Reagents**:
   - **NaNH2**: A strong base used for deprotonating terminal alkynes to form acetylides.
   - **Methyl/Ethyl Chloride**: Used for alkylating the acetylide.
   - **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenation catalyst, typically reduces alkynes to alkanes or alkenes.
   - **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or oxidation.
   - **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O (Jones' Reagent)**: Oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes or carboxylic acids.
   - **O3 (Ozonolysis)**: Cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups.
   - **NH4OH**: A mild reducing agent, often used in ozonolysis workup.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Ethynylcyclohexane is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to extend the alkyne to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: Likely used for elimination or oxidation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Oxidizes a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. However, the pathway to form the hydroxymethyl group is ambiguous.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Extends the alkyne to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, possibly for elimination to form an alkene.
3. **O3, H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene to form carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Reduces carbonyls to alcohols or aldehydes. However, the sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxymethyl group.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Extends the alkyne to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves any double bonds to form carbonyl groups, but the intermediate after hydrogenation is unclear.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: Likely used for elimination or oxidation, but the exact role is ambiguous.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Methanol may act as a methylating agent, but the exact reaction is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, possibly for elimination.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Reduces carbonyls to alcohols or aldehydes. However, the pathway to form the hydroxymethyl group is unclear.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule's structure suggests the need for forming a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde. Option A includes Jones' reagent (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O), which is well-suited for oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. While the exact pathway to form the hydroxymethyl group is ambiguous, Option A aligns best with the required transformations.

**Answer: A**
