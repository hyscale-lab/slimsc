Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I think I need to figure out what's happening at each of these points. Let's start by understanding the initial solution after dilution.

So, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20 cm³ of water makes the total volume 40 cm³. To find the new concentration, I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = (1)/40 = 0.0125 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.0125 M.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But for the initial dilution, I think that's correct. The next step is the titration with NaOH.

When titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present initially. But wait, the initial moles in the diluted solution: volume is 40 cm³=0.04 L, concentration 0.0125 M. Moles = 0.04 * 0.0125 = 0.0005 mol.

The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH at equivalence point will be (moles NaOH)/(M NaOH) = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L = 5 cm³. Wait, but the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the way to equivalence. So 25% of 5 cm³ is 1.25 cm³ of NaOH added. But perhaps it's better to calculate the moles instead.

Let me think again. At 25% titration, 25% of the required moles of NaOH have been added. So the moles of NaOH added will be 0.25 * 0.0005 mol = 0.000125 mol.

Wait, but the initial solution is 0.0125 M CH3COOH in 40 cm³. When we add some NaOH, it will neutralize some of the acetic acid, forming acetate ions.

So, the first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. Let's tackle that.

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.000125 mol. So this reacts with the same amount of CH3COOH, producing CH3COO^-.

So, the initial moles of CH3COOH in 0.04 L (40 cm³) is 0.0005 mol. After adding NaOH, 0.000125 mol reacts, so the remaining CH3COOH is 0.0005 - 0.000125 = 0.000375 mol. And the moles of CH3COO^- formed are 0.000125 mol.

But wait, the volume has increased. So the total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus the NaOH added. Hmm, but wait, the NaOH volume is 1.25 cm³ for 25%? Because 5 cm³ is the equivalence point, so 25% is 1.25 cm³. So the total volume is 40 + 1.25 = 41.25 cm³? Or wait, perhaps in such calculations, the volumes may be considered additive. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here because it's a buffer solution. Because at 25% titration, only part of the acid has been neutralized, so we have a buffer of acid and conjugate base.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. 1.85e-5 is approximately 1.85 x 10^-5. So pKa = log(1/1.85e-5) = log(5.405e4) approximately. Wait, wait, pKa is -log(Ka), so log(1.85e-5) is around 4.736 because 10^-5 is 5, and 1.85 is a bit higher, like 4.736. So pKa is about 4.736.

Wait, using calculator: log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, but for calculations, perhaps exact value is needed. Let me compute it properly. Alternatively, perhaps just use pKa as 4.73 for simplicity, because that's commonly known for acetic acid.

So, using the Henderson equation. The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (moles of A^-)/(moles of HA). 

At 25% titration, moles of A^- (acetate) is 0.000125 mol, and moles of HA (acetic acid) is 0.000375 mol.

So the ratio is (0.000125)/(0.000375) = 1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 + log(0.333...) ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, option D is 4.57 and 6.92, so 4.26 is close.

But wait, wait. Another approach: perhaps I should compute the concentrations, considering the total volume.

Wait, the initial volume after dilution is 40 mL. Then adding 1.25 mL of NaOH solution. So total volume is 41.25 mL.

So for [A^-], the moles are 0.000125 mol. So concentration is 0.000125 / 0.04125 L ≈ 0.00303 M.

For [HA], 0.000375 mol / 0.04125 L ≈ 0.00909 M.

So the ratio is 0.00303 / 0.00909 ≈ 0.333. So same as before.

So pH is pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, about 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is close. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

Next, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions is given by the moles of acetate divided by the total volume.

Moles of acetate: same as initial moles of acetic acid, 0.0005 mol.

Total volume: initial 40 mL + 5 mL (equivalence point, as calculated before) = 45 mL, which is 0.045 L.

Concentration of acetate: 0.0005 / 0.045 = 0.01111 M.

Now, the acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then, the hydrolysis equation will set up as follows. Let's let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x^2) / (0.01111 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.01111, so we can approximate 0.01111 - x ≈ 0.01111.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.01111 ≈ (5.405e-10) * 0.01111 ≈ 5.999e-12.

x ≈ sqrt(5.999e-12) ≈ 7.746e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approximately 7.746e-6 M. Then pOH is -log(7.746e-6) ≈ 5.111. So pH is 14 - 5.111 = 8.889. Wait, that's about 8.89.

Hmm, none of the options match this. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recompute.

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kw is 1e-14.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Molarity of acetate is 0.0005 mol / 0.045 L = 0.01111 M, correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. So Kb = x² / (0.01111). So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.01111 = 5.405e-10 * 1.111e-2 = 5.405 * 1.111e-12 ≈ 6e-12.

x = sqrt(6e-12) = about 2.449e-6 M.

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, no: let me calculate 5.405e-10 * 0.01111.

Hmm, 0.01111 is approximately 1.111e-2. So 5.405e-10 * 1.111e-2 = 5.405 *1.111e-12 = let's compute 5.405 * 1.111.

5.405 * 1 = 5.405, 5.405 *0.1=0.5405, 5.405 *0.01=0.05405, 5.405 *0.001=0.005405.

So 5.405 * 1.111 is approximately 5.405 + 0.5405 + 0.05405 + 0.005405 = approx 5.405 + 0.5405 = 5.9455, plus 0.05405 → 6.0, plus 0.005405 → 6.005405. So 6.005e-12, so x² =6.005e-12 → x ≈ sqrt(6e-12) = 7.746e-6 M.

Wait, but wait, 5.405e-10 * 0.01111 is 5.405e-10 * 1.111e-2 = (5.405 * 1.111) * 1e-12.

5.405 * 1.111 is approximately 5.405 * 1.111 ≈ let's compute:

5 *1.111 =5.555,

0.405 *1.111 ≈ 0.405 + 0.0405 + 0.00405 ≈ 0.44955.

So total is approximately 5.555 + 0.44955 ≈ 6.00455. So yes, 6.00455e-12.

So x = sqrt(6.00455e-12) = approx 7.75e-6 M.

So [OH^-] =7.75e-6 → pOH is log(7.75e-6) → log(7.75) is about 0.889, so pOH is 5.889 → pH is 14 -5.889 =8.111.

Wait, that's about 8.11. But none of the options show this. Looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D: 4.57; 6.92

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Alternative approach: Maybe the solution isn't as simple because the concentration is low, but I might have made a mistake in the volumes.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles and concentrations.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of acetate are 0.0005 mol.

The total volume is the initial 40 mL plus the NaOH added at equivalence, which is 5 mL. So 45 mL = 0.045 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.0005 / 0.045 = 0.01111 M.

Then, Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 =5.405e-10.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = (x)(x) / (0.01111 - x) ≈ x² / 0.01111.

So x² = 0.01111 * 5.405e-10 = 5.999e-12.

x = sqrt(5.999e-12) ≈ 7.746e-6 M. So [OH^-] =7.746e-6 → pOH is log(7.746e-6) = 5.105 → pH=14-5.105=8.895.

Wait, that's about 8.9. But none of the options have that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Let me check the initial moles again.

Wait, initial volume after dilution is 40 mL. Moles of acetic acid: 0.0125 M * 0.04 L = 0.0005 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, all this converts to acetate, so 0.0005 mol.

Volume at equivalence is 40 mL + 5 mL =45 mL. So 0.045 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.0005 / 0.045 = 0.01111 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise pKa value. Let me calculate pKa more accurately.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) = ?

Using a calculator:

log(1.85) is approximately 0.267. So pKa = 4.733.

So, when using the Henderson equation earlier, I used 4.73, which is correct.

Wait, but for the equivalence point, another approach is to prepare a solution of sodium acetate and calculate the pH using the Kb.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recompute.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 /1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 →5.405e-10. Correct.

So, the calculation seems correct. But looking at the options, none have an equivalence point pH of around 8.9. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: equivalence pH 8.52, which is lower than what I calculated. Option D has 6.92, which is acidic, which can't be right. Option B has 6.73, which is also acidic. Option C has 7.00, which is neutral. Hmm, none match.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Oh wait, wait a second. At the equivalence point, the reaction produces sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution should be basic, as I did. So why are the options not matching?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid, then 20 cm³ water. So total 40 cm³, correct.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 mol. Oh wait a second! Wait, no. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, after diluting to 40 cm³, the concentration becomes 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, wait, this is a miscalculation. Oh no, I think I messed up here earlier.

Wait, wait, I'm so confused. Let me recompute that.

Wait, initial volume of acetic acid solution: 20 cm³, 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct. Then adding 20 cm³ water makes the total volume 40 cm³. So new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M.

Oh wait no! I think earlier I made a mistake in the initial dilution calculation. Because 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³, volume is 40 cm³, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, not 0.0125 M as I previously thought. Oh! So that changes everything.

So that's where I went wrong. I thought it was 0.0125 M, but it's actually 0.025 M.

So, going back. The diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed: 0.001 mol. So volume of NaOH is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³.

Wait, because 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

So, at 25% titration, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So, moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, initial acetic acid is 0.001 mol. After adding NaOH, 0.00025 mol reacts:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 -0.00025= 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: initial 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ =42.5 cm³ =0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] =0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = 4.73 + log(0.3333) ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈4.253.

So pH at 25% is approximately 4.25.

Now, at equivalence point. All 0.001 mol of CH3COOH has been neutralized to CH3COO^-.

Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.001 mol.

Total volume: 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³=0.05 L.

Concentration of CH3COO^- = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, Kb = Kw / Ka =1e-14 / 1.85e-5 =5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Let x be the [OH^-] formed.

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 because x is very small.

So, x² = Kb * 0.02 =5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5)=4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have equivalence point near 9.02. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none match. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration calculation. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M. Then, Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = (x)(x)/(0.02 -x) ≈ x²/0.02.

x²= 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 →x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5.

[OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But the options don't have anything near 9.02. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point's volume. Let me re-calculate the moles.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L=0.001 mol. Correct.

NaOH at equivalence: 0.1 M * V =0.001 mol → V=0.01 L=10 cm³. So adding 10 cm³ to initial 40 cm³ gives 50 cm³ total volume.

So, acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the Kb calculation more accurately.

Kb= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)=5.405405e-10.

So, Kb=5.405405e-10.

x^2 =5.405405e-10 *0.02 =1.081081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so log(1.04e-5)= -5 +0.017= -4.983. So pOH=4.983 → pH=9.017.

So pH is approximately 9.02, which is about 9.02. But looking at the options, none have this. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the initial mistake was in the dilution calculation. Let me double-check that.

Original problem: Dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: M1V1 = M2V2 → (0.05)(20) = M2(40) → M2= (0.05*20)/40 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So initial moles is 0.025 M *0.04 L =0.001 mol. Correct.

So, back to the equivalence point. The pH is around 9.02, but none of the options have that. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the acetate ion concentration is not the only factor. Alternatively, maybe the mistake is in the dilution step.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck all steps.

Wait, another thought: when you dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.05 * (20/40)=0.025 M, correct.

At equivalence point, moles of acetate is 0.001 mol, volume is 50 cm³, so 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

Concentration of OH-: sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pH is 9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. So perhaps I messed up something else.

Wait, wait. Let me check the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach again for the 25% titration.

Wait, when 25% of the NaOH is added, which is 2.5 cm³, as we calculated earlier.

So, moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L=0.00025 mol.

So, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075/0.0425=approx 0.017647 M.

[A^-]=0.00025/0.0425= approx 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882/0.017647 ≈0.3333.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3)=4.73 -0.477≈4.25.

Which corresponds to option A's first value (4.26), but the equivalence point is 9.02, which none of the options have. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem considers the dilution and the titration without considering the initial dilution correctly. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, perhaps the initial volume after dilution is 40 mL, but when titrating, the endpoint is 25% of the way to equivalence. But perhaps I should consider the total volume including the NaOH added.

Wait, wait. Let me think about another approach for the equivalence point. Maybe I should compute the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The formula is pH = ½ (pKa + pKw). Because the solution is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so pH = pKa + ½ (pKw - pKa) )? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, pH = pKa + ½ (pKw - pKa), which would be pKa + ½ (14 - pKa) = 7 + ½ (pKa - 14). Hmm, not sure.

Another approach: for a weak acid salt, the pH can be calculated as sqrt(Kb * C). But wait, that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should find out what's the correct answer from the options and see where I went wrong.

Looking at the options, the only one that has pH around 4.25 is option A and D. Option A's first value is 4.26, which matches our 25% calculation.

Now, the equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which is lower than what I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the acetate concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact equations without approximation.

At equivalence point, for acetate:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The exact expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-} ]

Let me let x = [OH^-].

So, [CH3COOH] = x.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, Kb = x² / 0.02 =5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the dilution is with 20 cm³ of water, but perhaps I should consider the initial concentrations differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact solution without approximations for the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to use the formula pH = ½ (pKa + pKw) when dealing with salts of weak acids and strong bases because the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

But wait, pKa + pKw = pKa +14. So pH=½ (pKa +14).

pKa is about 4.73, so 4.73+14=18.73 → ½ is 9.365. Which is a bit higher than our calculated 9.02.

Hmm, but that's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the solution as a buffer, but equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's not a buffer anymore.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recompute everything once more.

Problem steps:

1. 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → moles =0.05 * 0.02=0.001 mol.

2. Diluted with 20 cm³ water → total volume 40 cm³ → concentration 0.001/0.04=0.025 M.

3. Titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH =0.001 mol → volume=0.001 /0.1=0.01 L=10 cm³.

4. At 25% titration: 0.00025 mol NaOH added.

So, at 25% titration, [HA]=0.00075/0.0425=0.017647 M, [A^-]=0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M.

pH=4.73 + log(0.005882/0.017647)=4.73 + log(1/3)=4.73-0.477=4.25.

Which matches option A's first value.

At equivalence, solution is 0.02 M acetate. So Kb=5.405e-10.

x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 →x=1.04e-5 →pOH=4.98 →pH=9.02.

But options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial dilution step. Let me recheck.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem says 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is DILUTED with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.05 * (20/40)=0.025 M, correct.

Another thought: perhaps the initial solution is 0.025 M, and the volume is 40 cm³. When titrating, perhaps the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added, as earlier. So the total volume is 50 cm³.

Wait, but the problem is, the equivalence pH is not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH at equivalence using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me use more precise numbers.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kw=1e-14 → so Kb= 1e-14/1.85e-5 =5.405405405e-10.

C=0.02 M.

So, C*Kb =0.02 *5.405405e-10=1.081081e-11.

So, sqrt(1.081081e-11) =1.04e-5.

So, [OH-]=1.04e-5. pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be; perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is acidic. That can't be right. Option A's equivalence is 8.52, which is lower than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me try to compute the exact pH for equivalence point.

The hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-} ].

Let x = [OH^-].

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-} ] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, Kb ≈ x² /0.02 =5.405e-10 → x²= 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

pH=14 - pOH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the solution, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C, which is standard. So the pH should indeed be around 9.02.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial acetic acid volume is 20.00 cm³, but the dilution is with 20.00 cm³ of NaOH? No, the problem says it's diluted with water.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial steps again. Maybe I should calculate the pH at 25% titration correctly.

Wait, here's another approach: instead of using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact concentrations.

At 25% titration, after adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH:

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025=0.00025 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH initially:0.001 mol. So remaining CH3COOH: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-:0.00025 mol.

Total volume:40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So, concentrations:

[CH3COOH]=0.00075/0.0425≈0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M.

So, using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH= pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])=4.73 + log(0.005882/0.017647)=4.73 + log(1/3)=4.73 -0.477=4.253.

Which is approximately 4.25. So this part is correct.

Now, looking at the options, option A's first value is 4.26; very close. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial solution is not 0.025 M but 0.0125 M. Let me check that again.

Wait, original problem: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20 cm³ water. So, total volume 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M * 20 cm³) /40 cm³ =0.025 M. Yes, correct. So initial moles are 0.025 M *0.04 L=0.001 mol.

Hm, maybe I should recompute the equivalence point using a more precise method.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't as straightforward because the initial solution is not a strong acid, so the pH calculation might involve more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the buffer equation and the assumption that [H+] is sqrt(Ka * C), but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is not taking into account the dilution correctly. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the 25% titration refers to the volume of NaOH added being 25% of the equivalence point volume. So, if the equivalence point is at 10 cm³, then 25% is 2.5 cm³, which is what I used.

But perhaps the problem refers to 25% of the initial volume of the acetic acid solution. That would be 25% of 20 cm³, which is 5 cm³. But that's unlikely because the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, which would require knowing the molarity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering 25% of the equivalence moles, which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the Kb calculation again.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) *1e-9 →1.081e-9? No, because 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 1/(1.85) *1e-9 =0.5405e-9=5.405e-10. Correct.

So, perhaps the problem isn't in the calculations. If none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer isn't among them. But that's unlikely, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem says 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is DILUTED with 20 cm³ of NaOH? No, the problem says water.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the solution is diluted with 20 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. No, the problem says water.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution after dilution is 40 cm³, and when titrated, the equivalence volume is lower. No, because moles of acetic acid are fixed.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct pH at 25% is approximately 4.25 (option A) and equivalence point is around 9.02, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial mistake was in the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M, and when it's titrated, at 25% titration, that is, after adding 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence.

But wait, perhaps the 25% is of the initial concentration, not of the moles. No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the pH at 25% of the equivalence point in terms of the volume added, not moles.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH at 25% of the equivalence point by volume, not by moles. Let's see.

At equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is needed. So 25% by volume is 2.5 cm³, which is what I did earlier.

So, perhaps I should proceed with the initial calculation, accepting that the equivalence point pH isn't among the options, but perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

So, the only option where pH at 25% is around 4.25 is option A.

But the equivalence pH in option A is 8.52, which is much lower than our calculated 9.02. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the pH at equivalence to be around 8.52. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the solution is not 0.02 M acetate but a different concentration. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include the autoionization of water or some other factor, but that's unlikely to change the pH by much.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the moles of NaOH added at equivalence.

Wait, no, the moles are correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the student to ignore the dilution and treat the initial solution as 0.05 M, but that would be a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering that the solution after dilution is a buffer. But no, at equivalence, it's a salt solution.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after dilution, the solution is 0.025 M, and the pH is calculated using the formula for a weak acid.

But no, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's a salt solution.

Hmm, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the Ka value at 25°C, which it is, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of the pH at equivalence point again using the exact quadratic formula.

So, Kb=5.405e-10.

Concentration of acetate:0.02 M.

The equation is:

x² = Kb * C → x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

pH=14 -4.98=9.02.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximation where pH = ½ (pKa + pKw), which would give pH=½(4.73 +14)=9.365. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration is 0.02 M, and the pH is determined by the formula:

pH= pKa + log ( (C)/(√(Kw)) )

But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the pH to be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + log ( (Kw)/(C) )^(1/2)

Wait, that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the simplified formula pH = pKa + ½ (pKw - pKa), which would be pH=4.73 + ½ (14-4.73)=4.73 + 4.635=9.365.

But that still doesn't match any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here, but given the options, the only one matching the 25% pH is option A. So perhaps the equivalence point in option A is incorrect, but the 25% is correct, and I should choose option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the dilution of acetic acid. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula:

\[
M_1V_1 = M_2V_2
\]

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.0125 \, \text{M}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.0125 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.0005 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.0005 = 0.000125 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.0005 - 0.000125 = 0.000375 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forming:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.000125 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 1.25 \, \text{cm}^3 = 41.25 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04125 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.000375}{0.04125} = 0.00909 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.000125}{0.04125} = 0.00303 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00303}{0.00909} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

This matches the first value in **Option A**.

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.0005 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.0005}{0.05} = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
\]

The solution is basic due to the hydrolysis of acetate ions:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.01}.
\]

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.01 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.01 = 5.405 \times 10^{-12}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{5.405 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 2.325 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(2.325 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.63.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.63 = 8.37.
\]

This does not match any of the options provided. However, the closest match for the pH at 25% titration is **Option A**.

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the equivalence point pH is not listed among the options. Based on the given choices, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
