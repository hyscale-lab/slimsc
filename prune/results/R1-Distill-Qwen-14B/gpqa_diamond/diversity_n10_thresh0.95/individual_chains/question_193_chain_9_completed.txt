Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I think I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa.

Wait, the formula given is N ∝ 1 / plx^5. But since plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So plx = 1/(distance in parsecs, I think). So if plx is 1/d, then 1/plx would be d. So let me substitute that into the equation.

N ∝ 1 / (1/d)^5. Because plx is 1/d, so 1/(plx^5) is 1/((1/d)^5) which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, the number per unit distance. So maybe I need to find the derivative, like the rate of change of N with respect to d.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region as a function of parallax is given by N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. But wait, number of stars as a function of d would be N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But the question is asking how the number changes with distance, per unit range. That probably means the change in N as d increases by a unit amount. So maybe the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dd is the derivative of k d^5, which is 5k d^4. So the rate of change of N with d is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but the options are in terms of r, which I think is the same as d in this context. So the change per unit distance would be proportional to r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of differential. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would be proportional to d^4. So the answer would be r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. But plx is 1/d, so N ∝ d^5. But when considering the number per unit distance, perhaps I need to think about how many stars are in a thin shell between d and d+Δd. The number of stars in that shell would be the difference in N between those two distances. So if N(d) = k d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell is approximately dN = k (d+Δd)^5 - k d^5 ≈ k * 5 d^4 Δd. So the number per unit distance (dN/dΔd) is 5k d^4, which is proportional to d^4. So yes, the rate is proportional to r^4, so option C is correct.


The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), where parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)) in parsecs: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) into the equation, we find \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \): 

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto d^4.
\]

This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( d^4 \), or equivalently \( r^4 \) (where \( r \) represents distance). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \): Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \): Incorrect, as \( r^5 \) describes the total number of stars, not the rate of change.**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \): Correct, as the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \): Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^2 \).**

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance increases with \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
