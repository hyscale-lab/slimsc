Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since the compound is reacting with HI and phosphorus, which are typical for elimination reactions, maybe it's an alcohol or something with acidic protons, like a carboxylic acid. Wait, the second big peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound might have a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ could be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe it's an aromatic compound with a carbonyl substituent.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for one proton. That's a strong downfield shift, which suggests an aldehyde proton (but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet) or maybe a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, the 10.5 ppm is more likely a carboxylic acid because aldehydes are a bit lower. But wait, the IR had 1720, which is a carbonyl. Carboxylic acids have O-H in IR too, which we do have in the 3400 region. So maybe it's a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Since the peaks are doublets, they might be two sets of protons, each as doublets. So for example, if there's substituent on the benzene, perhaps at the para position, leading to two sets of two equivalent protons each. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with another group attached.

The next peak is 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet, probably some kind of methylene or methine group. Maybe a CH next to an oxygen or another substituent. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a -CH₂- group, perhaps adjacent to something else. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of three protons as a doublet, which suggests a CH₂-CH(CH3) structure. So maybe a branching there. And finally, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like a CH₂CH₂CH3 or similar.

Putting this together, maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that's a carboxylic acid group (from the IR and NMR), and also a substituent that's some kind of branched alkyl chain. Wait, but the IR also has a carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that would make sense because carboxylic acids have both O-H (IR 3400-2500 and 1720 cm⁻¹ for the C=O).

Wait, but the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which would fit a carboxylic acid. The IR has 3400-2500, which could be the O-H stretch for the carboxylic acid. So that makes me think that the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So the structure might be something like para-substituted benzoic acid with an ethyl or other group attached. But how does the NMR fit? The 10.5 ppm is the -COOH proton. Then the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which fit a para-substituted pattern. The substituent on the benzene is another group, perhaps a branched alkyl chain.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H). Let's see. The 0.9 triplet suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain. The 1.4 doublet (3H) is a CH₂ group where the other two H are on a adjacent CH. Wait, perhaps it's a (CH₂)CH(CH3) group or something like that. The 2.9 ppm is a methine (CH) attached to something, maybe an oxygen or another group.

Wait, putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group but with a branch. Let's say the substituent is (CH₂)CH(CH3)₂? Or maybe a propyl group with branching. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group. Let me think about the integration.

The 1H NMR has 1 (the -COOH), 2 (each aromatic), 2, 2, 3, 3. So the substituent must have a total of 1+2+3=6 protons? Wait, let's count: 1 (COOH), 2 (each aromatic), 2 (CH₂), 3 (CH3), and 3 (CH3). Wait, maybe it's a -CH₂-CH(CH₂CH2CH3) group? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, think about the substituent on the benzene. The substituent is attached in the para position. Let's say the substituent is a propanoic acid group. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, which could be the acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester? But the IR has O-H as well, which would be more consistent with an acid than an ester.

Wait another thought: the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H signals, but in NMR, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, and it's a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. So that makes sense. So, the structure would have a benzene ring with a -COOH group and another substituent.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which would be consistent with para substitution. For example, if the substituent is a -COOH (para) and another group, but wait, that might complicate the aromatic protons. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group at position 4, and another substituent at position 1. Or perhaps it's a single substituent that's a benzoyl group with another substituent. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group that's part of an ester or acid. Let's think about the reaction. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus with HI is a reagent used for the substitution of oxygen with iodine, especially in the presence of H2O or other substituents. Wait, but more commonly, red phosphorus and HI are used for the conversion of alcohols to iodides via the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction? No, wait, I think that's for ketones. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI is a reagent used for the substitution of hydroxyl groups (like in alcohols) to iodide. So if the starting material has an -OH group, like a primary or secondary alcohol, it would be converted to an iodide. But in this case, the IR shows a carbonyl group and O-H, which suggests maybe a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps a substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the starting compound is a benzyl alcohol derivative. No, wait the IR has a carbonyl. Let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So let's look at these options.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be a benzene ring with ethyl group at para, and a propanoic acid group attached. Wait, that would be a substituent in the ortho position of the propanoic acid? Or maybe the substituents are on the benzene ring. Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the benzene ring attached to the second carbon of the propanoic acid. But that's not possible because propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the substituent would be on the middle carbon. Hmm, not sure.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. Let's think about the NMR.

Benzoic acid has a -COOH group, which would have a proton around 10.5 ppm. The aromatic protons would be at lower ppm if there's an electron-withdrawing group like -COOH. So the para substitution would lead to two doublets in the aromatic region. The substituents on the benzene are -COOH (para) and a sec-butyl group (also para? No, wait, 4-(sec-butyl) would be attached at the para position relative to the COOH. So the benzene would have COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4? No, wait, in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. So 4-(sec-butyl) would be in the para position relative to COOH, making the substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). Wait, but that would make the substituents meta to each other, not para. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, the benzene ring has COOH at position 4 and the substituent at position 1? No, perhaps I should draw it.

Benzoic acid is usually numbered so that the COOH is at position 1. So 4-(sec-butyl) would be at position 4, which is para to position 1. So the substituents would be on positions 1 and 4? Or wait, perhaps the substituent is only at position 4. Wait, no, the name is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would imply that the benzoic acid is in position 1, and the substituent is at position 4. So the substituents are para to each other.

But wait, in that case, the aromatic protons would all be in certain regions. The substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl) would influence the aromatic protons. The COOH is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which would deactivate the ring and cause the neighboring protons to be deshielded, appearing downfield. The sec-butyl group is an electron-donating group, which would cause the adjacent protons to be upfield.

So the aromatic region would have two doublets: one from the protons ortho to the COOH (more downfield) and one from the protons ortho to the sec-butyl (more upfield). But in the given NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which are both in the range for a para-substituted benzene with strong substituents.

Wait, but if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a bulky group, maybe the ring is meta to the substituent. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 2 or 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the adjacent position. Let's think about the NMR of the substituent.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be -CH2-C(CH3)2. Wait, no, sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃). No, wait, no. Wait, butyl groups: primary is -CH₂CH₂CH₂CH3. Secondary is -CH₂CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is: CH₂CH₂CH(CH3). No, wait, the correct structure is: the secondary butyl group is -CH₂CH(CH₂CH3). No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: butyl groups are four carbons. The secondary butyl group is a -CH₂CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, that would be a tertiary group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait, the structure of sec-butyl group is actually: -CH₂CH(CH₂CH3). No, that's not right. Let me think again. The butyl group has four carbons. The primary is -CH₂CH₂CH₂CH3. The secondary is -CH₂CH(CH3)₂. No, wait, no. Wait, the correct structure of a secondary butyl group is -CH₂CH(CH₂CH3), but that can't be because that's a five-carbon chain. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of substituents. The substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be:

COOH is attached to the benzene at position 1. The substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the substituent is at the para position relative to the COOH. So the substituent is -CH₂CH(CH₂CH3), perhaps? Or is it -CH(CH₂CH3)CH₂?

Wait, no. The structure of a sec-butyl group is: CH₂CH₂CH(CH3), but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The secondary butyl group is actually -CH₂CH(CH₂CH3), but that's a four-carbon chain where the branching is on the second carbon. So the substituent would be -CH₂CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that would be a propyl group with a methyl branch. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think more about the NMR.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group on position 4. The substituent would have a structure like -CH₂CH(CH₂CH3). Wait, no, that would make the substituent a pentyl group. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the NMR of the substituent: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH next to the benzene. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group adjacent to a CH₂, perhaps in a branching. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

So the substituent seems to have a structure like -CH₂-CH(CH₂CH3). But wait, that would be a butyl group. Let me try to map the NMR:

The 0.9 ppm t (3H) indicates a CH2CH3 group at the end of a chain. The 1.4 ppm d (3H) would be a CH2 connected to a CH. The 1.7 ppm m (2H) would be the two Hs on the CH2 next to the CH. The 2.9 ppm m (1H) would be the CH group attached to the benzene.

So the structure is: benzene ring with COOH at position 1, and a substituent at position 4 which is a CH₂-CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, that would be a secondary butyl group (sec-butyl). So the substituent is -CH₂-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that would imply the substituent is a secondary group, so the structure is correct.

So going back to the NMR, the substituent's protons would be as follows:

The CH₂ next to the benzene (let's say it's the CH₂ connected to the CH) would have two protons, appearing as a multiplet around 1.7 ppm. The CH itself would have one proton as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm. Then, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group (CH3) attached, which would show up as a doublet (since it's attached to a CH that's next to a CH2), at 1.4 ppm. The terminal CH2CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

So the substituent is a -CH₂-CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl.

So the initial compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure is a benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 1 and a -CH₂CH(CH2CH3) group at position 4.

Now, the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does that do? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrohalogenation of alcohols. Wait, wait, when you have an alcohol and treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it can convert the alcohol to an iodide. For example, in the presence of H2O, red phosphorus and HI can act as a dehydrating agent to convert an alcohol to an iodide via substitution.

But wait, the starting compound is a benzoic acid. Does it have an alcohol group? The IR shows O-H, but in benzoic acid, the O-H is the carboxylic acid, not an alcohol. So unless the substituent has an alcohol group, which I don't think it does.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's re-examine the NMR again. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, likely the -COOH proton. But the substituent's protons are as we discussed before. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, when treated with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used for the substitution of hydroxyl groups. But the starting material is a benzoic acid, which doesn't have an OH group in a position that's reactive towards substitution. Unless there's an alcohol somewhere else in the molecule.

Wait, but the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Does that have any OH groups? No, it's an alkyl group. So perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into something else. Oh, wait! Maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. But I'm not sure how red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by iodide. But that seems unlikely because -COOH is a strong acid and substitution would require a good leaving group, which it isn't.

Wait, I might be getting the reaction wrong. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of alcohols to convert them to iodides. For example, in the case of secondary alcohols, they can be converted to iodides, which are good leaving groups.

So if the starting material has an alcohol group, then the reaction would produce an iodide. But in the given compound, the only O-H is the carboxylic acid. So unless the substituent has another O-H group, which I don't think it does.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial identification of the substituent. Let me go back to the NMR data. The substituent's protons are 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H). That suggests a chain like CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like an isopropyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me think about the substituent's structure.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, so that's at the end of a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So the substituent is a CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)- group? Let me see:

-CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)- would mean the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would make it a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), which matches the NMR and IR data.

Now, the reaction: when benzoic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, but benzoic acid doesn't have an alcohol group. Hmm. So maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Because if the compound doesn't have an alcohol, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus wouldn't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, but the IR shows a strong O-H, which would make it a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl alcohol group. But where would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ether or something else. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an alcohol. Let's see. The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be a phenolic O-H, but then the IR would have different peaks. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has an alcohol group.

Wait, if the substituent is an -OCH2CH2CH3 group, but that would show up as a singlet in the NMR, not as a multiplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2OH group. But then the O-H would be in the NMR as a broad peak, but the given NMR doesn't show that. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a secondary alcohol.

Wait, let me think again: the substituent's NMR peaks are 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). So it's a four-carbon substituent. Let's see: the 0.9 is a terminal methyl (CH2CH2CH2CH3?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. But that would have a different NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, another approach: The substituent has a CH₂ group next to a CH, which is next to a CH₂, which is next to a CH3. So the structure is CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that seems too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which typically converts alcohols to iodides. So if the starting material has an alcoholic (OH) group, it would be replaced by I.

But the initial compound's IR and NMR don't indicate an alcoholic OH. The IR has a broad O-H, which could be a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The NMR peak at 10.5 is more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Maybe the substituent is an alkoxy group. But the IR doesn't show strong absorption for ethers, which is usually around 1100-1
