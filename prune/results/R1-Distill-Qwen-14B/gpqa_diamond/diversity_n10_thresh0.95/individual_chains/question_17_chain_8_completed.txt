Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The question says there's a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA. The formula for EDTA is usually something like Y^4-, right? So calcium, which has a +2 charge, would combine with EDTA to form a complex. The stoichiometric ratio would be 1:1, so each Ca^2+ binds with one EDTA^4- ion.

Wait, but wait. The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M.

I think the dissociation of the complex would be something like: CaY^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. But wait, no, actually, the complex is formed by Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- combining. So the formation equation is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-.

But in this problem, the solution is already the complex, so we can model the dissociation. The K for the complex dissociation is given as KCa-EDTA =5e10. So K is the formation constant, which is the reciprocal of the dissociation constant. Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). So the given K is Kf =5e10.

But in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. We can consider that the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So, let me set up the expression. Let me denote [Ca^2+] as x. Then, [EDTA^4-] would also be x, assuming that all the EDTA is in this form. Wait, but wait. Because the EDTA could be from other sources, but in this case, the only source is the dissociation of the complex. So initially, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA] are zero. But as it dissociates, let me say it dissociates to x of each.

So, at equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But wait, x is going to be very small compared to 0.02 because K is large (5e10). So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M.

So, the Kf expression would be:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])

Which becomes:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) 

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x: x² = 0.02 / (5e10)

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because 6.5*2 is 13. So, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. But 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, approximately. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * (3.16e-7), which is about 6.32e-7 M. That's the concentration of Ca^2+.

So the concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking back at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I get the K right? Because sometimes I get confused between Kf and the dissociation K.

Wait, formation constant Kf is the equilibrium for the formation of the complex. So, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) =5e10.

So if the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] is approx 0.02, [Ca^2+] =x, [EDTA^4-]=x.

So Kf = 0.02/(x^2)=5e10 → x^2=0.02/(5e10) → x²=2e-2/5e10= (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → x= sqrt(4e-13) → same as before, approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \)). Let the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \( x \). Using the equilibrium expression for \( K_f \):

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
