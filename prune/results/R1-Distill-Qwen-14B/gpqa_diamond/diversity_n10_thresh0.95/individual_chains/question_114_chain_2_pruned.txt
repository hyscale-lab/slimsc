Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions, and I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

First, let's read the reactions carefully. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction uses that product, along with reagent B (H2O), to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Wait, no, the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → something. The second reaction is the product of the first plus B (and H2O?) forming another compound.

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me look again. The second reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Oh, okay, so in the second step, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

So, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, so butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. So this looks like a nucleophilic addition to a ketone. 

Wait, but wait. Normally, when you have a ketone reacting with CN- (from NaCN), under certain conditions, it undergoes a nucleophilic addition. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write down the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with CN-, the cyanide would add to the carbonyl carbon, right? So the initial product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN would make (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile? Let me count the carbons. Wait, butan-2-one is four carbons: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-? Wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So adding cyanide would give (CH3)2C(O^-)CN; but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: the product structure is CH(CH2CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would be:

The structure would be: 

The main chain is four carbons. The nitrile group is on the second carbon. So:

CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but in this case, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the second carbon has a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and a nitrile group.

Wait, so structure is:

CH2–C(OH)(CN)(CH3). So that would be a four-carbon chain where the second carbon has OH, CN, and a methyl. So the formula would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

So this is the product of the addition of CN- to acetone (butan-2-one). So in the presence of reagent A, which is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So the reaction is the addition of cyanide to the ketone. But for this addition
