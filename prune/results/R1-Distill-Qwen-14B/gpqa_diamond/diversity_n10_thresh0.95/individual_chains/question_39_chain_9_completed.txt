Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me see. The question is about wave functions and normalization, I think. So, let me read it again carefully.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. Each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measure the position, they only find the particles between x=1 and x=3. The task is to find the value of a.

Wait, the wave function is a complex function here. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, and the probability density is the square of the absolute value. So I need to normalize this wave function so that the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 equals 1. Because that's how probabilities work in QM—the total probability must be 1.

So the given wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that down. So ψ(x) has a real part a/sqrt(1+x) and an imaginary part -0.5i. Wait, so the imaginary part is a constant, not depending on x? That's interesting. So the wave function is a sum of a real term (which depends on x) and a constant imaginary term.

To find the normalization, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3, and set it equal to 1.

The absolute square of ψ(x) is [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]². So Re(ψ) is a/sqrt(1 + x), and Im(ψ) is -0.5. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

Let me split this integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx + Integral [0.25] dx, both from 1 to 3.

The first integral: a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|, right? So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So adding both parts together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Because the total integral must be 1 for normalization. So solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is the square root of 0.7213. Let me calculate that. The square root of 0.72 is about 0.8485. Hmm, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.7213: sqrt(0.7213). Let me think. 0.85 squared is 0.7225. Oh, because 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225. But wait, our a² is approximately 0.7213, which is just a bit less than 0.7225. So a would be just a little less than 0.85, perhaps around 0.849 or something.

Looking at the options: option B is 0.85, option C is 0.35. Hmm, wait, but wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Because wait, let me recheck.

Wait, the integral is from x=1 to x=3.

So the first integral: [a² (ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3. So ln(4) - ln(2) is ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that part is correct.

Second integral: 0.25*(3 - 1) is 0.5. Correct.

Then, a² ln 2 + 0.5 = 1 → a² = 0.5 / ln 2.

Compute 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.721347.

So a² ≈ 0.721347 → a ≈ sqrt(0.721347) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, but 0.849 is very close to 0.85. So the correct value of a is approximately 0.85. Therefore, option B is the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a function of x, but the imaginary part is a constant. That's a bit unusual. So when I took the absolute squared, I correctly added the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So yes, that part was correct. So the calculation should be accurate. So a is approximately 0.849, so option B, 0.85 is the correct answer.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \text{Re}(\psi(x))^2 + \text{Im}(\psi(x))^2 \). Substituting the real and imaginary parts:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \): The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \): The integral of the constant \( 0.25 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is very close to 0.85. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
