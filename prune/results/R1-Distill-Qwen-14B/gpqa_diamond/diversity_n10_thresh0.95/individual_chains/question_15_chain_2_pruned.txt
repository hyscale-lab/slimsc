Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 orbits much faster. Oh wait, but the host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting.

The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. So, the probability of a transit depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability (p) of a planet transiting its star is related to the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I think is p ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (something with the orbital period and the star's radius?), but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability can be calculated as p ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * (1/(1 + (M_star/m_planet)^(1/3))) or something like that, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more edge-on. The chance of that happening is higher for planets with shorter orbital periods, perhaps?

Wait no, maybe that's not right. Let me think again. Oh, wait. The probability of a transit is given by the formula p = (R_p + R_s) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because R_p is much smaller than R_s, and a is in astronomical units. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) squared multiplied by (1/(1 + (M_star / m_planet)^(1/3)))). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, no. Another approach: the probability of a planet transiting is given by the ratio of the size of the star (as seen from Earth) compared to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, I think it's more about the size of the star's disk relative to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is p = (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, that would be the area. Because when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on, the chance of the planet passing in front of the star is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. So, maybe p ≈ (R_star / a) * something else.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to model the orbital inclination. The probability of the planet's orbit being aligned such that it transits is 1/(1+ (a/(R_star))² )^(1/2) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the probability is approximately (R_p + R_s) / (a * sin i), but that's getting complicated.

Wait, I've read before that the transit probability can be approximated as p = (R_p / R_s)^2 / ( (a/(R_s))^2 + 1 )^(3/2) ), but that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, another source says that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (a/R_s)^2 )) ). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should approach this more methodically. The transit probability depends on two main factors: the size of the planet relative to the star (because the planet has to block enough starlight for us to notice) and the alignment of the orbit (so the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view).

The probability is highest when the planet's orbit is edge-on. The probability of that is (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, that's the area of the circle (from Earth's perspective) that the planet can block. The chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned so that it transits would be based on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Wait, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is p = (R_s) / (a) * something. Oh, wait, I think the correct formula is p = (R_s + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately R_s / a.

Wait no, that would be the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. But wait, if a is much larger than R_s, which it is, then R_s / a is a small number, which makes sense because the probability of transit is low.

Wait, I think a better way is to model the probability as follows. For a circular orbit, the probability that the planet transits is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So p = (R_s) / (a) multiplied by some factor. Wait, no. Let me think geometrically. Imagine a sphere (the star) and a planet orbiting it. The area where the planet can be in front of the star (from Earth's point of view) is a circle on the star's disk. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it passes through that circle is proportional to the area of the circle divided by the area of the planet's orbit's cross-section.

Wait, the cross-sectional area of the planet's orbit is π a². The area where a transit can occur is π (R_s + R_p)^2, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately π R_s². So the probability is (π R_s²) / (π a²) ) = (R_s / a )^2. Wait, so p ≈ (R_s / a )².

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because for closer planets, a is smaller, so R_s/a is larger, meaning higher probability. That makes sense because closer planets have a higher chance of transiting because their orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on.

But wait, in reality, the probability of transit is not that straightforward. I think the actual formula is p = (R_p + R_s) / a * (1 / sqrt(1 + (a/(R_s + R_p))^2 )) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be confusing this with other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is given by p ≈ (R_s / a) * ( (R_s + R_p) / a ). Wait, not sure. Let's look for another approach.

Another way to think about it: the transit probability depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance. For a planet to transit, the planet must pass in front of the star. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on. The RV method tells us the minimum mass, but not the inclination, so for RV planets, the transit probability can be higher because we know the mass, but I think the transit probability is independent of the mass, depends on the orbital geometry.

Wait, the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but if the planet is more massive, does that affect the transit probability? Not directly, because the transit depends on the size, not the mass. Unless the mass relates to the radius. Wait, but the question says both planets have the same mass, so their radii might be similar (assuming same density, but Earth-like, so same radius probably?).

So, considering both planets have the same mass (and Earth-like, so similar radii), then R_p1 ≈ R_p2. So, the radii of the planets don't change the outcome as much as the star's radius and the planet's semi-major axis.

The probability of transit is higher when the semi-major axis is smaller (closer in). Because a smaller a means the planet is more likely to pass in front of the star from our view.

So, for a given star, p is proportional to R_s^2 / a^2. But wait, R_s is the radius of the host star.

Wait, the formula I think is p = (R_p + R_s) / (a) * [ 1 / (1 + (a/(R_s + R_p))^2 ) ]^(1/2) ) ].

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is approximately (R_s / a)². Because that's the square of the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's distance, which makes sense dimensionally.

So if p ∝ (R_s / a)^2, then we can compute p for each planet.

Now, let's compute a for each planet using Kepler's third law. The period P is given, and knowing the mass of the star, we can find a.

Kepler's third law: (P² G (M_star + m_planet)) ) / (4 π²) ) = a³. Since m_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_total ≈ M_star.

So a³ = [ G M_star P² ] / (4 π² )

But since both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods and different host stars, we can find a for each.

Let me compute a₁ and a₂, the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2.

Given:

- Planet_1 has P₁ = P (since it's three times shorter than Planet_2's period. Wait, no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P₁ = P_2 / 3.

Wait, the question says: "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So, P₁ = (1/3) P₂.

Both have same masses (m_p1 = m_p2), but their host stars have different masses.

Star_1 (host of Planet_1) has M₁ = 2 M₂, where M₂ is the mass of Star_2. And both stars have same radius: R₁ = R₂ = R.

We can compute a₁ and a₂.

Kepler's law: a³ = [ G M_star P² ] / (4 π² )

So,

a₁³ = [ G (2 M₂) (P₁)² ] / (4 π² )

a₂³ = [ G (M₂) (P₂)² ] / (4 π² )

But since P
