Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view here on Earth. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability, so I need to figure out which planet that is.

Let me try to break down the information given. Both planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. That means their minimum masses are known, along with their orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits, which might simplify the calculations a bit.

The stars they orbit are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. I remember that for stars, mass and radius aren't always directly proportional because of different evolutionary stages. Since Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, maybe it's a subgiant or something, but the radii are the same as Planet_1's star. So Star_1 (Planet_1's host) is more massive than Star_2 (Planet_2's host), but same radius.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The key factors are the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The probability is higher when the orbit is edge-on, which gives a higher chance of the planet passing in front of the star. But how do other factors like orbital distance come into play?

I think the transit probability (P) is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something related to the orbital inclination. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the size of the star and the size of the orbit. Let me recall the formula for transit probability.

Oh right, the geometric probability of a transit is given by (R_p / a)^2 * (something else?), or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/(a/R_s)), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) multiplied by some function of the orbital period. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula.

Wait, I remember that the transit probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The key factors are:

1. The ratio of the planet's size to the star's size (since a larger planet or a smaller star increases the chance of a transit being detected).
2. The orbital distance (a) because the planet needs to pass in front of the star from our perspective. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to be aligned edge-on. But how does that depend on the orbital period?

Wait, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, because the area the planet needs to cover is a small part of the star's disk as seen from Earth.

Actually, I think the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) ), but wait, that doesn't make dimensional sense. Let me think again. 

Another approach: The transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can transit (a small circle) to the total area of the star. Wait, no, I think it's more about the relative size of the planet's orbit. 

Wait, I think the geometric probability P is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) )

No, that doesn't seem right
