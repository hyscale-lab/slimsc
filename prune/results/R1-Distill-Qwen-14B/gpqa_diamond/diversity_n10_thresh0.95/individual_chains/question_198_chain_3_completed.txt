Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in the solution.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants are involved in complex formation. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the complexes with higher β values will form more.

Wait, what's the structure here? Co(II) can form complexes with SCN-. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. The first complex would be [CoSCN]^+, then [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on. The β values represent the formation constants for each step. So β1 is the formation of the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

The problem is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So that's the third species, I guess. Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The complexes are:

1. Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (β1=9)
2. [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40)
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (β4=16)

Wait, no, the charges must add up. Let me check:

Co^2+ is +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So:

[CoSCN]^+ → Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is +2 + (-1) = +1. Correct.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 → Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → +2 -2 = 0. Right.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- → +2 -3 = -1.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- → +2 -4 = -2. Yep.

So the complex we're interested in is the dithiocyanato, which is the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Wait no, the question says the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, maybe the dithiocyanato is the one with two SCN- ligands, so that's the second complex. But wait, the options are percentage of all cobalt species, including all possible complexes.

So the approach is to find the fraction of each possible complex and sum them up. The dithiocyanato is the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, so its fraction is whatever comes from β2 and the others.

Wait, but I think the way to calculate this is to consider each complex's concentration relative to each other, using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

Each step, the formation of the next complex depends on the previous one. So the overall approach is to calculate the concentration of each complex, considering the stepwise formation.

So, the general approach is to model the system using the stability constants. The total concentration of all cobalt species is the sum of [Co^2+], [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But calculating each concentration might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate using the formation constants and the concentrations.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each complex can be found using the stepwise formation constants, and the total concentration can be found by summing all the fractions.

Wait, I remember that the fraction of each species can be determined using the log of the product of the β values up to that point, divided by the sum of all such terms. Let me think.

The general formula for the fraction of a complex in solution is given by:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n / (denominator terms)

But the denominator includes all possible complexes, so for each species, we have the product of the formation constants up to that step, multiplied by [SCN^-]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms for all possible species.

Wait, more accurately, the fraction for each species is:

f_n = ( [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n * product_{i=1 to n} β_i ) / (sum_{k=0}^{4} [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^k product_{i=1}^k β_i )

But wait, [Co^2+] is the initial concentration. Let me think. Let me define the complexes as:

Co^2+ → species 0.

Species 1: [CoSCN]^+ → product β1.

Species 2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → product β1*β2.

Species 3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → product β1*β2*β3.

Species 4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → product β1*β2*β3*β4.

So the fraction for each species is:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... βn) [SCN]^n * C_co / (denominator)

Where denominator is sum over all species m=0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βm) [SCN]^m C_co )

Wait, but [Co^2+] is given as 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So let's plug these in.

But wait, in the denominator, each term is (β1 β2 ... βm) * [SCN]^m * C_co.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is the initial concentration, and each complex is formed by adding SCN^-.

Wait, let's think in terms of the formation of each complex. The problem is that the total concentration of Co is fixed, and the complexes are formed stepwise.

Alternatively, the fraction of each complex can be found using the following approach. The fraction f_n for each complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^n / (sum_{m=0}^4 (β1 ... βm) [SCN]^m )

Wait, but [SCN] is 0.1 M. And [Co^2+] is 1e-2 M, but perhaps it's factored out.

Wait, perhaps the fractions are based on the relative contributions of each complex, considering the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

Let me try to model this. Let me denote:

Let’s consider that the Co is in various forms: Co^2+ (n=0), [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), etc. The fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^n / (sum_{k=0}^4 (β1 β2 ... βk) [SCN]^k )

But wait, when n=0, the product is 1, since there are no β terms. So f_0 is 1 / sum.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, so n=2.

So let's compute the numerator for n=2 and the denominator.

But wait, what is the order of the β's? Because in the problem statement, the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, each β is the formation constant for the next complex. So β1 is for the first step, β2 for the second, etc.

So for each species, the product is:

n=0: 1

n=1: β1 = 9

n=2: β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360

n=3: 9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680

n=4: 22680 *16=362880.

Now, [SCN] is 0.1 M.

So for each term (n=0 to 4), the term is:

n=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1 * 1=1

n=1: 9 * (0.1)^1 = 9 * 0.1=0.9

n=2: 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6

n=3: 22680 * (0.1)^3= 22680 * 0.001=22.68

n=4: 362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 =36.288.

Now, sum all these terms to get the denominator.

Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me compute that:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the denominator is 64.468.

Now, the term for n=2 is 3.6.

So the fraction f_2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557, approximately 5.557%.

Wait, but that can't be right because one of the options is around 16.9% (option D). Hmm, but wait, this would suggest that the dithiocyanato is only about 5.5% of the total.

But wait, that doesn't align with the options. Did I mess up the calculation?

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, [SCN] is 0.1 M, so (0.1)^n.

n=0: 1

n=1: 9 * 0.1 =0.9 ✓

n=2: 9*40 =360, multiplied by (0.1)^2=0.01 →360 *0.01=3.6 ✓

n=3: 9*40*63=22680, multiplied by (0.1)^3=1e-3 → 22680 *0.001=22.68 ✓

n=4: 9*40*63*16= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880 → multiplied by (0.1)^4=1e-4 →362880 * 0.0001=36.288 ✓

Sum terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468. Correct.

So the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557, so 5.557%.

But none of the options are close to this. Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it.

The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, perhaps the blue color is from the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is the dithiocyanato, but perhaps that's not the only dithiocyanato complex. Or maybe the "blue" refers to a different complex.

Wait, no, the problem states "dithiocyanato", which means two SCN- ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex.

Hmm. So according to my calculation, it's about 5.5%. But the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. So none match. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have included the initial [Co^2+] concentration? Wait, no, because in the fraction calculation, the [Co^2+] is a common factor that would cancel out.

Wait, wait, another thought. The [Co] total is 1e-2 M, but when calculating the fractions, we're considering the distribution of the cobalt between the various species. So perhaps the fractions are calculated as (concentration of each species) divided by (total cobalt concentration).

Wait, but in the way I calculated, the [Co^2+] is 1e-2 M, but the [SCN] is 0.1 M. So maybe I should include [Co^2+] in the terms. Let me think again.

Wait, the general expression for each species is:

[CoL_n] = [Co^2+] * (β1 β2 ... βn) [L]^n / (denominator)

But the denominator is sum_{m=0}^4 [Co^2+] (β1 β2 ... βm) [L]^m.

Ah, but in that case, the denominator would be [Co^2+] multiplied by the sum of the terms I calculated earlier. So when we take the fraction [CoL_n]/[Co_total], it would be:

([CoL_n]/([Co_total])) = ([Co^2+] β1...βn [L]^n ) / ( [Co^2+] sum (β1...βm [L]^m ) )

The [Co^2+] cancels out.

So yes, the fractions are as I calculated earlier.

But according to that, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2) is 3.6 /64.468 ≈5.56%. But that's not matching any options.

Hmm. Maybe I messed up the order of the β's? Let me check the problem statement again.

The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the β's are given in the order of the complexes, but maybe the β4 is for the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. So the β values are:

K1: [CoSCN]^+ / (Co^2+ SCN^-)

K2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / ([CoSCN]^+ SCN^- )

So each subsequent β is the formation constant for adding another SCN^-.

So the product for each complex is correct as I did earlier.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the β values are the overall formation constants, not stepwise. So β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. But that's not the usual way stability constants are presented. Usually, they're given stepwise, as the formation of each successive complex.

Wait, but if the β's are not stepwise, but overall, then the approach changes. Let me think.

Assuming that βn is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, then the product for each species would be different.

Wait, for example, if β1 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+ → β1 = [CoSCN]^+/(Co^2+ SCN^-)

β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0/(Co^2+ (SCN^-)^2 )

β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^-/(Co^2+ (SCN^-)^3 )

β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-/(Co^2+ (SCN^-)^4 )

In that case, the product for each species is just βn, not the product up to n.

So for each species, the term would be:

n=0: 1

n=1: β1 * [SCN]

n=2: β2 * [SCN]^2

n=3: β3 * [SCN]^3

n=4: β4 * [SCN]^4

Wait, but that would change the calculation.

So sum =1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

But let's compute that.

Given [SCN] =0.1.

Compute each term:

n=0: 1.

n=1: β1 * 0.1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β2 * 0.1^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3 *0.1^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4 *0.1^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Now sum all these terms:

1 +0.9=1.9

+0.4=2.3

+0.063=2.363

+0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

The term for n=2 is 0.4.

So fraction f_2=0.4/2.3646 ≈0.169, or 16.9%. That's option D.

Wait, that makes sense and matches one of the options. So perhaps I misinterpreted the β's as stepwise when they were actually overall constants.

But wait, I thought β's are stepwise. Hmm. The question states, "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16."

Wait, the term 'stability constants' usually refer to the overall constants for each complex. So for each complex [Co(SCN)_n], the stability constant is the overall formation constant from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

So the calculation using the overall β's would be correct, leading to f_2≈16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier, when I treated the β's as stepwise, the fraction was about 5.5%, which didn't match any option. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat the β's as overall.

Wait, let me verify what the stability constant usually refers to. The stability constant (β) for a complex [ML_n] is defined as:

β = [ML_n]/([M][L]^n)

So each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex, meaning the product approach I used earlier is incorrect if the β's are given for each complex. So in that case, the fraction would be calculated using βn multiplied by [L]^n, for each n.

Therefore, the correct approach is the second one, where each term for species n is βn * [L]^n.

So let me recompute with that approach.

So for each species n=0 to 4:

n=0: 1

n=1: β1 * [SCN] =9 * 0.1=0.9

n=2: β2 * [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4

n=3: β3 * [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

n=4: β4 * [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all these terms:

1 +0.9=1.9

+0.4=2.3

+0.063=2.363

+0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

The term for n=2 is 0.4.

Thus, the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈0.169, or 16.9%. That's option D.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations [Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The stability constant βₙ represents the overall formation constant for the nth complex, defined as:

\[
\beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_n]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
\]

The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

For the given problem, the terms for each species are:

- \( n = 0 \): \( 1 \)
- \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

The denominator is the sum of all terms:

\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰, \( n = 2 \)) is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{(or 16.9%)}.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.

Answer: D
