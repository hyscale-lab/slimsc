Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and frequency. But wait, this is relativistic, so I think special relativity comes into play here. Let me try to think this through.

The problem says the oscillator is 1-dimensional and obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a simple harmonic oscillator but in a relativistic context. The mass is m, maximum amplitude is A. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be v_max = sqrt(k A²/m). Wait, that's option C. But since we're dealing with relativity, I can't just use that. Relativity adds a factor because as speeds get closer to c, the relativistic mass increases.

Wait, but how does that affect the oscillator? The equation of motion changes because of the relativistic mass. I think the relativistic equation for a harmonic oscillator would involve the gamma factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe the potential and kinetic energy have to be adjusted for relativistic effects.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the conservation of energy in the relativistic scenario. In the rest frame of the oscillator, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and the maximum kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. So maybe the total energy is the sum of rest energy and relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, but actually, the oscillator's total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should be conserved. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum potential energy is converted into maximum kinetic energy. But relativistically, the kinetic energy is a different function. Let me think.

In the non-relativistic case, the total energy E is (1/2)mv_max² + (1/2)kA², and because at maximum displacement, all energy is potential. But wait, no, actually for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E = (1/2)kA². Then when the mass passes through the equilibrium point, all that energy is kinetic: E = (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But that's non-relativistic.

But the problem says it's relativistic, so I must account for relativistic effects. Hmm.

In relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but in the oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². So at maximum displacement, the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. But when the mass is at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy? Or is it just the sum of potential and kinetic? Wait, in classical terms, E = K + U. So when x=A, U is max, K is zero. When x=0, U is zero, K is max.

But relativistically, the energy is a bit more complicated. The total energy E would be the sum of rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy.

But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². So at x=A, U = (1/2)k A². So the total energy would be (1/2)k A², but that's the potential energy, and since in relativity, the rest energy is mc², which is much larger unless v is near c. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should start from the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The force is F = -k x, but in relativity, F is d(p)/dt, and p = gamma m v. So the equation becomes m gamma v' = -k x. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe it's a differential equation that's more complex than the standard SHM equation.

Alternatively, perhaps using energy conservation. The total energy E in the oscillator's frame would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, but also considering the potential energy. Wait, but the potential energy is part of the total mechanical energy.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about when the oscillator is at maximum displacement x=A. At that point, the velocity is zero. So the total energy would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the potential energy (1/2 k A²). But wait, no, because in relativity, the potential energy is part of the mechanical energy, which is separate from the rest mass energy. So maybe the total energy is mc² plus the mechanical energy, which is 1/2 k A².

When the oscillator is at x=0, the velocity is maximum. At that point, the potential energy is zero, but the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy is mc² plus the relativistic kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) mc² = (gamma mc²) - mc².

Wait, but the mechanical energy (1/2 k A²) is the same at all points, so it's the same whether x=A or x=0. So when x=A: E_total = mc² + 1/2 k A². When x=0: E_total = mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc².

So setting these equal: gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2 k A²). Let's rearrange this.

gamma = 1 + (1/(2 m c²)) k A².

Wait, because:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2 k A²)

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So gamma = 1 + alpha.

Then, 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + alpha.

Rearranging to solve for v.

Take reciprocal of both sides: sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Square both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2).

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So substituting back:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Let me compute 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) as (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²). Wait, no: 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² = (2 m c² / (2 m c² + k A²))².

Then 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 = [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, perhaps another way: compute 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2] = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

(1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So numerator is 2 alpha + alpha².

Thus,

v_max² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is a small term unless k A is comparable to m c².

But perhaps we can write the expression as v_max = c sqrt( (2 alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2 ), assuming alpha is small. Wait, but no, because 2 alpha + alpha² is from (1 + alpha)^2 - 1. Let me not approximate yet.

So let's express alpha as (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

Wait, no, the expression is:

v_max = c sqrt( ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Which simplifies to sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha) ) * c.

But I think it's easier to keep it in terms of alpha.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, when I set up the energy equation, I said E_total when x=A is mc² + (1/2 k A²), and when x=0, it's gamma mc².

So,

gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + (1/2 k A^2)

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

gamma = 1 + alpha, where alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So, gamma = 1 + alpha.

Then,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha)

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha²,

So numerator becomes 2 alpha + alpha²,

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2

Factor numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha )

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2

But I want to express this in terms of (k A^2)/(2 m c²) which is alpha.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression differently.

Wait, another approach: let's note that 2 alpha + alpha^2 = alpha (2 + alpha) = alpha (alpha + 2)

But I don't see an immediate simplification.

Looking at the options:

Option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which is [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha )^2 )

Factor numerator:

sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

So,

sqrt(alpha (2 + alpha)) / (1 + alpha) ) * c

Hmm, none of the options seem to match this exactly.

Wait, perhaps we can manipulate the expression further.

sqrt(alpha (2 + alpha)) / (1 + alpha ) ) = [ sqrt(alpha) * sqrt( (2 + alpha) ) ] / (1 + alpha )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Looking back at the options. Let's look at option B:

v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Wait, no, let me read option B again. Option B is:

B) v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, that would be sqrt(1 + [1/(1 - beta)] ), where beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

Hmm, that's not matching. Let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - beta) = (1 - beta +1 )/(1 - beta) ) = (2 - beta)/(1 - beta).

The square root of that would be sqrt( (2 - beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which doesn't seem to match anything I have.

Option D is v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which is [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, that's exactly what I have:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²)/(1 + alpha )^2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

Which is sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm, but none of the options directly match this.

Wait, let me compute the expression:

(2 alpha + alpha^2) = alpha (alpha + 2 )

(1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So the fraction becomes [ alpha (alpha + 2) ] / (1 + alpha )^2

Which is [ alpha ( (alpha + 1) + 1 ) ] / (1 + alpha )^2

Wait, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, I could write the fraction as [ alpha (alpha + 2) ] / (alpha + 1 )^2.

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: alpha (alpha + 2 ) = alpha (alpha + 1 + 1 )

Denominator: (alpha +1 )^2.

Hmm, not seeing a clear simplification.

Wait, perhaps I can manipulate the expression under the square root.

v^2 = c^2 * [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / (1 + alpha )^2

= c^2 * [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha )^2

= c^2 * [ alpha ( (1 + alpha) + 1 ) ] / (1 + alpha )^2

= c^2 * [ alpha (1 + alpha) + alpha ] / (1 + alpha )^2

= c^2 * [ alpha (1 + alpha ) ]/(1 + alpha )^2 + [ alpha ]/(1 + alpha )^2 )

= c^2 * [ alpha/(1 + alpha) ) + alpha/(1 + alpha )^2 ]

Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'll substitute back the value of alpha.

alpha = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) ) / (1 + alpha )

= c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

But I don't see any of the options matching this.

Wait, let me check the given options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, no, that can't be because the denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2m) )^2, which is not the same as what I have.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Which is sqrt( 1 + 1/(1-beta) ), where beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

That would be sqrt( (1 - beta +1 )/(1 - beta) ) ) = sqrt( (2 - beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Hmm, doesn't match.

Option C is v_max = sqrt( k A^2 / m ), which is non-relativistic, so probably not the right answer.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly the same as the expression I obtained.

Wait, let me compute this.

In our calculation, we have v_max = c sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha )^2

Wait, no, the expression for v_max is sqrt( [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ] / (1 + alpha )^2 ) * c.

Which is sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha ) ) * c.

But if I compute 1 - (1/(1 + alpha)^2 ), that's ( (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) = (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha )^2.

So sqrt( [2 alpha + alpha^2] / (1 + alpha )^2 ) = sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm, but that's not the same as option D.

Wait, option D says v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 )

Which is sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]) * c.

Which is sqrt( [ (1 + alpha )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2 ) * c.

Which is sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) ) / (1 + alpha ) * c.

Which matches our expression.

Wait, so option D is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2 )

Which is exactly the same as what I derived.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but another way to check: when the amplitude A is very small, then (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) is much less than 1, so alpha is small.

In that case, 1 + alpha ≈ 1.

So 1/(1+alpha)^2 ≈ 1.

So 1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - 1 = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, alpha is small, so when alpha is small, 1 + alpha ≈ 1, so 1/(1+alpha)^2 is approximately 1 - 2 alpha. So,

1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2 alpha ) = 2 alpha.

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt( 2 alpha ) = c sqrt( 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) = c sqrt( k A²/(m c²) ) = (A k / (m c) )^(1/2) * c.

Wait, let me compute that:

sqrt( k A²/(m c²) ) = (A sqrt(k/m c²) )

Wait, that's not matching the non-relativistic result, which is sqrt( k A²/m ) = A sqrt( k/m )

Wait, but in the non-relativistic limit, c is very large, so (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) → 0, so alpha → 0.

In that case, option D becomes v_max ≈ c sqrt(1 - (1 - 2 alpha )) = c sqrt(2 alpha ) = c sqrt( (2 alpha) ), because when alpha is small, 1/(1+alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 alpha.

Wait, but wait: 1/(1+alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 alpha + 3 alpha^2 - ... So,

1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2 alpha + 3 alpha^2 ) = 2 alpha - 3 alpha^2.

So, for small alpha, it's approximately 2 alpha.

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt(2 alpha ) = c sqrt( 2 (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) = c * sqrt( (k A²) / (m c^2) ) ) = sqrt( (k A²) / (m c^2) ) * c = sqrt( (k A²)/(m) ) * sqrt( 1/(c^2) ) * c ) = sqrt( k A² / m ) * (1/c) * c ) = sqrt( k A² / m ), which matches the non-relativistic result.

So, option D gives the correct non-relativistic limit.

But wait, looking at option D again:

D) v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ))^2 )

When (k A²) is much smaller than 2 m c², then (k A^2/(2 m c² )) is small, so the denominator (1 + alpha ) is about 1. So,

1/(1 + alpha )^2 ≈ 1 - 2 alpha.

Thus,

1 - 1/(1 + alpha )^2 ≈ 2 alpha.

So,

v_max ≈ c * sqrt( 2 alpha ) = c * sqrt( 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) = c * sqrt( (k A^2)/( m c^2 ) ) = sqrt( (k A^2)/m ) * (c) / c ) = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which is correct.

So, option D works in the non-relativistic limit.

Looking at the other options:

Option A: If alpha is small, then (k A^2)/(2m) is being used, but without the c^2 in denominator. So when c is large, (k A^2)/(2m) is very large, but in reality, it's (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) which is small. So option A would give a much larger v_max than possible. So probably incorrect.

Option B: for small alpha, sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - alpha )) is approx sqrt( (1 - alpha +1 )/(1 - alpha )) ) = sqrt( (2 - alpha )/(1 - alpha )) ≈ sqrt(2 (1 - alpha/2 )/(1 - alpha )) ) which for small alpha is around sqrt(2 (1 - alpha/2 )) ) ≈ sqrt(2) - ... Not matching the non-relativistic limit.

Option C is non-relativistic, but the question is about the relativistic case. So it's probably not the correct answer here.

So the correct answer must be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \(v_{\text{max}}\) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \(m\), maximum amplitude \(A\), and obeying Hooke's law (\(F = -kx\)), we analyze the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the relativistic kinetic energy, which must equal the potential energy at maximum displacement.

The potential energy at maximum amplitude \(A\) is \(U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2\). At maximum velocity, all the energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:

\[
K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\). The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \(\alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \(v^2/c^2\):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Substituting \(\alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\):

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \(v_{\text{max}} = c\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}\). This does not match the derived expression and incorrectly omits \(c^2\) in the denominator, leading to an incorrect result.
- **Option B**: \(v_{\text{max}} = c\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}\). This form does not match the derived expression and would overestimate \(v_{\text{max}}\) for small \(\alpha\).
- **Option C**: \(v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}}\). This is the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects, so it is incorrect for this problem.
- **Option D**: \(v_{\text{max}} = c\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}\). This matches the derived expression exactly.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately accounts for relativistic effects and reduces to the non-relativistic result in the limit of small \(\alpha\).

Answer: D
