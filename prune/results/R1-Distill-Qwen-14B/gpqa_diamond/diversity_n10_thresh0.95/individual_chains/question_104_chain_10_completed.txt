Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar in mass to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The main point is about the periodic shift in the spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. For Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c, right? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the Doppler shift formula is delta lambda / lambda = v/c. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula, but I think I can proceed.

So the shift in wavelength (delta lambda) is proportional to the velocity of the star (v) because if the star is moving towards us, the wavelength shifts blue (shorter), and if moving away, it's red (longer). The shift here is periodic because the star orbits the center of mass with the planet, causing it to move towards and away from us periodically.

The RV method tells us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K). So K is the maximum velocity the star moves due to the planet's orbit. The formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (some factor) ) wait, maybe I should look up the formula.

Oh wait, I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, assuming the inclination i is 90 degrees (edge-on orbit, which gives maximum velocity, but the problem says the shifts are detected, so i is likely the same for both planets, but maybe I don't need to worry about it since it's the same for both planets.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I should write this more clearly. Let's see:

K ∝ (M_p / M_s^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

But wait, I think the correct formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_p + M_s) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (1-e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_s, M_p + M_s ≈ M_s, so:

K ≈ (G * M_p / M_s )^(1/3) * (2π/(P (1-e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3) )

For circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1. So K simplifies to:

K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / ( M_s ) )^(1/3) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3 )

Which can be written as:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_s ) ]^(1/3) * ( 2π )^(1/3) / P^(1/3 )

Combining the terms:

K = ( G M_p (2π) )^(1/3) / ( M_s^(1/3) P^(1/3) )

Alternatively, K is proportional to ( M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_s^(1/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, but since the two stars have the same mass, M_s is the same for both planets. Also, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. So in that case, what affects K?

Wait, but in our problem, the detected shifts are different: 5 milliangstroms for planet 1, and 7 for planet 2. But wait, the shift is actually the velocity (K) times the wavelength divided by the speed of light. Because delta lambda / lambda = v/c, so v = (delta lambda / lambda) * c.

So the measured velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to delta lambda / lambda * c, but the exact proportionality might differ based on the instrument's setup. But since both are measured on the same spectral line, the lambda is the same for both. So the K is proportional to (delta lambda) because lambda is the same.

So, K1 = 5 miliangstrom, K2=7 miliangstrom. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the orbital period ratio. So since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, let's write the formula again. Since K is proportional to (M_p )^(1/3) / (M_s^(1/3) P^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_s are same for both, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So P ∝ (1/K)^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1?

Wait, wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases.

Wait, for the same M_p and M_s, higher K means shorter period.

In our case, K2 is larger than K1. So P2 < P1.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1.

Wait, no. Wait the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, longer would mean P2/P1 is greater than 1. But according to the above, K2=7/5 K1, which is higher. Therefore, P2 would be smaller than P1, so P2/P1 < 1. But the options include some which are less than 1, others greater.

Wait, let me think again. Let's restate the ratio.

Since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-examine.

Let me write the formula for K:

K = ( (2πG ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_s + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/ (P ) )^(1/3 )

But since M_p << M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. And sin i is around 1 (since the planets are detected, their orbits are likely edge-on, i=90 degrees).

So, K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( M_s^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

But since both planets have same M_p and same M_s, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Because K1 = constant * 1/P1^(1/3 )

Similarly, K2 = constant * 1/P2^(1/3 )

So K1 / K2 = (1/P1)^(1/3) / (1/P2)^(1/3) ) = [ P2 / P1 ]^(1/3 )

So,

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

We have K1=5, K2=7.

So,

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Calculate 5/7: approximately 0.714.

0.714^3 is about (0.714)^2 = 0.51, then 0.51 * 0.714 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364. Which means P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, which means it's shorter. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2/P1 is ~0.36, which is less than 1. So it's shorter, meaning P2 is shorter, so P2 is ~0.36 times P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's 0.36 times, which is shorter, so the answer would be that it's about 0.36 times longer. But wait, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1?

So, P2 = x * P1. We want x. If x is greater than 1, P2 is longer. If x is less than 1, P2 is shorter.

In our calculation, x = P2/P1 ≈ (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364, which is less than 1. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So it's shorter, not longer. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if x is 0.36, P2 is 0.36 * P1. So the period of P2 is shorter. So the question's answer is 0.36 times longer, meaning it's actually shorter, but the options have 0.36 as option A. So the answer would be A) ~0.36.

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the ratio. Let me double-check the formula.

We have K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So solving for P2/P1:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, earlier I said K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, let's re-express it.

From K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = k * (1/P1^(1/3) ), K2 = k * (1/P2^(1/3) )

Then K1/K2 = (1/P1) / (1/P2) )^(1/3 ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So,

(K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

In our case, K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So (5/7)^3 = (approx 0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So P2's period is shorter than P1.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So 0.36 times longer, which is the same as being shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, the options given are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the correct answer is option A.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) shifts. Both planets orbit stars with the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), based on the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since the stars and planets are similar in mass, the relationship simplifies to:

\[
K_1 / K_2 = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio \( K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7 \approx 0.714 \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
\left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1, meaning it is shorter. However, the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1. Since \( P_2 / P_1 \approx 0.36 \), the period of Planet #2 is 0.36 times longer than that of Planet #1.

From the options provided:

- **A) ~0.36**: Correct, as calculated above.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as this would imply \( P_2 \) is longer than \( P_1 \), which contradicts the results.
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as this is far from the calculated value.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as this is closer to 1 and does not match the calculation.

The correct answer is **A) ~0.36**.

Answer: A
